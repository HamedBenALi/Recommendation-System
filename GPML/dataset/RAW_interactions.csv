38094,40893,2/17/2003,4,Great with a salad. Cooked on top of stove for 15 minutes.Added a shake of cayenne and a pinch of salt.  Used low fat sour cream.  Thanks.
1293707,40893,12/21/2011,5,"So simple, so delicious! Great for chilly fall evening. Should have doubled it ;)<br/><br/>Second time around, forgot the remaining cumin. We usually love cumin, but didn't notice the missing 1/2 teaspoon!"
8937,44394,12/1/2002,4,This worked very well and is EASY.  I used not quite a whole package (10oz) of white chips.  Great!
126440,85009,2/27/2010,5,I made the Mexican topping and took it to bunko.  Everyone loved it.
57222,85009,10/1/2011,5,"Made the cheddar bacon topping, adding a sprinkling of black pepper. Yum!"
52282,120345,5/21/2005,4,very very sweet. after i waited the 2 days i bought 2 more pints of raspberries and added them to the mix. i'm going to add some as a cake filling today and will take a photo.
124416,120345,8/6/2011,0,"Just an observation, so I will not rate.  I followed this procedure with strawberries instead of raspberries.  Perhaps this is the reason it did not work well.  Sorry to report that the strawberries I did in August were moldy in October.  They were stored in my downstairs fridge, which is very cold and infrequently opened.  Delicious and fresh-tasting prior to that, though.  So, keep a sharp eye on them.  Personally I would not keep them longer than a month.  This recipe also appears as #120345 posted in July 2009, which is when I tried it.  I also own the Edna Lewis cookbook in which this appears."
2000192946,120345,5/10/2015,2,"This recipe was OVERLY too sweet.  I would start out with 1/3 or 1/4 cup of sugar and jsut add on from there.  Just 2 cups was way too much and I had to go back to the grocery store to buy more raspberries because it made so much mix.  Overall, I would but the long narrow box or raspberries.  Its a perfect fit for the recipe plus a little extra.  I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was exceptionally over-sweet.  If you make this simple recipe, MAKE SURE TO ADD LESS SUGAR!"
76535,134728,9/2/2005,4,Very good!
273745,134728,12/22/2005,5,Better than the real!!
353911,134728,9/26/2006,5,"Absolutely AWESOME! I was speechless when I tried them. I've never had such juicy melt-in-your-mouth chicken made AT HOME!

I would, however, suggest to reduce the amount of flour. 2 cups was overkill for me. "
190375,134728,3/9/2007,5,These taste absolutely wonderful!!  My son-in-law loves them and requests them often! I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.
468945,134728,2/20/2008,0,"Made my own buttermilk w/ vinegar and milk.  Used defrosted fresh skinless/boneless chicken fillets.  3 lbs.
This mix is extremely flavorful and its light .  I didnt do the bbq thing, but while I cooked homemade to go w/ this I put the chicken in the oven to keep warm and served bbq dipping sauce.  10 stars from my kids !"
255338,134728,4/11/2008,5,"First time using liquid smoke in a recipe. Made this as directed. My kids enjoyed this, so we will make this again. Thank you for posting."
1171894,134728,4/21/2009,5,"MMMMM! This is so good! I actually soaked the chicken in chicken bouillon first, and it made it super flavorful. I use Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce (DH's favorite), and cut chicken into nuggets instead of strips. This makes a good amount, so you could really freeze some and reheat in oven later. Those were our plans, but it was so good that it didn't make it to the ziploc bag!"
136726,197160,11/25/2006,5,"I used this mix to make meat balls.Very simple to put together.  I made a batch to put in the freezer too. I find meatballs are really handy to have around just add sauce and cheese for pasta meal or appetizer or for subs or snack.  These turned out to be very good I did add some garlic, but other than that I followed the recipe. The cinnamon in this added something to this that sets it apart from most meatball recipes I tried. Thanks for posting."
68960,200236,12/19/2006,4,"We really enjoyed this and so did both my young daughters. For this recipe I decided my crockpot would be perfect. I basically followed the recipe exactally except instead of adding the flour to the onions, I made a mix of flour, salt and pepper in a bag and then tossed the lamb to coat before browning. I added the spices to the onion/garlic to toast them slightly before deglazing with stock. Because I used the crockpot I cut the stock back to about 1/2 - 3/4 cup and used all the canned tomatoes. I added the canned chickpeas about an hour before serving.  This ended up cooking in the crockpot on low for about 6-7 hours. Served with Recipe #96875 this is a fabulous, filling family meal. Thank you for posting."
618928,200236,10/17/2007,4,this is an excellent got 'lamb and a tin of chickpeas what should I cook' recipe. I used our slow cooker too. I made it for 4-5 people ( so 680grms lamb).I followed the recipe but used a can of tomatoes and alittle stock ( maybe 1/4 cup) and transfered the simmered tomatoes to the lamb waiting in the slow cooker. On low for about 5-6 hrs perfect!
217118,200236,4/18/2008,5,"This was a lovely Morrocan style dish. I halved the recipe and made it on the stove top like a stew. I added a bit more stock to keep it from drying out. I left off the parsley and/or cilantro, didn't have any. Served with some warm pita type flat breads. I have a VERY picky Husband that even enjoyed this dish."
2000049093,200236,3/8/2015,5,"I love lamb stew and usually make an Irish version with potatoes, celery, carrots, onions or something close.  Now and then I&#039;m looking for a change of pace.  Using this recipe as a basis this turned out a really tasty and healthy lamb stew.   I plan to alternate this with the Irish style.  Mmm.  

I used the canned tomatoes, chickpeas, onion, garlic, also a little celery, a jalapeno pepper, and diced-up carrot and malanga root.  Used cumin, cinnamon, ginger, rosemary,  and cloves as well as salt and pepper.  Nice peppy flavor.

Looks great as well, if I get the camera working hope to send a picture."
202555,225241,6/20/2007,5,"My husband has just found out that he had to cut down on fat. He..like a lot of Okies is a solid meat and potato guy. 
It has been really hard to find things that he likes to eat but this recipe fit the bill. Has a wonderful flavor and we didn't miss the beef at all with this.
I would highly recommend!!!"
353579,225241,8/14/2007,5,"Very good, made with ingredients I usually have.  I didn't want to heat up my kitchen, so I did the final cooking in the microwave, which worked just fine.  Thanks for posting!"
635209,225241,11/6/2007,4,"Thought this was a great Core recipe.  My 79-year-old mom loved it too.  I did multiply the proportions x 3 or 4 so I could use whole cans of beans/Ro-tel tomatoes.  Also just added whole egg to the topping due to time and it was very good, but probably not as light as with egg white. I also was out of chicken broth and just used water and upped the seasonings; and used part shredded chicken and part canned chicken breast.  I made it spicy and served it with fat-free sour cream on top.  A winner!!"
681408,225241,3/14/2008,0,This is a very good recipe.  We also want to cut back on the fat content in our diet . Very tasty dish!!!
684460,225241,1/18/2009,5,We really liked this recipe - something different with chicken is always good to find.  The topping is really good - the kids thought it looked like a twinkie.  They really liked it; even if it wasn't a giant twinkie.
900992,225241,2/19/2009,3,"The ""cornbread"" on top is bland. I'd us a real cornbread recipe and put it on top instead."
135017,254596,9/29/2007,5,"I am extremely picky about my crockpot recipes (don't like most). This one was great! I made a half-recipe with 1 lb. of pork chops. Because my crockpot tends to burn meat (it's old, with the element on the bottom), I put the fruit mixture in first, then put the chops on top. I then spooned some of the fruit mixture on top of the meat. While at work I remembered I forgot to halve the wine (hee hee) but they still turned out just fine. Thanks, lazyme!
P.S.  I forgot to note that I did not do the cornstarch part and it was fine -- it made a juicy gravy that was nice with the mashed potatoes I also made.  Also, I did not have fresh cranberries and used a scant 1/2 cup of craisins instead, and that was fine, too.  It's all good, lazyme!"
224088,254596,10/21/2007,4,"Pork + fruit + crockpot = awesome.

A very good recipe!  Like the other reviewer, we used only about a pound of pork chops, had to sub dried cranberries and didn't bother with the cornstarch.  I didn't really chop things up, just quartered and cored the apples and threw the dried apricots in wholeâ€”everything cooked down to bits. I also skipped the wine.  The apricots and cranberries provided a very intense, rich taste that went great with the pork.  Thanks for the recipe!"
582223,254596,12/9/2007,5,really good my 18 month old loved it and she's really picky. I wasn't sure what type of wine to use so I used red. Thanks for the recipe!
1413963,254596,10/15/2009,5,One word says it all . Delicious!!!
483827,306785,7/15/2008,5,Being a  huge fan of America's Test Kitchen  I just had  to try this and I am  sure glad I did. It is really good. Sweet  corn is  just  coming in season here  and I have  chives in my herb garden so I had all the  best ingredients. I did  use a Jalapeno from the  garden instead of the  habanero. I  just made this and I plan to have it with some chicken. I'll  bet you could use some nice peaches to change it up a bit.      Thanks for posting .
56680,79222,11/11/2006,5,"Oh, This was wonderful!  Had a soup and salad dinner and most people barely ate salad, LOL.  This doubled easily and reheats well too!"
5060,310237,5/7/2010,5,"wow red and white sweetness!  DH loved them , I found them a bit two sweet for me but a nice change to serve strawberries.  very easy recipe, but I think 8 ounces of strawvberries is not enough, if I make them again I will double the strawberries and use about half of the cool whip. (I use light cool whip.)  Thanks for posting."
935485,321038,6/22/2009,5,Being a healthy bar this is very good.  I make just a couple of changes.  I used stevia instead of splenda.  I used recipe #81194 for the egg substitue.  And I used pure vanilla extract instead of the coffee mate.  I will be making a lot of these!
539686,321038,3/28/2011,5,My very health conscious daughter and I tripled this recipe and love them as cookie-sized treats. Very filling and healthy too. Thanks for posting.
6258,20930,7/9/2002,5,"Jan, what an interesting combination of flavors.
Really unique and very tasty.  I am so proud of myself because I am growing an herb garden and I had the chives and oregano (fresh).  You didn't specify whether the sundried tomatoes were oil packed or dry, so I chose the dry ones since you had olive oil listed.  I didn't have the pine nuts, so I used sunflower seeds, and that worked out well.  I loved eating this salad...no real cooking on a hot evening.  I will make this one again.  I am wondering how fresh tarragon would be instead of the oregano?  Maybe I will be brave and make it that way soon.  If I do, I will let you know how the substitution fit in.  Thanks for posting this one!"
102602,20930,10/26/2003,5,"Jan, we love your pasta salad, it's delicious. I've never used chives in a pasta salad before, it adds a very nice flavor. I made a few changes, I omitted the bacon and served the pine nuts on the side (DS HATES pine nuts). I added some extra garlic, a grating of parmesan cheese and some fresh basil (couldn't resist, it's grows right next to the oregano and chives in my garden). I'll be making this again... soon. Thanks for posting this recipe! "
172467,29093,8/24/2009,5,"Lucious cake, firm on the outside, warm and creamy inside. Looks like you slaved away all day but the directions are easy. I will definitely make this again. it's a keeper! Thanks for posting."
2042100,29093,10/23/2011,5,"Amazing recipe! The cakes taste even better than the ones you get in most restaurants. Everyone loves it! Easy and on the spot.<br/><br/>Usually I divide it by 3, since there's only my fiancee and me in my house and the regular amount can last for a week."
2002068522,29093,3/26/2018,0,i made it and it was amazing
58332,41090,2/25/2003,4,"The flavor of the vinegar was a little too ""whang!"" for me so I added a little olive oil.  This tempered the acidity and made a really good lunch. Thank you!"
160497,41090,4/22/2007,5,"I have made this several times now.  I substitute regular white vinegar for the white wine vinegar and the whole family enjoys this!  The dressing does not overwhelm the flavors of the vegetables. I also have doubled the recipe, using one can black beans and one can red beans with two cans white beans for a different color combination."
67026,60656,5/8/2004,4,Good basic recipe that i used as the basis of some great red sauce.  Thanks!
183565,79222,2/13/2006,5,"Wow!  My family loves this recipe and it is a great winter meal.  I do have to say that I adjusted a little but the base remains the same.  Here's what I did different:  I peeled my potatoes and diced them very small. I left out the creamed corn, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and parsley.  Instead I used approx. 1 tsp of Old Bay seasoning. Then right before I stirred in the crab meat, I used my potato masher to mash up some of the potatoes.  This makes the chowder a little thicker.  These are all just my personal preferences.  I have made this several times and have forgotten to review it.  It's awesome!  Thanks Pantry Chef Starkey."
101823,79222,3/21/2006,5,"Excellent chowder.  This was the perfect warm-up at the end of a cold, snowy day.  I used more crab meat than the recipe called for, but otherwise followed the directions.  This was so simple, and worked well to put in the crockpot to keep warm while I waited for Hubby to come home for the evening.  We will make this again."
349752,79222,4/7/2007,5,"Tasty, low fat, fast & easy!  I added 1tsp. of Old Bay Seasoning and 1 tsp. of Cajun Seasoning with a 14 oz. can of crab.  We all like the extra spice.  This recipe would satisfy DH & DS without any side dishes, but I offered saltines & a salad on the side just in case.  Definitely a keeper!"
446143,79222,2/1/2008,4,"Oh, how wonderful!  I doubled the crab, and added some carrots (and some extra broth to compensate.)  We still thought there should be more crab though.  The nutmeg flavor was wonderful and the cayenne added a tiny kick.  Lovely recipe PCS!"
226989,79222,3/7/2008,4,"DH and I enjoyed this. However I used it only as a base for a potato/seafood chowder. I made as is, except that I added about 1/4lb bacon, which I diced and fryed, tossed with 8oz crab the recipe called for and added about 1 cup pre cooked shirmp. Fryed them all together for a moment and put that all into the chowder. I also used a small can of creamed corn, as I'm not a huge fan of it. I think it needs salt for sure, I also increase the nutmeg and cayenne and added a bit of a chilli/garlic sauce. Good soup, I'll use it again."
868654,79222,10/7/2008,5,"Along with the onions we added in a square of salt pork, and fried them up till they were crisp.  We loved this soup, and we will definately have it again when we get the craving for something to warm the tummy!  Thank you!"
1143059,79222,2/12/2009,4,"I made this last nite and it was pretty good.  I will make it again, but am thinking it needs something else.  For one thing, there was no salt in the recepie and I did add that...I think next time Im going to add some shrimp and maybe more spices as I thought it was somewhat bland."
302867,79222,1/5/2010,5,Delish!  Part of my New Years resolution....  rate recipes I've tried.  Substituted Old Bay for cayenne.  Will make again.  Thanks for a keeper!
1316788,79222,2/12/2010,5,Fantastic! I used a little bit of cream since I like a thicker chowder. This was perfect though! A seafood party favorite!
1447190,79222,3/18/2010,5,"really good,I did make adjustments to my needs I used soymilk,and left out cayenne,I added 1 box container of chicken broth which I think was 32 oz? I also chopped the potatoes and onions to a mush in a food chopper so it was easier on my digestion and I served over jasmine rice."
1003295,79222,3/26/2010,5,"I might be slightly biased because I love crab in any and everything, but this was fantastic. I use cream instead of regular milk for a creamier chowder."
930021,79222,6/25/2010,5,"My favorite chowder ever. I may try it with other sea food in future. I wasn't sure about the amounts of garlic and nutmeg, but they blend in really well. I added a couple of dashes of cream."
241697,79222,7/10/2010,5,Really great recipe!! Although I did not have creamed corn..i added extra broth. It thickened up really nice!! Thank-You
980899,79222,10/18/2010,0,"I used half cream and half 1% milk, added another 1/2c cream at the end. Was without nutmeg. Added nearly a whole pkg of bacon and two 6 oz cans of crab. I will come back to rate this after I make it again using all the posted ingredients. Really yummy, I need to add the nutmeg and see what that does to the flavor."
158966,79222,10/20/2010,5,10/18/10 Update. I have to rave again about this recipe. I took the extra time to fry up some bacon and carmelize the onions in the renderings and still added the Old Bay and used the Cajun Seasoning in liu of the cayenne pepper. There were 5 people at the table but I expanded the recipe to feed 9.  I'm glad I did since nearly everyone had seconds. Even my super picky kid likes this!! ****************** 12/22/08: Absolutely fabulous!  This is  so easy to make and oh so satisfying.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of Old Bay and used Cajun seasoning blend in place of the cayenne.  My nine year old son loved it.  Next time I will try adding some bacon like some of the other reviewers have done.  This is a keeper for sure!  Thanks ever so much for sharing.
827374,79222,11/29/2010,3,"We made this last night and really enjoyed it.  I just used canned crab meat and honestly, it didn't really seem to add much flavor to the soup. But really, this can easily just be a chunky potato soup and would be nice and tasty.  I added about 1/2 a cup of thinly sliced carrots and 1/2 a cup of peas which added some nice color, texture and flavor to things.  In addition to the listed seasonings, I used 5 Pepper Seasoning and a few dashes of Italian Seasoning to add some flavor.   Also used 12 oz. of crab and 4 c. of potatoes and added about 1/2 of a cup both broth and milk to compensate for the added volume.  Came out with a nice thickness and is a stick-to-your-ribs kinda meal."
1719774,79222,12/16/2010,5,"This was pretty good.  I could tell that my husband loved it.  Mine was spicy.  I think I added more cayenne and ground pepper than was necessary.  Also, I used pepper from a grinder instead of already ground.  I also used frozen corn instead of creamed, added more flour/cornstarch, and didn't have the nutmeg, so I didn't use it.  Thanks for the recipe."
49304,180132,2/13/2007,5,Delicious easy to make soup which we really enjoyed. Cut the recipe in half & made it just like the recipe stated. This worked really good for our low fat/ low carb diet. I will defintely be making this soup often. Thank you for posting the recipe.
152118,79222,1/2/2011,5,I enjoyed this recipe.  The only change I made was using frozen corn instead of creamed and vegetable stock instead of chicken broth.  I also added about 1/4 cup chopped shrimp since I had some in the fridge and a splash of half and half at the end.  A bit of salt as well. Yummy.
1781977,79222,1/15/2011,4,"Very good base with many options.  First time I added lump crab.  Today went straight vegetarian and sauteed tiny diced zucchini, carrots, sweet red pepper along with the listed veggies (onion, garlic, potato); very colorful and nutritious.  Both times I also added additional sweet frozen corn for a little crunch and sweetness.  Loved the nutmeg. Both times I made this chowder I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and also added 1-2 TBSP of  sherry at the very end.  Very nice combination of flavors and textures.  As stated a above, a good base with limitless combinations of broths/stocks, dairy/soy, seafoods, shredded chicken, etc."
1874846,79222,4/4/2011,0,"FABULOUS!<br/><br/>I could not afford any of the ingredients, so I just used what I had in my kitchen and that is the creamed corn. I warmed it up on medium heat for a few minutes and pretended that I was eating the Potato-Crab Chowder. UNBELIEVABLE! Thanks for this recipe."
1631574,79222,12/3/2012,5,This is an excellent recipe for crab chowder. I followed the recipe with only a few changes. I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper along with the black pepper. I also added about 1/4 cup of sherry at the end of cooking time. We loved it!
1802624639,79222,3/30/2014,5,"I like the nutmeg better than I expected. I did make a few changes. Added cayenne and used fresh crab meat (that I caught the day before). I also couldn&#039;t see making this without celery, so I added celery. One tip, cook this chowder a day in advance and let it set in the fridge overnight. Like most soups, stews and chowders, it&#039;s much better on day two."
1802697284,79222,11/16/2014,0,Awesome chowder! I used both canned and imitation crab. The second added a lot of flavor. I added Old Bay Seasoning as well. Truly yummy!
2002097693,79222,4/5/2018,0,Do you have cook the potatoes beforehand?
337963,87750,9/19/2006,4,"The pepper and allspice, along using bacon grease to grease the pan, made this a very flavorful cornbread.  We enjoyed it!"
226081,127155,6/29/2005,5,"this is my recipe from my website, www.finedinings.com"
185285,127155,8/11/2005,5,"This recipe contained ingredients I knew I liked, in a combonation I wasn't sure of. *Trust me*, if you typically enjoy the bleu cheese, basil & crab - THIS is a your appetizer.  DH, who is very finicky about 'weird' combos adored this dish.  Hint: If you love basil, resist being generous as it competes with the bleu cheese - and that is the base flavor.  I spinkled bleu cheese ontop before baking as well.  This is a great appetizer - thanks for sharing!!"
180087,127155,1/31/2006,5,"Great recipe.  We did use canned  crab, it was excellent.  Made the stuffing a day ahead.  We used med to small white mushroom, and found there was more stuffing than needed.  Crab around here is kind of $$$, so we will probably just make the bread crumb, bacon, & cheese stuffing next time, as we were just as satisfied with them.  Thanks for the recipe, the directions were very clear and it made for nice company appetizers."
240552,127155,3/3/2008,5,"What a wonderful delicious lunch! I made the filling and put it in a portabella.  I used my own bread crumbs, light cheese, Franks Red Hot sauce as I didn't have tobasco so used more, and imitation crab meat as that is what I had on hand.  I ate the whole thing and am quite full!! LOL!  Thanks for the great recipe!"
446143,127155,6/24/2008,5,"DH liked these a lot  Also used the filling in a large portabella cap.  I used an Italian cheese blend and added some mayo to the mixture, and melted some cheese on top too.  Skipped the egg and the wine, and used canned lump crabmeat.  Thanks!"
805572,127155,6/12/2010,5,"The best stuffed mushrooms ever..fresh crab is a must, yummy!!  I will definitely make again, thanks for the great recipe =-)"
1802811100,127155,6/9/2014,5,"These were a big hit at a recent party, and they went like hotcakes!  I didn&#039;t have fresh crab, but the canned crab worked.  They were still good, but I&#039;ll bet they&#039;ll be delicious with the fresh crab.  Either way, a big hit!"
263525,145160,11/17/2005,5,This was really great! It turned out to be really savory.  I made a few adjustments to the amout but it was delicious. Thanks!
58439,180132,6/9/2007,4,"GREAT hearty chicken soup, TRUE!
Does make you feel better too!
Comfort food as comfort can be!
Thanks for sharing this warming recipe!"
628951,180132,11/13/2007,5,Very good and tasty especially when your craving soup on a low carb diet.
2854176,180132,6/7/2013,5,"The best chicken and vegetable I have made! It&#039;s easy, very yummy and low in calories. Thank you!"
101732,180705,11/5/2008,5,You're right...it's good!! The kids loved it! (So did I) I used lean ground turkey but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Thanks so much for postng! Made for My 3 Chef's '08.
52476,181765,8/15/2006,5,"We have been eating this bbq sauce for years!  Fortunately for me I live in Northern Alabama and have access to the restaurant that originated the white bbq sauce (Big Bob Gibson's). It's my understanding that this white sauce is indicative only to Northern Alabama. The only way I have ever seen it eaten or have eaten it myself is with ""smoked"" chicken (either poured over the chicken after its done or used as a dipping sauce).  The combination of the smoked chicken and the tartness of the sauce is heavenly! I make this often in the Summer months and encourage everyone to give it a try!!  "
37722,181765,3/12/2007,5,"This is excellent and the same recipe I've always used except that we increased the amt. of pepper slightly, and added a little sugar and salt to boot. Never tried the red pepper but will. I lived for 34 years in Huntsville, AL before moving to St. Louis, and our favorite place to have white BBQ sauce was the old Greenbrier restaurant on Hwy 20. There we douse grilled chicken with the sauce, but a major treat is their heavenly hushpuppies, to which we also add the white sauce. I grill skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts pre-seasoned only with seasoned salt and serve the white sauce on the side when serving. And Sally's right: the sauce tastes a whole lot better after chilling for a few days. Finally, don't buy commercially bottled white BBQ sauce; it's usually awful. Thanks, Sally!"
135470,181765,5/5/2008,1,I did not care for this at all. All I could taste was the vinegar.
296027,182985,5/19/2007,4,"Very nice,fresh summertime martini.  I will make this again tonight and update my response,leaving out the triple sec and Chambord as an alternative method for myself. I think I really like the taste of watermelon, so I felt the other two might have detracted from the flavor I was anticipating.  Triplesec and Chambord aren't my favorite flavors,so that part may just be me - others should make it as written and determine for themselves how they like it.  I LOVED the icy almost slushines I got from shaking the frozen watermelon too (DH helpd to be sure I was vigorous enough!!)....SOOO fabulous and PINK!!! ;)  Will be making again,in 2 weeks when my friend comes in town! Great recipe addition,Lazyme - thank you!!!"
82616,195132,11/16/2006,5,"Ok, I made this last night durng one of my baking spree moments. part of it is froze and the other is GONE!!! This is a wonderful cake, great taste. I made no changes. Thanks lorrie :)"
92816,195132,12/3/2006,5,This definately deserves 5 stars.I have made various Cherry Cakes and loaves over the years but this one is the best.I love the top on this.I didn't use any icing sugar but just the nice crispy top is so tasty.I also used baking cherries not maraschino.I'll be making this one every Christmas.Thanks for posting it.
593513,195132,11/19/2010,5,I did write a review for this cake but it seems to of disappeared along with my private notes. I just noticed it because I was going to make it again this weekend. Must of went into that land far far away !!!!!   I found these very moist and delicious cakes. I had made 3 mini bundt cakes and 3 mini loaf pans. They turned out so good. At the time I didn't have the almond extract so I had used vanilla paste. This is definitely a recipe worth more than 5 stars.
1651233,195132,11/14/2011,5,Made this cake this morning and it is so good! This recipe will definitely be a part of my Christmas line up. I made it in two loaf pans and they came out beautifully! I think next time I will replace the cherries with gumdrops and see how that goes. Thanks Lorrie!
9580,208980,2/5/2007,5,"I saw this on 30 Minute Meals too!
This sandwich is amazing!  It is so good.  I omitted adding olive oil to the meatball mixture and the results were fine."
462571,208980,7/5/2007,5,"These were a snap to whip up and were fantastic! I grilled the meatballs on the BBQ, setting them in a grill pan. I served the subs open-faced rather than topping with the other half bun. These made even tastier leftovers!! Thanks for posting!"
376098,208980,8/1/2007,5,This was great! My husband said it tasted just like a chicken parm on a bun without me even telling him the name of the recipe!  We will make this again.
222139,208980,9/8/2007,5,I chose this recipe from Fall Pick A Chef.  Could not have picked out a better one.  Great lunch dinner meal.  Because I made so much I will be freezing the chicken for later use.  Thanks for posting this recipe for us to try.
674484,208980,9/15/2008,5,"Since this is one of my favorites subs, I decided to try making my own instead of going to the sub shop.  I REALLY LOVED this!  I put mine on the rolls, then added the cheese, put in the oven until cheese melted and the roll was toasted and crunchy.  What a great sandwich Jess!"
1251627,208980,6/23/2009,5,"This recipie was so great, the kids loved it. I've also made it with chicken breast on a whole wheat roll for a healthy family dinner."
456221,208980,2/20/2010,5,"This is a favorite here, too-- have made it several times.  This is also good served over pasta."
229619,208980,6/26/2011,5,I was flipping through one of Rachael Ray's cookbooks and this recipe caught my eye so I checked and sure enough it was already posted here. I did use ground turkey instead of chicken since that's what I had on hand.  It was a hit here and I'll definitely be making it again.
280271,219118,11/9/2008,4,This is so yummy. Quick to prepare and can simmer on the stove while you fix the rest of your dinner. It has a nice sweet taste that is not overpowering. Just right. We really enjoyed it. I served it with recipe #211485 and a baked potato. Thanks for posting. :)
305531,219118,12/17/2008,4,Really good carrots! There were a great side dish to go along with some grilled salmon and rice. Thanks carolinafan. Made for I Recommend Tag.
1320855,228530,7/12/2009,5,"I found this recipe by searching for healthy Indian foods. I was a bit skeptical of this recipe but I LOVED it. I was almost like candy, but for dinner and incredibly healthy.
I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable, used 1 1/3 cups canned pumpkin,  chicken broth because I didn't have vegetable, sweet curry powder instead of the regular spicy kind, and the first time I made it I accidentally used ground white pepper (which has a sort of white-wine taste) and it tasted so good I used it the second time. This is a definite new regular meal. Thanks so much for sharing, I absolutely love it, especially the pumpkin-onion combination (which I'd never thought of before). One thing for anyone else trying this: my parents and sister hated it, but they are not pumpkin fans like I am. I personally don't think it tastes SUPER pumpkin-y, but that's just me. Try it out and see how you like it. I was really surprised to find that I was the only one who liked it, because it tastes like heaven to me."
345569,228530,10/5/2009,5,"The last time I tried a bulgur / pumpkin combination, I was disappointed -- even though I like both ingredients -- so I was wary of trying this recipe.  But I am so glad I did, because it was wonderful!  I skipped the oil altogether and didn't miss it.  I also used a buttercup squash instead of pumpkin, and crushed bay leaves since that was all I had; and consomme instead of the vegetable broth.  The curry powder lent such a pretty color to the dish but the flavor wasn't at all overpowering.  Thanks for posting!"
278578,228530,10/3/2010,5,"This is great, my first time really cooking with pumpkin. I subbed quinoa for bulgur and let it cook dry for a few extra minutes before adding the water (I didn't have stock). I added just a little maple syrup because it just seemed to be asking for it. Would make this again, thanks!"
1660185,246902,1/30/2011,5,"Good flavor and my HS and MS kids ate it with no question! Probably better in the Summer sea on to have some great, fresh veggies with this.  Made mashed potatoes and green beans! Will do this easy, good recipe again!"
22174,342209,12/28/2008,4,I am changing my initial review because they got better overnight! At first they seemed a bit blah but I just had one and the sweetness and flavor have improved greatly. Other great thing is these were simple and I had everything on hand! Thank you!
437991,342209,5/25/2009,5,"What a nice change to the banana bread i used to make with too ripe bananas! The bananas were so sweet i  only used a little sugar and shredded cocnuts. Thank you for sharing, made for ZWT5"
423539,342209,6/2/2009,5,"These are lovely cookies not bland at all. 
Of course I had to have one straight out of the oven and they were moist inside and chewy on the outside. The oats, banana and nuts really shine through.
Thank you iewe for a lovely recipe and one I will make often.
Made for the Dining Daredevils team for ZWT5."
1183623,342209,10/28/2009,5,"so good!  i used applesauce in place of the butter/shortening and added extra vanilla instead of lemon juice, and 2 cups of oats just to thicken the batter up a little, and they turned out perfect.  i just wanted something different for lunch snacks and these seem to be a hit!"
495793,342209,12/21/2009,3,"These were just so-so.  I agree with another reviewer that they got better overnight.  I was looking for a use of ripe bananas (instead of my usual banana bread) and I thought these would be great.  They are missing something.  The texture is okay, but I think they need some cinnamon or a little brown sugar or molasses, they were just a bit bland.  I think these good be very good with some work on the ""seasoning"".  Thanks for posting."
444132,342209,2/17/2010,4,"These were wonderful cookies - I'm rating as a 4 instead of a 5, just because I think you need to make sure the batter is a little thicker, or they'll come out a thin and spread more than expected.  I love the flavour, and I did add 1/4 cup of cinnamon chips and the nuts used were walnuts.  I used butter, too, so next time I'll try shortening (or 1/2 and 1/2) and up the oats/flour if needed.  I think once you make these a couple of times and get the consistency down, they'd be the best thing in the cookie jar!  Made for Zaar Stars - thanks, iewe!!!"
669019,342209,5/19/2010,4,"They're like banana bread, in cookie form. I added nutmeg - they would also be good with cinnamon and brown sugar."
678366,342209,6/19/2010,5,We enjoyed these cookies and it was a great way to use the brown bananas. A little cinnamon is also a good addition. Made for ZWT6 and were decorated by DD.
522099,424415,5/21/2010,5,"I really didn't expect to like this rice as much as I did.  It smelled wonderful while it cooked and tasted good by itself.  But what really brought it to 5 stars is the way it supported and elevated the dahl and mushroom dishes I served it with.  A wonderful complement to any Indian dish.  And the leftovers would make a BANGIN' rice pudding...
Made for Looney Spoons ZWT6"
171790,424415,5/22/2010,4,What a wonderful aroma while cooking. Dinner guests rated this from 3 stars(diner prefers plain rice) to 5 stars. I've averaged the ratings. Made for ZWT6.
491979,424415,5/24/2010,5,Perfect rice. We love Basmati RiceMade for ZWT 6  for Queens of Quisine
724516,424415,6/22/2010,5,"Well I got perfect rice also, I served this with recipe#392938#392938 and the two went very well together. I kind of crushed my cardamom a bit to let the flavour out, you could really taste the two spices. A very nice recipe. Thank you for posting. Made for ZWT#6 2010."
480195,424415,6/25/2010,5,The rice turned out perfectly and had good flavor. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Made for ZWT6.
852554,424415,8/23/2012,5,This was great rice and I loved that it was made in my rice cooker!  I subbed about half the water with coconut milk as I had some leftover from another recipe. Made for ZWT 8
422608,441096,2/26/2016,5,"I didn&#039;t follow the instructions exactly, but it came out awesome! Oh and my husband has no clue I put pumpkin in it. He can&#039;t wait to eat it again tonight!"
230860,442352,1/9/2011,5,"These were very good.  Maybe my sourdough loaf was small, but I got 4 sandwiches out of this using the stated amounts for each ingredient.  I really liked the crust on the outside of the bread and the kick from the red pepper.  I also really enjoyed the flavors of the turkey, muenster, avocado and cilantro together."
1232945,487707,10/8/2012,0,"Loved this salsa flavored meatloaf...tang is a nice touch, and so healthy:)"
27378,21531,3/8/2002,5,This is also known as noodle kugle. I love it. It is one of my favorites.
35555,21531,3/20/2002,1,"I found this pudding, extremely discusting.  It was way to rich for my taste buds, and it's texture was not one to my liking. Yuck!"
89210,33486,6/8/2003,4,This is pretty good !! I used frozen spinach :( probably won't do that again ! next time I'm considering sour creme and poppyseeds too
227666,36144,11/4/2005,4,"I halved this recipe, and it turned out pretty good, except for maybe a little too much vanilla extract for my taste. I might be making again for one of those warm, summer nights. :]"
53932,36144,7/16/2006,5,"I also halved the recipe and not reading it carefully, used vanilla yogurt rather than plain.  I love vanilla so with the addition of even more, I liked this!  Perfect treat for a hot summer day."
442988,36144,5/30/2007,3,"I'm sorry I couldn't give this a higher rating ... I appreciated the fact that this could be made so that it's virtually nonfat.  But I thought there was too much gelatin in it -- in fact, when I tried to pour the base mixture into the ice cream freezer, it had already solidified into a gelatinous, mass.  (I used Trader Joe's plain nonfat yogurt).  I'll keep looking for my platonic ideal of vanilla frozen yogurt -- but thanks for posting this!"
490060,36144,6/22/2007,5,"i have had no problem with the gelatin, as another user has posted.  I have only had good results, the most fluffy, light, dreamy, creamy frozen yogurt I have ever made. DEFINITELY the best vanilla frozen yogurt I have had."
447165,36144,8/28/2007,5,I halved this (except the vanilla- oops!) for my Cuisinart icecream maker as a couple others did-- great stuff!  We are excited to try it tomorrow after it's ripened too because the super-frozen parts left in the bowl were the best we thought.  We didn't find we needed to chill the mixture after adding the yogurt and vanilla because the yogurt came straight from the fridge.  I love that this is low fat and the gelatin insead of eggs which make me nervous to use uncooked.  Thanks Tom!
464253,36144,5/6/2008,4,"On the first night, the yogurt was a great consistency, creamy and fluffy. Unfortunately, it got pretty hard and icy after sitting in the freezer overnight. Better than other recipes I've tried in that regard and maybe it just can't be avoided with home made. Definitely try this, it's delicious!"
176615,36144,6/10/2008,5,"Excellent! Light, fluffy, and creamy, not icy like homemade lowfat frozen desserts tend to be. I halved the recipe and used the Cusinart ice cream maker. So easy and so healthy, I'll be making this often. Highly suggest Stonyfield Farm or other plain organic yogurt as the flavor and quality is so much better, in my opinion, than regular commercial varieties. Thanks for sharing your recipe! UPDATE: I make this often and especially like using Stonyfield's vanilla yogurt and serving with fresh sliced strawberries or other berries. Also LOVE this with a drizzle of local honey. Yum. To die for!"
1108690,36144,1/2/2009,1,"What a disastrous recipe.  We used fat free yogurt instead of low fat yogurt which could have been the problem, but our concoction was anything but frozen yogurt.  It took a long time for it to finally become a consistency other than regular yogurt.  When it finally did harden, it was like eating flakes of sorbet. Very disappointing.  We will never use this recipe again.  However, we still are looking for a good fat free frozen yogurt recipe, if anyone has any suggestions.  But please, don't make the same mistake we did by using this unsuccessful recipe."
960426,36144,12/16/2009,4,"Just to comment on 
Chef #1108690 's review.  There's no telling how much more gelatin you added to this recipe that was called for by using non-fat yogurt. 
That's how they make fat-free yogurt stand up without any fat.   That accounts for your flakes.  Delicious animal-bone-collagen flakes."
1320105,36144,5/14/2010,2,None of my kids liked this at all.  It still had a bitter taste like yogurt normally does.  Nothing like the frozen yogurt from the stores.
386585,278406,9/29/2008,5,"This is a great variation on the classic Reuben sandwich.  Instead of the tartness of sauerkraut, the sweet and tangy cole slaw mixture was a nice change.  It is also really easy to make, and I will definitely be having this again (and without the guilt of a regular Reuben)!  Thanks for posting, 2Bleu.  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game."
2001891832,183729,4/30/2018,0,There is no cooking temp?????? Love this recipe so I will assume it is 350?????
1202739,36144,9/12/2010,5,"I am AMAZED at the people who DID NOT FOLLOW THE RECIPE, but chose to give it one to three stars.  The recipe calls for LOW FAT yogurt, not non-fat.  Another review makes the point that the reason non-fat yogurt is gelatinous is because of GELATIN!  The recipe was formulated for low-fat yogurt.  I make lots of substitutions in recipes, but I would never PRESUME to rate a recipe for not turning out well when I did not follow the directions.<br/><br/>I thought this recipe turned out very well.  As another reviewer, I halved the recipe because I only had a 32 oz tub of yogurt and was a cup short for the full recipe.  I used low-fat Vanilla yogurt and Splenda instead of sugar.  I also agree with another reviewer that it can go straight in the ice cream maker after incorporating the yogurt and vanilla.<br/><br/>This is very light and refreshing.  My husband and I like intense vanilla flavor, and by using vanilla yogurt and vanilla extract it was quite tasty.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I think next time I may chunk up some fresh pineapple to drop in as well - I think the tartness of the pineapple would go well with the yogurt.  Cheers!"
12657,45119,7/30/2003,3,"The instructions in this recipe are very lucid and easy to follow, but the end result was a little drier than I had hoped. The combination of ingredients worked well but it lacked the 'juice' that perhaps a chopped tomato could have provided. I topped this with a good amount of plain yogurt before serving and that did make it less dry. Thanks for posting, Karyl."
74736,45119,3/26/2004,5,"Thought this was delicious Karyl, it's nice to know sweet potatos CAN be made without brown sugar or marshmellows! This recipe almost reminded me of some smothered hashbrowns we had that were enjoyed all around, only a lot less greasy:)"
1802694935,45119,11/27/2014,5,I found this to be a very good take off on sweet potatos.  The use of olive oil was a good addition to this recipe that really made the difference.  The sweet peppers were also a plus.  For something different.  Go this one!!!
56112,58758,4/18/2003,4,"Real good recipe.  Will definately make this again.  I probably will not add quite as much sugar to the next batch.  This one was just a little too sweet for my taste.  For those who like their coffee really sweet, it will be just perfect the way it is.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
29621,58758,7/31/2004,5,"Thanks for the great recipe!

I used Splenda instead of Sugar, still Excellent!

"
537179,58758,11/21/2008,4,Nice recipe! I scaled this down for 2. Was nice and easy. Great taste.
583401,138839,9/5/2011,5,"This was delicious. I used butter instead of margarine which probably added a lot more fat then necessary.. but these are for my brother who needs the extra calories. Easy, fast, and tasty."
326970,161899,10/27/2006,5,"I made this Jambalaya and we all loved it.  I didn't add all the cayenne pepper at once as DH isn't nuts about hot'n'spicy.  Used regular frozen corn rather than baby corn chopped.  Excellent.  My crock pot was too small so finished on the stove top.  Next time I make it, I'll cut it in half."
320245,181439,9/29/2006,5,"Amazing - I always love your recipes, kittencal! I cook for very large groups on a very small budget, so in lieu of the zucchini I just added several cans of corn. Also (I'm in Switzerland), since cheddar cheese is expensive, I subsituted Fontal cheese in the dumplings and added quite a bit more cayenne than it called for. It was a hit! Thanks so much for all of your great cooking ideas!"
44642,190875,10/19/2006,0,"Just posting, so I will know I tryed this. Never have found one of his recipes that I like. Did not make the polenta."
162191,190875,10/20/2006,5,I loved this recipe.
137302,224025,4/18/2012,2,This is probably one of those toppings which has to become an acquired taste.  It seemed to have an off taste to me that may have come from the cornstarch.  Honey is thick on it's own when cooled slightly and I think that if someone wanted their honey and butter mixed they would do better to just mix and heat them without the cornstarch.  Made for PAC Spring 2012
238496,254859,10/4/2007,4,Delicious and fresh are the words I would choose for this recipe. I gave four stars because I like very spicy food. This is a personal observation only and not a critiscim of this recipe. I recommend it. My changes were to add a habenero chili as well. I sauted it over a low flame for 5-6 minutes. This kicks up the heat factor. Thank you lilchris for a great recipe.
424680,256416,11/2/2009,5,"Made this with raw apple cider & my last bag of frozen cranberries! I used a generous tablespoon of minced orange zest ~ Very nice tasting sauce, although another time I want to try it mixed with a pint or so of homemade chunky applesauce! [Tagged, made & reviewed as part of my Sassy Sauces! theme in the current My 3 Chefs event]"
27443,278406,1/15/2008,5,"If you like Reubens this is a must to try!  I can not say enough about this sandwich. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. I made it as an open face, thus eliminating the calories etc of 1 slice of bread. Thanks for sharing your revision."
803511,278406,6/26/2009,5,"Great Reuben variation!  I liked making the coleslaw/sauerkraut myself.  I added an extra handful of cabbage into the pot because it was cooking down so much it didn't look like enough for two sandwiches.  When I put the sandwiches together I only ended up using about 2/3 of the meat and 1/2 the cheese called for.  I shredded cheese off a block instead of using slices.  Lastly, I just can't give up my usual Reuben sauce (mayo, chili sauce, horseradish) so we subbed that for the mayo/mustard suggested in your recipe.  I think overall using less cheese and meat brought this ""lighter"" Reuben down even farther!  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
222564,294427,10/25/2012,5,"Great, well balanced, sweet and savory, crispy salad with fruity apple cider vinaigrette. I was tempted to substitute apple juice concentrate to the apple cider to it's reduced quantity, but restrained myself and kept to the recipe."
222478,414099,5/1/2010,5,"Very tasty! One thing I couldn't bring myself to do was combine the melted butter with the breadcrumbs because I think it would have made it too hard to coat the scallops evenly, instead I melted the butter along with the garlic and tossed the mix around with the scallops, then dipped in the breadcrumbs. It was much enjoyed over a bed of couscous."
780172,414099,7/3/2013,5,This is a super easy dish to prepare. I felt it lacked a little seasoning so added a little Old Bay Seasoning. I got to use parsley from my garden. Nice way to make scallops.
1609258,443932,9/13/2011,4,"Good but garlicy.  It didn't really have that umami taste that real boursin has but it is still good as a dip or a spread.  It gets better with age so don't judge based on how it taste straight out of the food processor.  I couldn't find the umeboshi plum paste but I did find some pickled umeboshi pickled plums that I tossed into the food processor with everything else.  If you can't find the plums, I think a good sub would be miso paste."
364211,463367,9/7/2011,5,"WOW! What a sandwich. Loved, loved, loved the sauce. I did not expect this to be so good.  I would give this an 8 star rating if I could.  I used thin sliced whole wheat bread that I keep in the freezer because I don't use bread a lot.  Purchased the meat and cheese especially for this sandwich, except I made a mistake and ordered provolone instead of swiss.  I used a dill pickle relish that I already had and put a thin layer on the sandwich.  Next time I will make with the swiss cheese.  gailanng, thanks so much for posting"
4470,27551,10/17/2002,4,"At the request of the chef  I reviewed the amounts of the ingredients and came up with the following:
1 can French beans or 3/4 lb fresh, frenched beans
2 14 oz cans Artichoke hearts
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup parmesan cheese, grated
1/2 cup bread crumbs
2 tbsp butter
4 cloves garlic, crushed
1 can French's Fried Onions
Salt & pepper to taste
Followed the steps except for the fried onions I did not add them until the final 15 minutes.
  This is a very tasty recipe with a different veggie combination.  Easy to put together and great flavor..  The recipe had more bread crumbs in it than I used.  I think this would  be very tasty but I wanted to cut back on the crumbs and Olive oil. Thanks Kari for a lovely addition to my cookbook.  This is a 5 star recipe but because of the changes I made to it I rated it a 4 star."
22898,27551,11/29/2002,4,I followed Bergy's quantities for this recipe so I can't give it a 5 but it is delicious and I will usee it again.  I do agree with Bergy that it is a 5.
873573,27551,12/29/2009,5,"I love the idea of mixing artichokes with green bean casserole!  I made this recipe for my Christmas Eve dinner when I found out that twice as many people were coming and I didn't have enough food prepared.  This is quick and easy and tasted great!  I didn't have any breadcrumbs so I mixed in a little cram of mushroom soup to keep it glued, but I will definitely try again with the bread crumbs.  Nice play on the traditional casserole! =)"
68460,56494,5/3/2003,5,"These cakes couldn't be quicker, easier and more delicious if they tried.  I used 1 pound of cleaned and deveined shrimp, then all of the rest of the ingredients exactly.  The sweet chilli sauce has the perfect amount of sweet and hot to it to give these wonderful cakes just the right tang.  My husband and I polished off half the batch as quickly as they came out of the frying pan!  We just LOVE these and I'll be making them again and again.  Thanks so much KitchenManiac...these are terrific!"
182292,56494,12/23/2004,5,"Agreed: quick, easy, delicious. An entire platter vanished into a very picky Christmas party crowd, who all looked around for more. And that you can freeze the raw patties for quick cooking later is a huge plus. 

We substituted shrimp for the prawns, lime zest and juice for the leaves, used pre-crushed cornflakes (guessing that 2 c. of flakes crushes down to about 1/4 c. of crumbs). We also tried two sorts of Thai sweet chili sauce...one very sweet and mild, one very spicy. I advise using the spicy one in the prawn cake recipe and then serving with the mild one for dipping."
10033,56494,7/8/2007,5,"Excellent recipe, loved by all. I had a hard time finding lime leaves in the amount of time I had to shop (I know where I could find them for sure but couldn't get over there before dinner), so I just left htem out, and the flavor was still very good. Thanks so much for posting."
82616,63426,11/20/2006,5,"I made this up for Thanksgiving gifts. What a wonderful treat. Great mixture of sweet and salty, and I love the sympbolism of each item. This truly is a great ""gift"". Thanks"
125388,63426,11/25/2006,5,"Wonderful idea for Thanksgiving!  I made these in Wilton plastic disposable decorating bags (to resemble a cornucopia).  I printed the blessing on the computer and stapled it to the top of each bag.  I placed one on the top of each plate on the Thanksgiving table.  We read this blessing as our prayer before dinner.  Everyone young and old alike, loved it!  I made 12 of these, and added each ingredient individually to the bags to make sure each bag got some of each ingredient."
35488,63426,11/27/2008,5,"Thanks, NovaLee - I was having a hard Thanksgiving today, and came across this recipe.  Will make and give it with thanks for many Thanksgivings to come!"
262312,102025,6/15/2009,5,"these were great!!  love finding new meatball recipes!  made as written but added garlic powder, parmesan cheese and used heavy cream instead of milk.  oh, and i added an egg. made up ahead of time and had chilling in fridge til i was ready for them.  thanks for a great meatball recipe!  will add to my keeper collection!"
4470,115534,4/26/2006,4, Lovely flavor - I enjoy Adobo spice. Instead of scallions I used 1/4 sweet onion (just for flavor).  I found it a bit dry so I added 2 tbsp Ketjap Benteng (An Indonisian sauce) I like my peppers  crisp so added them for the last 5 min only . Instead of regular noodles I used Whole Wheat. Delicious dinner thanks Chef Christine
107135,116953,4/14/2005,5,this is a nice recipe to have if you make alot of muffins like i do  i love your muffin recipes dee
209441,116953,5/12/2005,5,"What a fantastic mix! I made up a recipe of this and stuck it in my freezer to use for recipes like muffins and cakes, brilliant idea KITTENCAL! and really great streusel too!"
52543,116953,5/12/2005,5,"I usually have a batch of Healthy Bran Muffin mix (#114718) in my fridge; I now have a batch of your streusel mix in my freezer. These 2 mixes will be perfect mates for a quick, easy, tasty breakfast or snack. As usual, I used pecans instead of yucky walnuts. Thanx Kitten!"
235751,116953,8/28/2005,5,"What a great idea and recipe! It would be a real time-saver when making muffins, coffee cakes, sweet potato casseroles, etc.  Thanks so much for posting - you've done it again, Kittencal."
86318,158118,3/23/2013,5,"These noodles are wonderful! I did halve the recipe, and used snow pea shoots instead of gai lan. I also used shimeji mushrooms for oyster mushrooms, and dried rice noodles instead of fresh. The recipe doesn&#039;t list chicken stock in the ingredients, although it is in the directions. I used 1 3/4 cup stock for my half batch (though more might be better). It took longer than I expected for the dried noodles to cook, so I ended up cooking them separately, and putting the sauce over them in the bowl. Also, I don&#039;t know so much about cooking with black beans. I soaked mine in hot water, and then chopped them before adding them to the pan. It didn&#039;t seem to hurt. Thank you very very much for this delicious recipe."
397462,195977,9/25/2008,5,"I made this a few days ago, it is one of the quickest dessert recipes I' ve found. My son who is my food critic loves this and has asked me to make another one. I made no changes but next time I won't bake it quite as long."
328099,195977,10/5/2008,5,"Have had several gooey butter cakes while visiting our kids in St. Louis.  When I found this recipe, I was really excited--made it this past weekend when the St. Louis family was home--what a fabulous treat.  This will be made for many occasions in the future.  Thank you,"
403193,195977,10/27/2008,5,WOW OMGosh !  nmlawrence Thank you We love this cake.  I have made this cake for years but in our resent move I misplaced it.  So I came to Recipe Zar.  For help to just make sure I didnâ€™t mess up.  These instructions are so well written and I think that the one thing that I never did is the secret trick to Perfect Ooie Gooie Butter Cake and that is melting the butter.  Thank you for posting and making my Gooie Gooieâ€™er  and my Butter Cake better.  Lori
61995,195977,10/28/2008,5,"I have been making this for more than 10 years!  Mine is called ""Neiman Marcus butter cake, since it is so rich!  I use a 13 x 9 x 2 inch glass pan and have never had it spill over!  You can easily chance the flavor by changing the type of cake mix and extract!  I remember someone changing hers to Lemon and it went over very well!  I love it at room temp or slightly warm!  And cut it in tiny pieces!  People can take more than one!  I usually leave it in the pan and let people cut it themselves!  This is one of my top favorite recipes!"
440735,195977,12/25/2009,5,I am from St. Louis and have grown up on Gooey Butter Cakes! This has got to be one of the best recipes for this.  I think the vanilla is the magic to it. This is a very sweet cake. I only put 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar. Next time I will only use three.  I did use a 9x13 and placed it on a cookie sheet. It took much longer to cook as I expected but wanted to try it.  I took it out when it was golden brown.  I would agree with letting it completely cool.  Enjoy!
633027,195977,12/29/2009,5,"My husband and I lived in (and loved) St. Louis for several years before moving to central Texas.  The food is one of the things we miss most about STL.  My husband decided he wanted to make gooey butter cake for our Christmas dessert, and since he couldn't find the recipe he's used in the past, he chose this one to try.  He followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly!  It's very sweet, melt-in-your-mouth gooey, and certainly addictive.  The directions were very clear and detailed.  Bake time for our oven was 40 minutes; we served it at room temperature.  We look forward to making it again soon.  Thank you SO much for posting this St. Louis treat!!!!"
543968,195977,4/21/2010,5,"WOW!!! This is so very very very good!
Very easy to make.  
I actually forgot to put in the vanilla or almond flavoring. 
It didn't matter!
It was scrumptious.
I made it to take to our church Bible Study, as we eat afterwards.
Well, we made the mistake of trying it first, to see what an ""ooey gooey butter cake"" would taste like!
We then considered keeping it for ourselves, and buying something on the way, instead of taking it! LOL.
But I am going to take it.
And I know right now, there won't be any left! It just couldn't be better. Thank you!"
2100189,195977,12/12/2011,5,"This is the same recipe that I used in St. Louis about 35 years ago, at age 10. :-) I am from Affton/Kirkwood/Glendale area & now reside in SE Florida. I lost my recipe & am thankful that you posted. Today I made small tartlets with this recipe & put almond filling & cherry pie filling in the bottom, spooned the cheese mix over the top & added sliced almonds. Baking time is about 20 minutes or so, depending on your oven. I also used Mexican vanilla. It is a great vanilla for baking use. The aluminum cupcake cups with the wax paper liners work great for sharing, once the tartlet is removed from the tartlet pans. I topped off with powdered sugar. The ladies @ the Cookie Exchange party I made them for were all a buzz with curiousity & they went like lightning. This is an excellent recipe and is really easy to make."
1701315,195977,3/25/2012,5,"I grew up in Southern MO, but we often drove up to STL and would get fed Gooey Butter Cakes by our hosts.  I have tried far more complicated and time consuming recipes for them, and this easiest of versions has to take the cake...pun intended.  Wonderfully sweet and gooey with that most amazing phenomenon one calls a sugar crust.  Thanks for bringing back fond childhood memories!"
1351584,195977,7/2/2012,5,"Delicious! But kinda on the sweet side. Instead of 4 cups confectioners sugar, I just put 2. Still tastes great. Just less sweeter. My kids love it"
7248862,195977,12/5/2013,5,THIS recipe was the reason I joined this site! I too am from St. Louis and this recipe (as is) takes me back home. Will try other variations...15 STARS...GREAT recipe
2001338551,195977,4/4/2017,0,Have made this cake often. Have added 1 1/2 c of mashed sweet potatoes to filling mixture with tsp of cinnamon. Changes flavor totally.
492343,234171,12/13/2007,5,Yummy
1802406495,195977,1/25/2014,0,"To everyone reading this. There is no such thing as St Louis Gooey Buttercake. Buttercake or Philadelphia Buttercake as we know, was brought here by the Germans bakers, that came over here. ButterKuchen came from Germany. Many of the German people that settled in and around Philadelphia were great bakers, butchers and candy makers amongst other thing. If you want Buttercake, it exists only around Philadelphia in its true and original form. It started where many of the German immigrants came to live &quot;PHILADELPHIA.&quot;"
1338623,195977,2/4/2014,5,"Gooey Butter Cake is my husbands favorite and since we moved away from St. Louis, he has been craving it. So being the good wife I am, I searched for a recipe, found this one and made it for him. He LOVED it! Super easy to make and since he loved it, saving the recipe to make again and again :)"
91584,195977,3/31/2014,5,Super wonderful recipe! Yum Yum Yum  :)
2000405375,195977,8/15/2015,4,"I followed the (easy) recipe exactly, and it came out real yummy, but I was afraid I&#039;d done something wrong, because it really didn&#039;t rise much at all. It only came up about half way in a 2 inch pan. In comparing to other recipes, I found that other than adding a cup of chocolate chips and a half cup of butter to the topping, &quot;Paula Dean&#039;s Ooey Gooey Chocolate Chip Cake&quot;  is identical, and specifies a 9x13x2 pan. It&#039;s really a cookie dough, which shouldn&#039;t rise much. Omit the needless warning, and I&#039;d give it 5 stars."
2000488445,195977,9/21/2015,4,Wow! This turned out perfectly!! My husband&#039;s been asking me to make a gooey butter cake for a while now and this was wonderful!! We&#039;re from the St Louis area and I try different bakery versions all the time! 2 thumbs up from this household! :)
2000780659,195977,12/27/2015,5,Whoever invented this recipe is a genius. My boyfriend is from Texas and grew up eating this stuff. He talks about it all the time so I made a batch on Christmas. He said it was the best gooey butter cake he&#039;s had. Recipe is super simple and easy to follow.
571722,195977,1/9/2017,1,"This was incredibly sweet, and I reduced the sugar content to 3 cups. I agree it is easy, but if there's a next time I would make it in it's original scratch made recipe, the box cake (though it was a healthier, non-gmo, etc) was just as bad."
2001403242,195977,2/23/2017,0,"I really love St, Louis Gooey Butter cake, but I can only get it when I get to the city. I would love to be able to get it in my hometown. Where is that you ask? Farmington, Missouri it's about 80 miles south of St. Louis. I don't get to travel there but once every 3 to 4 yrs. To go to the hospital for test."
2001719206,195977,9/18/2017,1,This was really terrible. It was overwhelmingly sweet and I used 3 cups of the confectioners instead of 4. And the cake mixture was bizzare. It was grainy and weird. I made it because I happened to have all the ingredients on hand but I wouldn't make again.
803102,195977,10/25/2017,0,"this is the same recipe my mom used 45 years ago, now my husband's co-workers ask him to bring it for the staff pot lucks, you can use other cake mixes to chocolate, spice/add pumpkin to filling and pumpkin spice (that one is my favorite )"
2001782909,195977,11/7/2017,5,"This was so so delicious! Our family enjoyed it so much and was gone in one day! It taste better then gooey butter cake in St. Louis where I live! It was not overly sweet and wasn't to gooey or to overdone! I would recommend refrigerating it, and you HAVE to let it cool!! For ours we had to cook it for about 20-30 minutes longer but, overall this was The Best Gooey Butter Cake that I have ever had!!"
2001861106,195977,12/16/2017,5,"I first learned about gooey cake over 30 years ago while living in Florida. We took a batch with us up to our friends' cabin in the woods. They loved it! When they heard some more of our friends arriving they hid the remaining cake in their chest of drawers so they didn't have to share it! I'll be preparing five cakes this weekend to share with our neighbors. Thirty years is a long time to remember anything, so thank you for the recipe! I'm giving it five stars in advance cause I know it will be awesome!"
2002100759,195977,4/8/2018,1,"I am from Missouri and lived here most of my life and never heard of this until about 3 years ago when I found them for sale in the Deep South. I thought they were of Southern origin. It is correct to claim this as a St. Louis dessert, but saying it represents the entire State of Missouri is pushing it."
43222046,195977,4/10/2018,5,It’s a pretty close. But the 4 cups of powdered sugar was way too sweet for my taste. Next time I’ll leave it at 2 cups and add a bit of lemon juice to the cream cheese filling.
2000551249,195977,7/11/2018,5,We have substituted a lemon cake mix for the yellow cake mix and it is absolutely amazing. This is a go-to recipe to bring a dish parties and bbq's.
2002265401,195977,9/3/2018,2,I will start by saying that I followed the recipe to a T and I’ Sure it came out as expected but baby..... I felt the diabetes coming on after each bite. It tasted great but was just way too sweet. My 9 year old who could eat a bowl of sugar if I allowed it even said it was a “little” too sweet. I honestly would cut the powdered sugar measurement in half. Unfortunately I just dumped the entire lot of what was left after four family members had one serving each. Wow this is sweet.
2001205226,195977,11/3/2018,5,"This is an exceptionally tasty cake! Very sweet, yes - just take a smaller serving. I am a chocoholic, and rarely care for sweets that are not chocolate. This cake is an exception - it is utterly delicious! You will not fully realize this unless you try it!"
450004,241335,9/23/2008,4,"We really enjoyed this! We served it with Greek salad, and icy cold Retsina, from Corinthia! We were going to give it a 5, but thought maybe the sauce could be a little thicker. I will make double the amount of roux next time.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing it! [Made for Fall 08 PAC]"
73746,273416,4/12/2010,5,"I have made these several times now and they are fabulous. This time I ran out of muffin cases so I made a dozen muffins and a cake and both came out lovely

Definately a 5* recipe"
461897,300405,3/1/2009,5,"The best corn muffins ever! Very soft and sweet. The only thing I added was a touch of honey! I always double the recipe and the muffins fly off the table! Very very good corn muffin, tender and moist!"
242006,300405,8/20/2009,5,"Last night I made cornbread using the recipe on the back of the box.  They changed it, because it was not this recipe.  The new recipe on the box sucks!  Don't make it, make this one!  Trust me, this recipe right here, is the ONLY recipe you'll ever need."
122877,300405,10/13/2009,4,Insomnia struck so I made these this morning.  Simple and quite tasty.  I did add about 2 tbl of honey for a little extra sweetness.
362590,300405,12/2/2009,4,Good recipe. Made them with 1 cup flour and 1 cup cornmeal and added 1/2 cup of raspberries.
250835,300405,1/9/2010,5,"This is awesome stuff!  I used this recipe to make cornbread instead of muffins. Soft, moist and sweet.  Just an FYI due to a previous review: There are two cornbread recipes on the Albers box. One is for regular cornbread and one is for sweet cornbread or muffins. I've made both and THIS recipe is the way to go!  :-)"
857489,300405,2/3/2010,5,"This is the only recipe I've ever used for cornbread. I used to make the Marie Callendar's mix, but not ever again once I tried this! It is awesome, so moist and sweet, like cake. I hate dry, crumbly, tasteless cornbread. I always use the square pan option, I haven't tried the muffins. I highly recommend using the albers cornmeal and this recipe!"
394077,300405,3/21/2011,5,"My goodness these are so good!  I used buttermilk and they are buttery, moist, tender and perfectly sweeten.  I used Alber corn meal as suggested.  Keeper recipe.  Wow."
1879548,300405,5/29/2011,5,"I made the flour and corn meal both 1 cup and soaked my corn meal in the milk first.<br/>I also baked them in a whoopie pie or popover pan for my son - he eats them like the Thomas' toaster cakes, they freeze amazingly well."
1056692,300405,8/25/2011,5,"This is my favorite corn bread recipe!  I'm so glad to find it here already.  I actually had to dig my cornmeal box out of the recycling after moving years ago and cut this recipe off the side because no stores around me carried Albers and other brands didn't have this sweeter recipe on them.  I always put a touch of oil or shortening in my 10 inch cast iron skillet and heat it smoking hot while I mix this up so that it sizzles and crisps the outside of the bread when I pour it in, then I put it in the oven.  Great recipe for sweet cornbread."
269198,300405,9/30/2011,5,These are wonderfully tender and sweet! I will never buy Jiffy Mix again because these are so much better. I served them with beans and we will have the leftovers for breakfast.
2000201349,300405,5/13/2015,5,I cut this recipe off the Albers corn meal box years and years ago.  This has been my one and only recipe for almost 40 years.  My sons friends always wanted me to make them when they came out to the farm.  I get more compliments on these then on any other baking.
131126,388283,11/6/2012,5,"Spicy, easy, and good!  I served on a TV night with a tray of oven baked chicken fingers, celery sticks, strips of red peppers, baby carrots, bread sticks, and boiled red potato slices.  It made for nice finger food, literally took minutes to assemble, and satisfied my blue cheese & spicy craving. Thank you for sharing the recipe!  Made for Fall 2012 Pick A Chef."
364211,435357,10/21/2012,5,This does have a nice fresh taste.  I used cracker crumbs on the eggplant slices.  Thanks for posting Chef Curt.  Made for Fall PAC 2012.
2000431901,435357,2/26/2016,4,Nice and easy. I used one big grocery store eggplant. Didn&#039;t soak it overnight and thought it was still tender enough. Added chopped fresh parsley after cooking.
1950221,437309,7/6/2011,5,"Good recipe.  Great crumb and taste.  I halved the recipe which made some measurements difficult, but ended up with 1/4 c. coconut oil, 1/4 t. nutmeg and 2 eggs.  I also used almond milk.  DH liked, so will make again.  Might add some brown sugar for richness next time."
1759365,437309,7/26/2012,4,"I gave this recipe four stars only because i like my muffins just a bit sweeter.  i think i will try it with a little honey or sugar.  other than that, they are light and airy and most of all i used up some of my fresh zucchini out of my garden.  Yum yum!!  i put half in the frig and half in the freezer and my daughter who doesn't have to be glueten free loves them and the fact they are so low in calories.  she sneaks one out of frig or freezer every time she comes over.  so give it a try, if you like it just a tad sweet, then add a little sweetness of some kind.  i will definitely make this recipe again.  thanks"
229448,23259,3/5/2007,4,"This recipe was delightful! Very old world tasting, my husband refused to believe that apples and onion went together but this proved him wrong."
249623,25749,6/14/2009,0,Sounds marvelous!!! I wish I could try this. Maybe after a few more pounds!
313120,135021,9/2/2006,5,Very Good Soup.  Thanks.
158086,135021,5/7/2010,5,This was a very good fast soup...I did not put any ground beef in it and I did not have any tomato juice so I used tomato sauce and watered it down...turned out great...
2060185,135021,11/10/2011,0,I used this recipe to clean use up some foods I had in the freezer. It was great and quite simple. It was very hearty and everyone enjoyed it much!
445492,184649,5/13/2007,5,Great recipe - amazing flavor.  Easy to make too!
89831,225171,5/29/2007,5,"These were buttery rich delicious! I made these in a 13 x 9-inch pan and they baked out well, thank you for sharing Diana!...Kitten:)"
352538,225171,12/1/2010,5,"Love, love these.  The rice flour gives such a nice texture.  Thanks for posting."
222564,225171,12/23/2012,5,"Good, solid basic recipe. Turns out just like on the picture."
39301,44235,9/15/2009,5,This was a huge hit with both of my kids.  Thanks for posting!
726344,281529,1/25/2008,4,Have made these many times  very good
320640,245936,2/26/2010,5,"Delicious! I was trying to cut back the recipe a little, but ended up just making the whole thing. So my bf and I have been eating it all week. But, hey, we sure don't mind. I didn't know what kind of onion or potato to use, so I just kept it common. I used small red onions and regular Russett, but I think you could get away with a smaller potatoes too. Serving 6 - so this makes a lot. Very tasty, thank you! Chnang na! heeehee"
134011,245936,3/19/2011,5,Absolute comfort food!  Really yummy.  It also makes lots of sauce & was wonderful over rice & veg.  I also used 1/2 chilli powder due to younger family and it was nicely warm for our tastes.  Great recipe!  This is the last of 3 made for PAC 2011
280271,250609,4/5/2008,5,"I have to give this a 5 star. I don't care for Quinoa. DH love this stuff. I prepared this for him today and took a taste like I always do...and thought ooh this is good. You can taste all the flavors, but the mint is most dominate without being overpowering. If there is a recipe that will make me a Quinoa lover this is it.... Made for PAC spring 08"""
351321,250609,7/21/2012,5,"Love this recipe!!  This is the only recipe I use to make quinoa.  I omit the onions, because my husband is allergic.  So I usually add onion powder to make up for the flavor.  I always add more cranberries than the recipe says - just because I think they are delicious."
29782,256397,11/5/2007,5,I absolutely LOVED this!! I almost ate the whole thing at dinner by myself :)  YUM! this is one I know I will make many of times. Thank you so much for sharing!
278639,281620,2/4/2008,5,"I have made salmon patties from many different recipes, looking for one that I really liked, and THIS IS IT!!  It is my favorite, and so simple.  The saltines are what makes a great improvement in taste over other recipes.  Thanks, Cheri, for posting a winner (and so simple)"
693345,281620,9/17/2008,5,"This is a great recipe! I have never made salmon patties before, and I am so glad I chose this recipe! I did add a few things, however. I added a shake of dried parsley leaves from one of the big honkin' containers, which probably equated to about 2 Tablespoons. I also added a couple shakes of paprika, for a little bit of spice (maybe about 1 tsp., or a little less). I also added a shake of garlic powder from the same type of honkin' container (probably about 1 tsp. or so). I don't really measure spices for stuff like this.... I dumped most of the salmon juice (eww...salmon juice) out, but I saved about a tablespoon and put it back in the mixture, just for a tad more moistness. I used canola oil to fry, and I rolled the patties in balls a little bigger than golf balls, then pressed them to about 3/4"" thick. Cooking time was right-on. My husband really liked them, and I did too. Thanks for the wonderful recipe! :)"
268741,290180,3/19/2012,4,These turned out ok - you must SUPER FINELY CHOP the walnuts or the egg just kid of settled on the bottom- would have been good to have that in the instruction - but the taste seemed right for Persian sweets and I will try again next weekend for a Nowruz Celebration - Thank you for the recipe!
1480551,290180,3/23/2016,5,"Lovely cookie. Enjoyed by all. Agree with previous reviewer. The walnuts must be chopped very finely. I didn&#039;t have the problem of the egg yolks settling to the bottom, but I think from a texture stand-point more finely chopped walnuts is better."
645231,336795,11/28/2008,5,"I made this the other night for dinner and it was fantastic!  I serve it with garden salads and nothing else and it was plenty filling.  The only change I made was using extra cheese (wanted to use up the rest of the block I had), therefore I had to add 2 extra eggs.  I changed nothing else and it came out beautifully!  We love quiche in our house and now we have a new recipe for life.  Thanks Trinkets!"
200862,336795,11/5/2011,5,"Trinkets, I apologise for having had to use zucchini instead of spinach -- our only decent shop had neither fresh nor frozen! I liked your recipe for its simplicity and creaminess!! Didn't change anything else (I used 1 cup cream and 1/2 cup milk). I hope 5 stars show up, because the new format and colours have me confused! This quiche is soft and creamy, and quite delicious. Next time I WILL do it with spinach. Thanks!!"
2001848839,336795,12/10/2017,0,"Five stars for sure! Awesome! Substituted unsweetened almond milk, vanilla flavored, instead of regular milk. You have to try this! Was so moist and best flavor I have tasted. Great recipe! Thanks!"
107583,373842,12/5/2009,5,"Delicious quiche!  I didn't use a frozen crust, but did use a ready-made one.  I also made this a bit ""quicker"" by using pre-cooked crumbled bacon.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg, because it is a flavor I like in quiche.  Thanks for a quick, tasty dinner!"
2149976,73513,1/16/2012,5,Great summer garden salad !!
487088,373842,2/3/2013,5,"Lots of awesome goodness! So easy. I liked Mikekey's idea of using pre-cooked bacon and that did save some time. I always have that on hand. I'll absolutely make this again and next time I plan to thrown in some chopped spinach, I can also see using ham and cheddar cheese with some broccoli. So many possibilities."
461834,373842,9/22/2013,5,"Wonderful quiche!!  I made 1/3 of the recipe and used a recipe from my &quot;Small Batch Baking&quot; cookbook for the pie crust which made one mini pie/quiche to serve two.  I served it with some fresh fruit and blueberry muffins, yummy brunch!!  Made for your win in the football pool game, congrats again!!"
176615,373842,7/2/2014,5,Good simple to fix quiche. Made my own pie crust and cooked the bacon in the oven. Next time I may use green onions rather than saut&eacute;ed onion. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
2000688819,373842,11/17/2015,5,"FANTASTIC!!!! I tweaked it a wee bit:  sauteed onions, mushrooms and spinach.  Then added this to the egg mixture.  Also used bacon chips - which is soy bacon bits.  ABSOLUTELY DIVINE.........."
615758,373842,6/24/2018,5,"Made this for dinner last night and had it for breakfast too!! It is very good and easy to make. I had a frozen pie crust, made up the bacon and onion as directed, but I didn't have half and half so I just used 2% milk and it came out fine. I did throw in some cheddar and jack that I had in addition to the swiss and also some chopped spinach. It turned out terrific!! I would recommend to anyone."
655199,381108,7/15/2009,3,"This was pretty good, but could've used a little more seasoning IMO...couldn't really taste the Worcestershire sauce. Granddaughter's (7 & 3) loved it! Will make it again, but will add some seasonings. THANKS!"
86318,30968,9/11/2003,5,"This is a lovely recipe for hot weather. I cut it back to 1/2 pound tomatoes, which came to about 2 medium ones. It's such a simple recipe, but I don't think I would have thought to do it myself, and now that I've made it, I can think about adding other things...like olives or even anchovies. Thank you, Pat "
121690,30968,8/1/2004,5,"Great recipe during the summer tomato-growing season, and wonderful for somebody like me who is avoiding salt. With all the herbs you don't miss it.  I used your recipe as a base, substituting fresh for dried basil, then added in sauteed mushrooms and zucchini and ate it over fettucini.  I'll definitely make it again!"
40114,30968,8/5/2006,5,"This really is a lovely recipe. I don't easily give a five-star rating, bit thos one deserves it. Don't hesitate to use more tomatoes if you are a tomato-lover (like I am)."
1198738,30968,8/7/2010,4,"DH really liked this.  I thought it was just okay.  However, when there is a plethora of fresh tomatos in the kitchen, this is an excellent way to use them.  Hubby even ate the leftovers cold out of the fridge, and he may have even lickied the bowl!"
362734,44235,5/17/2007,5,This was a really fun snack mix. My kids enjoyed it and it kept them busy on a long car ride. This will be great for our hiking trips as there is no chocolate to melt. I used blueberry yogurt cheerios and chocolate teddy grahams.Thanks for this recipe!
285039,44235,4/26/2008,5,"What a cute concept!  Never would I have thought of making trail mix with animal cookies and teddy grahams!  I, too, used chocolate Teddy Grahams but used chocolate skittles instead of fruit snacks and peanuts instead of raisins.  Kids love it! Thanks!"
369975,44235,8/21/2008,5,A very popular recipe for a office party.  I also used chocolate Teddy Grahams and different character shaped fruit snacks.  Everyone was shocked that it was so good and so easy to make.  I will be serving this again the future.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!
326787,44235,12/22/2008,4,"Mixed up for a Christmas snack gift for my mother and father, something that sounded not too sweet. I did use the frosted Cherrios and chocolate Teddy Grahams as suggested. This sounded like a good choice, and I think it will be. Thanks..."
85707,44235,9/11/2009,5,Easy and so cute!  We are having a family birthday party and there will be several little ones attending.  I made up a batch and tested it on my 2 1/2 year old grand daughter and 18 year old daughter.  They both loved it.
38643,44235,9/13/2009,5,My grandkids had fun making and eating this today!
143917,44235,10/30/2009,5,This is addictive!! I made it for DD to take on a road trip where it lasted about 20 minutes.  Sent some in a care package to DS with the same results.  Doubled the recipe but next time will have to quadruple!!! Thanks for a sweeeeeeet recipe!
103876,44235,7/27/2010,5,"I pulled this up in a hurry today to make a relatively healthy snack-mix for our upcoming vacation.  We used chocolate animal crackers, pretzels, honey roasted peanuts, cheerios, raisins and fruit snacks.  It is very addictive!  Thanks for posting."
29418,44235,2/2/2011,5,"I was searching on a snack mix that would be relatively healthy and fun for my three year old as she was getting tired of the same 'ole stuff... So I used chocolate animal crackers, pretzels, honey graham bears, honey nut cheerios, raisins and smiley fruit snacks...  It's very good...I love it and she seems to as well...Thanks for sharing!"
394543,57562,12/31/2006,3,"I liked these but they don't rise 
much more than a couple inches
Atleast mine did not."
215969,97183,2/6/2006,5,"I've made this twice now. Got it just right the second time. The recipe doesn't specify where to add the tomatoes, so I put them in with the zucchini and other vegies for frying. I found 1 medium to large eggplant and 1 zucchini is about right. The eggplant I diced and sprayed with oil and then microwaved for 4-5 minutes. The vegies I just fried with a bit more spray. The first time I made it I didn't remove enough of the tomato fluid and it came out a bit soggy. The second time I used phyllo pastry and made individual large serve pies. Rave reviews. Thanks so much for the recipe - this is definitely a keeper!."
234075,97183,6/21/2008,5,"This was excellent. I microwaved the eggplant, like Andrea-Oz did, and used much less oil overall. Since I had fresh basil on hand, I used that instead of dried. And I had grape tomatoes, so I threw those in. I also used about 2/3 of the amount of cheese, to keep the fat and calories down. 
Finally, I used the Greek Baking Powder Pie Crust, Recipe #146530 , to keep it healthy. Awesome. Will make again. Thank you for posting."
2001782143,97183,11/7/2017,5,This exact recipe came from a Betty Crocker Book from the 1970's. I could not find myt book so I checked the web. So happy to find it here. No tweaks necessary. It is perfect.
148715,152122,12/30/2006,5,We did a large dinner party for my daughters 17th birthday.  Our theme was Greek and this dip fit the bill.  I shredded the cucumber and squeezed it so it wouldn't make the dip runny.  The dip was a hit and will get made next time I need to do a greek party.
953275,152122,7/11/2009,5,"This just goes to show you sometimes DO need a recipe for the simplest of things!!  :)  Thanks Brew, this turned out really well.  I used balkan style (thick) yogurt and still drained it for the day in the fridge.  I also followed your instructions and seeded & chopped as opposed to grating/squeezing like I normally do.  It's really pretty perfect!  Thanks, won't go back now."
1206102,152122,2/25/2010,5,"Delicious.  I did have real Greek yogurt, but no dill, so I minced some fresh mint (about 2 T).  Great with baby carrots!"
338384,152122,8/15/2011,5,"I just noticed that I never rated this recipe and I must make this at least twice a month!  Seriously, I love this dip, especially with pita bread.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us!"
150281,163370,10/12/2007,5,"FANTASTIC! I saved this for a special occation and it was a great hit. This is a great recipe for the autumn. My husband loves these, that is a high review in this house. I think this is a recipe that we will be keeping and using again!
Thank you for posting!!
PAC-Fall07"
803717,163370,3/31/2008,5,I made these for a sunday special at the restaurant I work at. they are spectacular! I modified it slightly by making my own tapioca pudding (cheaper when you need to make a large quantity) and I substituted carmel extract for the brandy. they were served warm with sauteed granny smith apples on top and drizzled with a homemade carmel sauce....rave reviews from all of my customers!!! thank you so much for the recipe. I will definetely make these again!!!
269521,205218,9/3/2009,5,"So simple and very tasty!   I cut the recipe done for two. Instead of canned green chilies, I substitued roasted poblano (diced) and used left over fresh sweet corn!  Also added left over diced chicken to mine (DH doesn't do chicken).  My process was  a little different;  I toasted one side of the tortillas on the griddle, flipped over; then added the filling and folded.  Served with fresh salsa.  YUM!    Thanks for sharing!"
246482,217012,7/4/2018,4,Very nice I got 18 muffins out of it but I think my tins were smaller. Next time ill add a bit more coconut or sprinkle a bit on the tops before baking Made for world tour 2018 for the Pantry Pirates.
1145795,229942,1/26/2009,5,"For my project on Ethiopia in world history, I chose to make the national dish.  The original recipe I chose called for teff flour but unfortunately I couldn't find it anywhere. 

Although I have never eaten authentic injera before, these pancakes came out nice and spongy and delicious!  Plus, the recipe was extremely easy!

5 stars! :)"
1110776,78274,5/15/2014,5,Love it!
213139,378032,7/19/2009,5,"Made for New Kid on the Block Tag.  These chicken thighs are out of this world.  I originally thought that they would be rather spicy, but they weren't.  Love the color that the cumin put on the meat and you could really taste it.  The only two things about this recipe are ~ the ingredients are not in the order that they are used (might be confusing for a new cook and thus I forgot the cilantro) and the sauce needed to be thickened a little, which I did.  Regardless this is a great recipe and I will use it again!  Thanks for posting this!"
829250,378032,7/23/2014,4,"Made this because it looked quick! It was good!!! Didn&#039;t blow me away or anything. Thinking maybe tomorrow it will be better after all the flavors blend. There was a lot of liquid. Tried to add some corn starch to thicken it up but it didn&#039;t do much. Made with a side of beans and sauted red potatoe, zucchini, and carrots. Added sliced avacado too."
1170714,241799,6/20/2011,5,This is excellent.  I cut the recipe in half and still had more than enough for what I needed.  I also used more powdered sugar than called for because I wanted a thick filling that wouldn't bulge between the layers.  I could eat it with a spoon it's soooo good!
1333844,241799,2/26/2012,5,"I tried this filling and it was really good. I made a 1/4 sized recipe to try it and it was a lot, but was it good!? I followed it to the T and it turned out great. Will post pics soon."
63858,260554,10/24/2007,5,"This was awesome!  We loved it.  Will definately make again.  The only change I made was I used dried cilantro instead of fresh.  Thanks made for PAC Fall 07.
Lisa"
128541,260554,11/21/2010,5,This soup is absolutely the yummiest soup I've had!  So much flavor and so quick!  Thanks for posting it here!
133174,260554,11/19/2017,5,A perfect soup for a cool autumn evening. I used rotisserie chicken breast meat and the soup was ready on the table is less than 30 minutes. It is well seasoned and something I am sure to make again.
865936,278119,6/12/2010,5,"I made this into individual meatloaves and they were terrific!  I love Mediterranean ingredients.  I always think I don't like mint (in any form), but actually I do!  Thanks for posting.  This will certainly be made again."
1803719199,278119,1/28/2015,5,This is my favorite meatloaf. We started buying half a lamb every year. I wasn&#039;t sure what to do with the ground lamb. So off I went to search out yummy things to make. I have made this several times now and it always is a delight for those I share it with. Super easy but oh so tasty. Thank you for sharing this.
2002330544,278119,11/13/2018,4,"This is the best meatloaf I have ever made, Moist, flavorful, everyone loved it. Not 5 star because I am just conservative like that."
1235950,285168,4/12/2009,3,"I followed the recipe as listed. Full of flavor. The eggs cooked evenly. I laid the steamer bag flat. The texture was spongy throughout and soggy on the bottom. Convenient way of cooking eggs, but I rather use a pan. Thanks."
592157,299530,3/3/2010,5,This was simple to make and had a very nice flavor.
1600888,299530,4/19/2010,5,Love this soup!  It's so easy to make and is very authentic!  Thank you!
766849,299530,8/1/2010,5,"Yum!!!  I think this is the same soup my Korean friend used to order for me (she and the people at the restaurant spoke so quickly I couldn't follow any of it)... it came in individual bowls and we cracked a raw egg into our boiling bowls of soup... a great addition, in my book.  Thanks for posting!"
812019,317541,1/25/2009,4,I picked this recipe from Recipezaar at the same time my wife picked it from BH&G. We make it with Chicken tenderloins and serve over rice.
136997,328012,1/9/2009,5,"I love caremilzed onions, so I had to try this. Didn't change a thing. Delicious! :)"
160977,328012,7/1/2009,5,"This is so good! There were two things that I did not have on hand. Fresh thyme and tomatoes. Solution: used 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme and 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes from a can. Worked perfectly. When the jam was ready it seemed a bit ""wet"", I decided to leave most of the liquid in the pan and scrape the jam together. Wanted to taste it as soon as it was done and found it a bit too sweet. But-once cooled (actually the day after) it was not overly sweet at all, had a jam-like consistency and a zing from the red pepper flakes. A little of this onion jam on a cheese sandwich, mmmmmmmmm.  It has many more uses but I keep putting it on my sandwich, can't stay away from it. Yes, indeed delicious. Thanks for posting."
601528,328012,2/19/2010,5,I reduced the recipe by 1/3 with great success.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to chop up the onions instead of slicing.  It was a bit difficult to eat for me.  I thought this was delicious and went well with my tomato and balsamic vinegar chicken that I made for dinner last night.  I slathered this on some homemade rolls.
318262,328012,9/18/2011,5,This was delicious! I didn't end up canning or storing any because we wanted to eat it all right away (I scaled the recipe down). I also added a tad more balsamic since I love the stuff and cut down a bit on the sugar. Topped burgers with these lovely onions. Thanks so much for sharing!
2633368,328012,5/1/2015,5,"OMG!  This is SO good!  I didn&#039;t&#039; follow the measurements exactly, but it  was delicious!  Sweet and savory. SO good! I definitely plan to make this again! 
I didn&#039;t use tomatoes because I was all out. Maybe I will try with them next time."
323186,344072,1/12/2009,5,"My first attempt at Bhaji, and certainly not my last,  these spicy treats were very straightforward to put together and welcomed by my DH who adores spicy nibbles!

That said, they are not overly spicy, so spice-lovers might like to add chopped chillies to this.

I used Pea flour, and I did need more than 1/2 cup of water, closer to a cup, eventually, although I added a little at a time until I had a thick smooth batter.   The veggies add their own liquid, so be sure not to make your batter too runny.

I shallow-fried these, and found they cooked easily, nicely crisp but a good 'spongy'  texture inside, I really was quite impressed!

Thank you for an interesting new experience, Pat!"
585496,344072,2/6/2009,5,"Excellent recipe.  If you don't want to deep fry, sauteing also works (though it's not as tasty).

I have found baking the Bhaji, much like the technique you use for Nicoise Socca, also works well.  Mix all the ingredients and add 1/2 t. baking soda.  Put 2-4 T. oil into a non-stick frying pan, then pour in the bhaji mixture.  Bake in a hot oven (425F) for approx 20 minutes.  Serve in 'pizza' slices with a yogurt-coriander dip for an interesting appetizer."
320449,344072,5/4/2009,5,"Great flavor!  I followed the baking suggestion, but baked mine for about 30 min. (in a 10"" pan)."
542159,344072,7/16/2009,3,Really sorry we just did not like this dish. Tried baking it as recommend by other reviewers. DH liked the taste but not the texture. May be better fried as I think 75% of our issue was the texture itself.
527607,344072,10/20/2009,5,"These are fantastic! I bought besan flour at a local indian market before i knew what to do with it, but am very glad i did.  Delicious and so flavorful!"
252514,344072,9/2/2011,5,"These were very good. I loved the mix of veggies with the besan (chickpea) flour. They were not overly spicy either, although I did cut half of the chili powder and used curry powder in its place. I shallow-fried these in oil and drained them on a paper bag.  Note: this batter can be made a day a head and kept in the fridge. Served these with Recipe#326538, sauteed baby kale, yogurt, and peach chutney. It was a delicious meal! Thanks, Pat! [Made for I Recommend Tag]"
205750,344072,11/6/2018,5,Really loved these. No doubt they can be tweaked according to taste and I am looking forward to making more in the future. I found they were still a bit undercooked in the middle after I fried them but I finished them off in the oven and they were great!
220348,360603,5/13/2009,5,"This is for Zaar World Tour 5, and I am a member of the Dining Daredevils. I really love this recipe. I think the combination of nutmeg and fresh parsley is what gives this recipe a nice kick. Although I do have to say that because I love apples, it made it that much easier to enjoy this recipe."
744296,360603,5/21/2009,3,Made this for ZWT5. Interesting combination. Didn't have the parsley. This went well with meatloaf.
542159,360603,10/11/2009,5,"Tasty! How can you go wrong with cabbage, apples and butter. The nutmeg is a nice addition, how ever fond the parsley a bit distracting. We like parsley but felt that it took a way from all the other wonderful flavors. Made as written and next will do the same leaving out the parsley. Thanks so much for the post."
2324285,481622,4/8/2013,5,"I really liked this side dish.  The raisins add just the right amount of sweetness, and although I used chopped cashews instead of pine nutes, I enjoyed that addition too.  A great way to dress up swiss chard- thanks for sharing. [Made &amp; Reviewed for Spring PAC 2013]"
21694,5139,10/22/2001,5,"Very good, wonderful dinner during cold nights."
38492,5139,4/20/2002,0,"Try this recipe using lamb to make it more authentic,the first time my Grandmother made this was the time i knew this was my favorite comfort food.saute the lamb in bacon,crumble the bacon and follow the recipe.enjoy."
39426,5139,4/30/2002,5,"We agree, this was delicious! I would have added more meat and tomatoe but everyone agreed 'don't fix what isn't broken'. Even non-beet-eaters beat us to the pot for more!"
352483,5139,6/23/2008,5,"This is my second foray into borscht and have to say this is amazing.  This is easy and fantastic as it stands.  If you like, add additional beef and/or tomatoes but this is a great recipe.  I highly recommend it.  And to think I'd been downright afraid of beets.  Thank you so much!"
459426,5139,11/11/2008,4,Really tasty recipe. I added grated carrot too just to get a bit more fibre.  Thanks! :)
41578,52968,4/3/2003,5,"I loved the combination of the white cheese and Velveeta!!! This dish is so smooth and creamy.  Easy to make and everyone loved it.  Thanks so much, TinaEmJer.  I have put this in my ""keeper"" notebook.   :-)

162939,52968,9/16/2006,5,Pumpkie....This was delious. After trying several recipes for mac & cheese over the years I finially found one that we all loved. Way to go on this fantastic recipe. Thpse kiddo's are lucky to have a mom like you!!!
68460,77021,12/20/2003,4,"Good soup!  I used 8 cups of chicken stock (from my freezer stash) and 2 cups water.  For the pasta I used 8 oz. of tri-color tortellini and the rest of the recipe I did as written, using low-fat cream of chicken soup.  Makes a nice big, flavorful pot of soup, we have enough for another meal.  Thanks Darlene, good recipe!"
41578,77021,9/20/2005,5,"I have been in a soup mood lately and this certainly hit the spot!  I always have cooked chicken in the freezer and that is what I used for this delicious soup.  The ingredient ratio is perfect and I wouldn't change a thing.  You did it again, Darlene Summers.
"
75497,77021,1/8/2008,3,"I loved this, but my daughter and husband would only eat a few bites, so I'm averaging that out to three stars.  I served this alongside mini Recipe #154943.  My raviolini had cheese and spinach in them, so I skipped the broccoli.  It was a great combination of flavors and easy to prepare.  I'm looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch today!"
149342,92154,7/5/2004,3,Cook time on the broiling is a little long-- the ends of the legs got slightly burned.  Also a little more Old Bay seasoning (2Tbs) is a little tastier.  
223979,92154,1/12/2009,5,Very good!  I love soft shell crabs and always have them in the freezer.  I followed the other reviewers advice about the Old Bay seasoning.  I added a tablespoon to the flour.  They turned out great!  Thanks!
8688,121303,6/20/2005,5,"Delicious Pick-Me-Up! I made this using fresh blackberries with no changes to the recipe.  Thanks for a wonderful smoothie recipe, ocurt Schrock!"
59064,146401,1/24/2006,5,Excellent recipe and you definitely get enough to make 2 thin crusts which meant I had one for the freezer. Which makes this recipe slightly more economical that most pizza bases as most bases take 3 cups flour per base. Great taste and texture - a good reliable recipe.
176615,146401,9/27/2007,5,"Great recipe! I've tried lots of pizza doughs and this one is just wonderful. Very easy to work with. I used half for recipe #221973 and froze the other half for a pizza in the near future. Thanks for sharing your recipe! Made for PAC Fall 2007. Update: Thawed my dough and used it for pizza tonight. Excellent pizza crust! It's so incredibly easy having this ready to go, next time I'll take the chef's suggestions and make a dozen for the freezer. Second update: I made this dough again, this time doubled the recipe and used half white whole wheat flour and half unbleached flour plus a tad bit more water. Worked great for pizza tonight, and I have three dough balls in the freezer for future meals. Thanks!"
130819,146401,9/29/2007,5,This makes for a great pizza! Have a really huge pan that is almost oven size - this dough was perfect for the making of a large thick crust pizza. Added all the favorites to top and everyone was happy. I intend to prepare and have crusts in the freezer. Yes will not only be making this again but will be passing around the recipe. Thank you for sharing this pizza crust recipe that has been added to my favorites folder.
253407,146401,10/8/2007,5,"This is a very delicious pizza crust!! It was very easy to throw in the bread machine and all the ingredients are what I always have on hand. This dough is very easy to work with. I was very happy to get 2 pizza out of my dough, most pizza doughs only give you one pizza! We usually eat at least one and 1/2 pizzas and DH likes to take leftovers for his lunch! I will be making this crust again, I will have to try freezing it also. Thanks for posting a great recipe!!"
177085,146401,10/1/2008,5,"This was so good, and very easy to do. The taste was delicious and was simple for a beginner at making their own pizza dough like me! This made enough for two pizzas so I froze one for later. We eat pizza at least once a week and this is now our recipe! Thanks for a great recipe!"
383346,146401,10/25/2009,5,"DH rolled the dough and he told me it was very easy to work with.  And the crust was perfect, great taste.  Thanks FinFan :)  Made for Holiday tag"
289117,146401,2/20/2010,5,"Great crust!  I did the prebake on the pizza stone for both crusts and froze one of them.  The other I filled with sauce, cheese, pepperoni and sausage and baked it at 425 for about 14 minutes.  Dee-licious!  Thanks!"
31316,181978,8/23/2006,4,"I made this last night.  I had never had or made jambalaya before.  When I was cooking the veggies, tomato paste and 1.5 cups of water, the liquid vanished.  I improvised by adding a cup or so of chicken stock.  In the end, it tasted wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!"
1668373,207860,9/26/2010,5,"very easy to make, and much tastier than store bought.  Wonderful!!"
461834,203281,9/24/2007,5,"This is delicious and it is low fat!!!  I made one change to the directions, I cooked the onions in a couple teaspoons butter instead of dressing, as I felt the dressing would be too powerful.  I think next time I will cook the onions in the dressing, to keep to the low fat, but then leave the dressing out of the sour cream mixture.  I put the steak in the dressing in the morning to marinade and then grilled it that night.  Thank you for a great recipe nicole!!!!!  Made for PAC."
46357,203281,9/15/2008,5,"Oh, this is YUMMY! I followed recipe exactly and it was all good, but the onions sauteed in the dressing were fabulous! I may make all my sauteed onions like this from now on."
1206102,205357,12/29/2011,5,"Delicious!  The only change I made was leaving it chunky instead of pureeing, as we prefer our soups more ""stew""-like.  The flavors are subtle and seductive!"
71188,229263,6/19/2007,3,"Great recipe for leftover beef, easy to make and delicious."
171790,229263,11/5/2007,4,I made this for last night's dinner. I used Dijon mustard in place of the dry mustard and I think that next time I'll use fresh garlic. Very tasty. A great way of using up left over pot roast.
46783,235064,7/13/2007,5,"A friend from work made this and brought it for the other co-workers to try and everyone loved it!!  It has that caramel apple taste to it. Can't wait to make it for my family.

197277,235064,10/17/2007,5,Random... ingrendients.. But very yummy! I had already peeled apples for something else and was out ingredients. I had this I cut it in half. It was very good!
519838,235064,10/30/2007,5,yum!! This tastes like taffy apple! Everyone loved it and took some home! Update! I just found out that my friend also added an extra pudding box of butterscotch flavor and some milk.
180898,235064,11/3/2008,5,This got rave reviews at my Halloween party from both adults and kids. My 10 year old DD made me promise to make this for the holidays. Thanks for posting.
53368,235064,7/5/2009,5,"I've made this before and can agree that it is ZOMG FANTASTIC!  The recipe I used called for added banana slices and mandarin oranges.  Adding those could perhaps justify that it is a TAD more healthy, but of course we all know it's not.  XD  Doesn't change the fact that this is an AWESOME dessert."
1098889,235064,12/3/2009,3,I had very high expectations but this was just okay for me.
724631,298595,8/31/2008,3,"3 Stars, please see my rating system. I like all the ingredients, and I had never been let down by a TOH recipe, but this recipe as written missed the mark. I shared with my co-workers, and quite a bit was left over. I rated 3 stars because it was too bland, so I would not make it again unless I switched pepper jack cheese for the Monterey jack cheese (wouldn't most families prefer cheddar?), or switched horseradish mustard for the Dijon mustard, or served a bunch of different accompaniments, such as catsup, jalapeno slices, or cheese sauce so people could adapt it to their tastes. On the plus side, this was just the right amount of mix to fill a 13 x 9 pan (see upper left corner of my closeup photo).  A coworker took her piece home and stuffed in Pepper Jack cheese and bacon bits before reheating, and her son declared it a winner.  DH loaded on shredded parmesan cheese and reheated, and enjoyed it very much.  I conclude that one must choose some strategy to add a little zip.  Made for Photo Tag."
133174,321792,8/11/2009,4,"The recipe is definitely a perfect after work meal.  The chicken was brushed with the pesto and instead of pan cooking, it was cooked on the George Forman grill.  I had a little difficult with the couscous as I wasn't sure what a sachet was.  I purchase couscous in bulk and attempted to make 2 servings.  It was a little gummy and something I would have to play with to get right.  All in all this is a very well flavored dish that made quick work of getting dinner on the table.  Made for *Aussie Swap*"
583349,321792,6/30/2011,5,"This was great!  I loved the lemony twist added to the pesto.  I used spinach instead of arugula because the store didn't have any, but will definitely make again with the arugula.  I used only 1 cup water with 1 cup couscous since I don't know what a sachet is.  Thanks for posting!"
743849,359677,6/22/2009,5,"I liked this recipe because it is basic and was easy to adapt to my tastes.  I used 1 15 oz can of red kidney beans and 1 15 oz can of white great northern beans (I drained and rinsed both cans).  I used a yellow pepper from my garden and added a small onion to the mix.  I used spicy sausage (would have been really good with kielbasa, too).  I sprinkled some creole seasoning into the beans while they simmered.  Finally, I served them over steamed basmati rice & garnished with some fresh, chopped green onions (also from my garden).  Delicious lunch!  I GNOME I will make this again!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, kellychris!"
68960,360683,5/28/2009,5,"Awesome meal with awesome flavour!  This came together in no time at all for a filling, tasty, healthy meal.  Love the addition of the sage, rosemary and celery salt.  Mr Tender I'll put this one into our family members cookbook ;)   book #55856"
355058,360683,5/28/2009,5,"Uncle Brent, I didn't know you knew how to cook!  5 1/2 stars from me.  This was very yummy!  I LOVED the nooooodles!!!"
731434,360683,5/28/2009,5,Five stars from me!  I ate lots and lots!  I love you Uncle Brent xxx
424680,408997,10/18/2011,5,Used Gala apples for these muffins & I was very happy with the results ~ Had some wonderfully moist & flavorful gems that were shared by several neighbors! I really enjoy making these kinds of special treats & do appreciate you posting the recipe! Thanks so much! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in this fall's round of Pick A Chef]
705251,432469,9/5/2010,4,This is a nicely refreshing beverage.  The flavor is very nice and unusual.  The coffee does not overwhelm the other flavors and the drink still retains its very pink color.  It is definitely going into my saved recipes folder to try again when I have some girlfriends over.  Thanks for sharing in Newest Zaar Tag.
128473,432469,10/11/2012,5,"This was a nice coffee, so pretty.  I really enjoyed the subtle strawberry flavor.  The coffee shines thru in a subtle way.  Its rich, thick and creamy.  It was quick and really easy to make.   Thanks for sharing this lovely iced treat.  Made for Think Pink 2012"
25455,8846,1/25/2002,5,This has been one of my kid's favorite cakes for many years.
35635,8846,8/8/2002,5,"This is so good warm, love the topping..."
138799,8846,9/28/2007,5,"Moist and delicious, this cake was so easy to prepare! The only change I made was using half brown sugar and half white. The topping makes the already wonderful tasting cake even more special. Definitely a dessert to serve company! Thank you for sharing! I made this for the Cake-A-Thon in memory of Chef-I-Am."
139930,8846,9/29/2007,5,I made this cake for the Cake-A-Thon in memory of Chef-I-Am.  We loved it!  Simple to put together with items I always have on hand.  Cake was tender and moist.  Topping was perfect!  Cake and topping complimented eachother well.  This recipe is a keeper for me!
246197,8846,12/18/2007,5,"Made a vegan version of this. I used 2/3 cup applesauce instead of the eggs, margarine instead of butter and soy milk in place of the cream. 
It turned out moist and delicious!!"
583502,8846,2/9/2008,2,"this didn't work well for me :(
it was not ""moist"" it was downright soggy. the cake seemed okay when i took it out of the oven, the top and sides were dry and golden and it felt solid but when i put the topping on the margarine seeped into the cake and made it soggy, it also dripped off the top of the cake and went all over my oven. seems to be to much margarine."
2873848,8846,3/15/2014,0,Every year for my birthday my mom would ask me what kind of cake i wanted and I picked this one ever time.  Im 57 now and my mom quit making me cakes years ago but I still love this cake.  I believe the recipe is exactly the same.
1802965531,8846,9/21/2014,5,"Baked this for our church tea, only used 1/2 the sugar and used Oatmilk instead of Cream or Normal milk in the topping, It was a hit and loved by everyone, including the children."
222433,183729,11/12/2006,4,Your right! This is really good. My teen boys loved it as well. The only thing that I will do different next time will be to make a double batch!! Thanks for the recipe!
1056692,8846,10/27/2014,4,Very sweet and decadent. I might change the topping next time since my son didn&#039;t care for it. I love how moist this was without being soggy. My only change was to bake in a 9 inch round cake pan. Next time I&#039;ll try to cut back on fat by using applesauce instead of butter and maybe fiddle with the carb count for my diet. I did have some and it was worth the cheat tho. :-)
1363685,8846,12/28/2014,4,Very tasty and easy to make!  Just be sure to use a 9 x 9 pan to avoid the dripping situation one of the posters had.  Can&#039;t wait to make it again...with some healthy substitutions and additions!!
1802637236,8846,1/9/2015,0,Wonderful!  Lots of childhood memories with this fiber-billed delight.
1802849661,8846,2/2/2016,4,"I&#039;d never tried Oatmeal Cake before, but I don&#039;t know why because I am a complete oat addict; I have oatmeal every single day for breakfast and this cake was amazing! I&#039;m not a huge coconut fan, even though the topping was delicious, I preferred it without, but that&#039;s just my taste buds! It&#039;s a great recipe! :)"
1122988,8846,5/15/2016,5,Delicious and easy! Will make again!
2001184688,8846,2/19/2017,0,I have been making this cake for 50 years and my Mother before. It is a great cake.
2757264,8846,1/14/2018,0,Can I use steel cut oats with this recipe??
2002092044,8846,4/2/2018,5,This is my husband's favorite &quot;birthday cake&quot;. I got the recipe from his mother when we got married and have enjoyed making it at other times when I want something quick and sweet. It is the easiest cake I have ever made from scratch and is a crowd pleaser at the office or any other get together.
6357,33205,7/9/2002,3,"These were good. Since I like to make my cookies larger than the usual sized, this made 32 cookies for me. I did not grease my baking dish as the mixture already had enough margarine in it. I'm not too sure whether cake flour means the same as all-purpose flour ,or if the latter can be substituted for the former. But, I made this using all purpose flour and it was good. Thanks!"
227652,33205,7/11/2005,4,This has a yummy vanilla flavoring to it. The cookie is very thin & flat so be sure to drop the cookies 2 in apart so they don't run into each other. I baked mine for 18 minutes since I like my cookies a litte soft on the inside yet crisp on the outside. This made around 4 dozen for me. 
650039,33205,1/27/2008,4,Loved these! I use all purpose flour and only a dash of salt as my DH is on a low sodium diet. He loved them too. The go great with recipe #103024 Vanilla Pudding. Will surely be making these often .
1194914,33205,7/30/2009,3,"Taste good, but they didn't spread well.  I think they might come out better with butter (in place of shortening).  I used All-Purpose flour..maybe cake flour would make a difference too."
80950,43611,3/5/2004,5,I actually have to hide this from my husband when I make it.  This was easy to make if a little messy. I ended up using the Morton's Tender Quick Salt as I was unable to find a substitute.
340445,43611,9/11/2006,5,"I was skeptical as I feared I would end up with 5 little baked meatloafs.  But not so.  The Tender Quick gives it the right color and texture.  This was very, very good.  I will definitely be making this again and again.  Thank you."
408221,43611,12/15/2006,5,"I used more garlic (1 teaspoon per pound of meat) and it turned out phenomenal.  I scaled this recipe up to use 4.5# vension and 1.5 # chuck and the salt content was a bit much.  I will probably only use 4 tbsp. of Tender Quick for 7.5 servings, but it still turned out wonderful."
638020,43611,11/5/2007,4,"Loved the recipe, as did everyone who tried it. I will be making this, a lot more often. Do not let the 4 star rating fool you, as I rarely if ever , give anything a 5 star rating. Love the recipe though."
652263,43611,11/16/2007,5,"This is a very tasty recipe!
Last weekend was our first time making sausage. We used this recipe, some fibrous casings we bought off the internet, and smoked them in the BBQ for several hours and it turned out great!! It is a little salty at first but as it ages in the fridge the other flavors come though. I would recommend using a little less salt if you don't like allot of salt."
353131,43611,1/20/2008,5,"This is an excellent and very easy recipe that gives as good as Hickory Farms results! DD(7) said it was""off the hook"",DD(9) said it was great and DH loved it He wants me to make more to give to some of his friends at work!!"
375730,43611,12/1/2008,4,"This was our first attempt at Summer Sausage and it turned out great!  Ours turned out a  little crumbly but we didn't measure exactly so our ratios of meat could have been off.  We also cooked it longer because we were a little nervous at the short cook time.  We mixed everything in a ziplock baggie which worked great!  We found it difficult to get it packed tight enough and are planning to use soup cans as a mold, line them with tin foil and then bake.  Hopefully this works:)
**Note our butcher told us to spray/oil just a soup can pack the meat in and bake it-it should slip out-we are going to try that next."
983307,43611,1/23/2009,4,Very easy to make and tasty too.  I used 1 lb. of ground pork with the venison instead of the ground beef.  Thanks for sharing.
326176,43611,4/25/2010,5,"Wonderful!  We used all elk meat (no beef) and regular sea salt.  I generally 1/3 the recipe and make 2-4"" long rolls.  Everyone loves the great flavor.  I like the smoker idea that one reviewer had and will make a full recipe and do that next time.  Can never have enough of this in the freezer!  Great to take on camping trips."
1229480,43611,12/6/2010,5,"This received rave reviews from my kids and extended family.  Be certain to give the ingredients a few weeks to blend.  We tried it within the first week and thought we'd made a mistake, however, another week or so and we loved it!"
66983,60876,11/18/2004,5,"Fabulous!  These are the best brownies I've ever made.  I didnt frost them, didnt think they needed it.  I had never baked with melted chocolate before and it was so easy and tastes so good...I'm throwing that cocoa powder away!  Thanks Evelyn!"
65056,60876,9/16/2005,5,"I was really stuck between giving these 4 or 5 stars, but after some thought, I decided that these were just as advertised (plain-old brownies).  These were a bit cakier than I like my brownies, but the top had this lovely crust that developed in the oven (as you can see in the recipes photo) that I really enjoyed.  I tried these fresh out of the oven and wasn't wild about them, but when I tried them the next day once they were completely cool they were much tastier.  I guess that's a good thing- brownies are only warm for so long, so I guess it's good if they're better cooled than warm! lol  The bittersweet chocolate really gives these great flavor, but I do think they're best cooled if you want the full impact of that flavor.  Thanks!"
41578,88682,2/12/2005,5,"These are GREAT potatoes!  The only thing I did differently  was to double the amount of garlic...ahhh yes...and used dried tarragon (didn't have fresh.) Can't wait to use fresh tarragon from my herb garden.  I sliced the potatoes VERY thin and it worked out great.  Thanks for sharing, Boca Pat, this will make a repeat performance on our table again and again.
"
117438,90508,5/17/2004,4,"These were really tasty and relatively easy to put together. The creaming was a step I am not used to with making muffins, and it did contribute to a cakey texture. I made 6 mega muffins and cooked them for 30 minutes. I also ran out of butter and had to use a little marg. Streusal is something I had not heard of before and even though I forgot the cinnamon, it really added a nice crunch. I also used frozen blueberries about 5 - 6 per muffin. Overall, very nice recipe. "
198601,90508,9/3/2008,0,"These had a great flavor.  Not too cupcakey, although sweeter than typical homemade muffins.  Used almond extract instead of vanilla and would recommend that."
125636,90508,7/31/2009,0,These did not turn out very well for me..they were so soft that I couldn't get them out of the pan. They were very very tasty though...so i would bake it as a cake ..but not as mini-muffins.
162398,99772,9/26/2004,5,Def wouldnt make this for guests but he was severely hung over and it worked better than mcdonalds! Thanks.
190336,99772,1/25/2005,5,OK - VERY GOOD HANG OVER FOOD! Better than a fag and Big Mac!
335363,99772,7/31/2006,0," *****
Thanx soooo much for a grt recipe.My 3yr old asked for seconds-served twice this week-end for breakfast.I served it with sausages.
31/07/2006"
435938,205121,1/28/2007,3,I made this for my very picky son - first time I tried I was out of milk and used dry milk. He did not like this! Next time I used fat free milk and he said it was good.
191809,219882,4/16/2007,5,This was great!  I used cooked fajita-seasoned bell peppers and onions in place of the onion powder and the whole dish was really good.  I made wraps and really enjoyed this!
245429,183729,12/31/2006,1,"Sorry, but we just didn't think too much of this recipe."
430471,264015,11/19/2007,5,"These were outstanding. But who could go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter. I made a lower fat version of these, but will make the real thing at Christmas time.
I did have to use chocolate chips, because the store was out of the M&M's and I used almonds cause I was out of pecans."
8688,264015,12/22/2007,5,"The perfect Christmas cookie!  I love the peanut butter and oatmeal combination!  I used old fashioned oats, pecans and regular sized M&M's which worked perfectly well.  I had to bake just a bit longer for the sides to bake, but I think my cookies may have been a touch more over the  1/4 cup.  Thanks again, Boomette, for another wonderful recipe : )"
166642,264015,9/9/2008,5,These are delicious cookies. I used peanuts and regular-sized M&Ms. My family enjoyed these a lot and I will make them again.
491095,264015,9/10/2008,5,I know these as Monster Cookies and they are GREAT!!
37305,264015,12/1/2008,5,"Absolutely FABULOUS!  Temp, time and yield are right on (I did get 27 cookies instead of 26!) I used quick cooking oats and instead of adding nuts, I used crunchy peanut butter.  These cookies didn't turn out quite as wide as I thought they would (because they don't spread much), but they are nice and chunky plus chewy.  Really delicious!  These are definitely going on my Christmas trays this year...thanks! Update 12/01/08: I made these last night with Old Fashioned Oats instead of Quick Cooking Oats.  This time they spread A LOT!  I'm wondering if the quick oats absorb some of the wetness of the mixture, more than the old-fashioned do.  Either way, these are delicious cookies!"
303700,264015,1/8/2009,5,"Made for Photo Tag. These bake up beautifully all toasted oats and peanut buttery flavour! I added a triple whammy by using Reeses peanut butter chips. As soon as I get a working camera,I will make them again and get a pic.
1/8/09
I made these again now that my camera is home again. :)
I used chocolate chips in place of M&M's and lots of peanuts leftover from Christmas.
they turned out just as nice as last time. Sorry it took so long for the pic, Boomie."
29655,264015,3/3/2009,5,Great way to get oatmeal cookies into the kids.  I got absolutely no complaints!  I made them as listed without the chopped nuts but with chocolate chips.  They were a hit!  Thanks for a winner!
444132,264015,5/19/2010,5,"Excellent cookies that are easy to make, and a real crowd pleaser!  I made these with regular M&M's, of which I only had 3/4 cup, so I used chocolate chips for the remainder.  The nuts I used were peanuts, which I thought would amplify the M&M aspect of the cookies.  These will definately go on my ""make again"" list!  Made for Sweet Traditions Tag.  Thanks for posting, Boomette!"
2000271443,264015,6/15/2015,0,"Oh, forgot to add, NO FLOUR in this recipe???"
169430,386706,9/2/2009,5,"I truly hate the tomato soup that you get in cans and have as far back as I can remember. When I saw this recipe I just had to try it and I'm so glad that I did. It's wonderful! I skipped the sugar, it truly wasn't needed and I had red bell pepper so that is what I used. The chunks of tomato, pepper and onion with the fragrant and flavorful herbs make an outstanding soup. At last, a tomato soup that actually tastes Great! Made for Photo Tag."
428885,386706,1/18/2010,5,"Yep, that's right. This is one quick, pow-pow tasting soup. Easy as the flick of a light to put in the pot, and sitting down to enjoy the afternoon writing, reading, or relaxing. I followed exactly, using green pepper, and all the other ingredients which were so important to make this taste so smooth, so delicious, and so refreshing. I used fresh thyme from my green house, minced up and put right in. Served with toasted bread on top, where you can slurp up the bottom and make sure you have all the soup out of the bowl! Perfect! Will make again! Made for *Diabetic Forum* Soup's On January 2010"
157425,386706,11/4/2010,5,"Fantastic tomato soup, so much better than the canned stuff! I used unsalted butter, vegetable broth, a red pepper, and petite diced tomatoes. Couldnt wait for the soup to finish cooking, it smelled and tasted great. Sliced a couple pieces of sourdough bread to go with the soup and enjoyed my lunch! Will definitely make this again it will be perfect on a cold winter day. Made and reviewed for Kittencal's Recipe Tag Game."
171790,386706,4/5/2011,5,Wow! This has so much flavor! We loved it. It was served as written as a first course with tonight's dinner. I added some Creole chicken to the remainder. That will do for lunches for the next couple of days. Made for Kittencal's Recipe Tag Game.
869184,386706,5/23/2011,4,We found this soup to be more like a minestrone than a tomato soup; I think that the bay leaf and sugar make it more mellow that a typical tomato soup. The tomato was not the predominat flavour which we had anticipated
498271,386706,1/8/2013,4,"Great easy, tasty and inexpensive soup!  I used more than a dash of cayenne for a little extra heat.  Yummy and low-cal as is, I think it would be great with some chicken or turkey sausage added as well.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
870705,386706,1/12/2013,5,This makes a delicious  soup.  I substituted 1 teaspoon of Creole seasoning for the spices but for us the tomatoes were a little to chunky......next time I would try mashing them up some but that's a matter of individual taste.  It was very easy to make.  Made for Football Pool 2012.
482376,386706,7/22/2013,5,I loved this soup!! The flavors are absolutely perfect and I had no need to adjust the seasonings. I ended up blending mine until smooth. I will definitely be making this often. Thank you! Made for ZWT0 and the Soup-A-Stars
179133,386706,2/26/2014,5,"I subbed orange pepper for the green and used vegetable broth. Otherwise followed the recipe but threw it in the blender once it was done cooking as I prefer a smoother tomato soup. Served with garlic toast, it made for a rather tasty dinner. Thanks for sharing!"
865936,487683,3/17/2013,4,"I love the dressing for the rice salad and definitely use the sriracha. My chicken came out perfectly cooked and moist, but I think it would have benefited by being pan-seared before being placed in the oven.  Made for PAC."
560491,487683,5/22/2013,5,"This was very good and light tasting!  I didn&#039;t use the sriracha but otherwise followed the recipe.  I did take threeovens&#039; advice and pan seared the chicken a little, made it look and taste amazing.  Will make this again!  Made for PRMR."
157425,64945,6/18/2006,4,"This was a nice dip that needed just a bit of zip. I chopped the artichoke's rather small and omitted the salt as the parmesan cheese was salty enough for us. Next time I would use less parmesan, add some herbs, and maybe garlic and green onion."
731027,64945,1/20/2008,4,This is how I like with NO mayo like so many recipes call for. I usually add about 1T or so minced garlic & sometimes about 1/2tsp dillweed....just perfect!!!
412530,107254,4/3/2010,5,THIS IS THE ONE!  There are so many Mississippi Mud's on the site but most of them have a graham cracker crust. I don't care for it. This is the best crust with this desert. I couldn't find my old recipe but am happy to find yours with the same combination. Thanks for sharing.
1613349,130161,6/21/2014,5,Yummy!  I used Tzatziki Sauce instead of greek dressing and added some hearty olives to the mix.  So refreshing on a warm summer night and easy to pack for a picnic.
267506,142712,11/26/2005,2,"Was looking for a new version of my husband's favorite.  The cake had an overwhelming taste of alcohol, probably 1/2 C is too much Kirschwasser.  The frosting was very good however, we had to throw the whole thing out."
59144,142712,2/14/2006,5,"DessertQueen, I made this recipe for my Mom and my Fiance' for Valentines Day, I added the drained Cherries to the batter and made it in a Bundt Pan. I drizzled Cream cheese icing on it & topped it with Chocolate Chips and Marischino Cherries and It was delicious!
Definetly a Keeper!
Thanks!"
56112,183729,10/8/2006,5,"I knew that I would love this....I just wasn't sure that the family would...but they did.  It got a ""thumbs up"" all the way around the table.  I did add a few chopped mushrooms....I think you put mushrooms in everything!!!"
247368,234171,5/11/2008,5,This is the simplest recipe for this dessert on Recipezaar at the moment. I followed it to the T and it tastes just like the dessert I love so much in the restaurants.
347922,234171,4/25/2009,5,SOOO good. Now I can have my favorite dish from Berkeley's Thai Temple without having to travel thousands of miles!
1251273,269690,12/22/2009,5,Thanks for a quick & easy recipe.  Made it a few times and found it absolutely scrumptious!!!  The different flavours blend in so well together.  I sometimes drain the artichoke oil to make it a bit healthier.
794242,269690,1/26/2010,5,This is my all time favorite recipe that you have posted all of the flavors blend together so that it's like a party in your mouth!  Our family LOVED it and my daughter had 3 helpings of it and she never even gets second helpings.  Both of my kids asked me to make this sometime soon!
870928,269690,2/28/2010,5,Loved this! Looking for something easy to cook for dinner and this was perfect! I will be putting this in my permanent file. GREAT MEAL!
96177,285000,5/17/2009,5,"Dh and I loved his recipe. I didn't process in the blender as directed, in stead we added the drained ingredients into the skillet and added some cornstarch to thicken. Very good burrito. Made for ZWT5!!"
2083567,285000,4/3/2013,5,"This is a keeper. I cut the recipe in half, other than that followed the recipe as prescribed, there was no need to process in the blender.Shredded the beef and put it back in the pot. The flavor was spot on! Leftovers were even better. Served w/rice and beans."
222564,285000,4/2/2014,5,Grand as is!
138799,311010,9/16/2008,5,"Delicious little buttery cookies that melt in your mouth! They're a snap to whip up because the cookie press does all the work! I made just a half batch and easily got over 4 dozen cookies, but lost exact count cuz I was samplin them! I look forward to using this recipe for the holidays and play with the different shapes, colors, and decorating them! Thanks for sharing your recipe tina rose!:)
Made for PAC Fall 08"
537179,311010,9/24/2009,5,"Awesome! These were so good. Reminded me of those little danish cookies you can get around Christmas in the tin cans. I had never ever worked with a cookie press before, I'm so glad I tried this recipe. They were enjoyed by all. I'll be making them again. Made for PAC Fall 2009"
922195,314983,12/24/2008,5,"This is really delicious and a crowd pleaser.  Made it for a Christmas party and the colors are quite festive, although I'll be anxious to try this in the summer when tomatos are in season and even more delicious."
318235,314983,3/24/2010,5,"I had gone to post this awhile ago from my ATK cookbook and I saw you already beat me to it!This is excellent, though I did make a few changes in processes which I hope you don't mind. I only used one sheet of puff pastry and just smoothed the folds with my fingers. Then rather than cut off the side pieces I just folded the outside in about 1/2 inch the whole way around. I did poke thoroughly before baking but it puffed up a lot, which really didn't end up being a problem, I was just surprised by the size of it lol. To the tomatoes I added salt as well as sprinkled them liberally with garlic powder. Even though the pastry was all puffed up I just laid the tomatoes on top and once it baked the juices deflated the pastry a little. This was so yummy. I served it as a side to a steak salad and it made a perfect dinner. Thank you for the recipe!"
1041500,342135,12/10/2008,5,"I made this recipe tonight and my son, a 6 yr old- who is a very picky eater loved it! Thank you so much for sharing."
1083594,342135,12/18/2008,4,Delicious!
369715,342135,4/8/2010,4,This was good an easy to make. I followed the recipe as written except that added some pepper to the mixture. I used a can of peas and carrots instead of mixed veggies. We all enjoyed this. Made for Spring PAC 2010.
1358170,353952,8/20/2009,5,Everyone I have fed this too has gone absolutely CRAZY over it. I'm making it tonight for the 5th time in a month =)
424680,426090,5/29/2010,5,"Really enjoyed working with the mustard seeds here & will have to find additional recipes in which I can use them! Glad that I didn't cut the recipe in half, because although there were just 2 of us for eating these beans, they didn't last but about 2 meals! Really enjoyed the combo of the seeds & the seasonings here! Definitely a keeper of a recipe! [Made & reviewed while in Asia with ZWT6]"
527886,426090,5/31/2010,3,"Very mild. I would double the ginger and coriander, even for kids, just to have some taste beyond basic green beans. I only used 2 tbl of oil, and that was still way too much for this amount of vegetables. I would suggest the barest amount to saute the mustard seeds."
383346,426090,5/31/2010,5,I used 2 tablespoon of canola oil.  And I used 1/2 cup green onion.  I didn't use salt.  I simmered the veggies near 12 minutes to have the green beans tender.  Cause I don't like when it's still crunchy.  This is really good with the lemon juice.   Thanks Momaphet :)  Made for the Zwizzle Chicks of ZWT
107135,426090,6/1/2010,5,"ok i used canned beans  cooked carrtos 1st . cut down oil added drained beans last . i didnt add salt , personal for me . i know this would be great with fresh beans but was good with the canned  try this recipe .zaar tour 6"
895132,426090,6/1/2010,5,"I had to use sweet potato instead of the carrot, but they do taste quite similar, so I don't think this makes such a great difference. Wonderful easy, quick and tasty green bean dish - I love green beans, and this definitely is a way I will eat them again! Thanks for posting.
Made for the Unrulies Under the Influence on ZWT6 Germany / Asia."
29655,426090,6/2/2010,5,"Easy, quick dish with ingredients I already had on hand.  I loved this preparation for green beans.  I did use onion powder instead of fresh onion.  It was good but next time I'll use fresh onion.  The lemon juice really adds to the flavor.  Thanks for posting.  This is definitely a keeper.  Made for ZWT6."
844554,426090,3/13/2011,5,Very good beans. Loved the spices and it's the first time for me using mustard seeds. I cut the recipe down for hubby and me and shouldn't have... we wanted more!! Made for PAC Spring 2011.
143721,426090,8/17/2012,5,Great new way to do green beans.  I really like the mustard seeds in this dish.  Made for ZWT8 and The Wild Bunch.
166642,426090,8/18/2012,5,"I love green beans and these were delicious. Loved the flavors and it was really quick and easy. Made for ZWT8 for the Diners, Winers and Chives team."
690623,426090,8/14/2017,5,An excellent treatment for green bean. I will be making these often. Thanks for posting! Made for CQ4
227978,426090,8/15/2017,5,"This was an excellent way to prepare green beans. I loved the bit of a kick from the mustard seeds. I'm glad I chose this recipe. It was really good. Thanks, momaphet. Made for Culinary Quest 2017 (Himalayas)."
226863,426090,8/15/2017,5,I believe this may be one of the best green bean recipes I've had lately! We will definitely make it again. Even the non-green bean eaters ate this recipe. Thanks for sharing! Made for CQ 2017 for the Smok'in Chefs.
305531,426090,8/20/2017,5,"We really enjoyed these beans. Simple but good. Thanks for sharing, Linda. Made for CQ4."
482376,426090,2/9/2018,5,Really good beans and carrots! I loved the extra flavor boost. Thank you! Made for the Best of 2017 tag.
88378,445577,7/25/2012,5,"Very good - we all enjoyed this.  I used just 1 jalapeno, and I omitted the ginger altogether because the heat level was perfect... which is to say plenty spicy.  I found it easy to mix the coconut milk and cornstarch right in the can with a slim whisk (save washing a bowl).  Next time I will add a little more basil to the dish.  This is a winner!"
2114486,445577,7/4/2013,3,"I&#039;d suggest using green curry paste, rather than curry powder, for a fresher and more authentic flavor.  If you can&#039;t find Thai basil, again I&#039;d suggest using  regular fresh basil rather than cilantro."
900992,445577,10/2/2013,3,"We added an extra jalapeno pepper and used Thai basil, but we found this borderline bland. It needs much more heat and flavor. I would probably throw in 2 or 3 Thai peppers if I were to make this again."
40804007,451297,8/28/2013,4,"These crackers had a great flavor, but I made mine from regular almond flour and they were much darker in color than the ones shown. They froze really well too!"
2001676733,531712,8/18/2017,5,This is my third time making this recipe. It's yummy!
956121,18204,9/14/2008,5,"These muffins turned out fluffy, weren't too sweet and didn't stick to the pan.  I used 3 large bananas."
107583,18204,9/18/2008,4,"These are very good, not too sweet (I used Splenda).  You should list Splenda in the ingredients list (it won't ""distort"" the numbers, since Zaar does not recognize it as an ingredient, but it would be less likely to be left out by someone not reading closely.  Also you have no oven temperature listed.  I baked mine at 350F.  I will be making these again, but will add some cinnamon and nutmeg also.  Made for Fall 2008 PAC."
962521,18204,10/21/2008,4,"I thought they were great, though my sister didn't."
28649,33096,7/29/2002,5,This was very simple and very refreshing.  This is perfect for this warm weather.  Thanks for recommening this Merlot.
30298,33096,7/30/2002,4,Light and refreshing!  I used a reduced fat graham crust and light cool whip and still had a tasty treat!
87300,33096,6/22/2003,5,"This is such a perfect summer dessert, and SO easy, too!! I made it as a strawberry lemonade pie, as my DH loves strawberries; I used 2 teaspoons Crystal Light (sugar-free) lemonade mix (same amount of water), light vanilla frozen yogurt (2 cups, which I think is a pint!), Cool Whip Free, and a Keebler reduced fat graham cracker crust (I couldn't find the larger size, but the regular one worked fine -- I just piled it on!). Then I sliced some strawberries into a bowl and crushed a few soft ones and sprinkled on a tiny bit of Crystal Light lemonade mix and stirred, then topped the pie slices with it. It was SO good!! And it reminded me a little of cheesecake, which I love. I recommend the strawberry topping if you like strawberries, as it added great color and flavor. The way I made it, I figure it as 4 Weight Watcher points (about 200 calories) per serving, for 8 servings. Thank you, Merlot!!!"
22973,33096,8/11/2003,5,"Merlot,
  I took the ingredients for making this rcipe with me when we went camping last week,Soooooooooo GLAD I did,It was 95 in the shade andI made these.Ohhhhh My Gosh!!
These were so cool and refrehing,and so easy to make.Yum!!! Thanks so much,
Darlene Summers"
37449,33096,8/31/2003,5,So easy and so good! My husband and son scarfed this up!
89831,33096,3/15/2004,5,"Merlot...this is the second time that I made your lemonade icecream pie, it is so light, yummy and refreshing, my Dh just loves lemons..we had some company over tonight, so I made two of them in the morning and stuck them in the freezer (I will keep one for DH and myself).... they just raved about it, I sent home the recipe with one person, this is such a delicious pie, I can't wait to serve this at my BBQ parties this summer, this is winner, thanks so much for posting Merlot :-)"
101034,33096,6/15/2004,5,"What a great tasting, refreshing dessert this is. It was heavenly. Everyone enjoyed it. I used a chocolate cookie crumb crust,  lite cool whip and sugar free country time. It was SOOOOO good. No one had any idea it was sort of low cal. Thanks Merlot"
95810,33096,7/8/2004,5,This pie is so easy and so delicious!  I made a strawberry lemonade flavored one and used some strawberry cool whip with it.  Very good.  I also made a plain lemon one.  This is a perfect summer dessert.  Very light and refreshing. Thanks for the great recipe!
107308,33096,7/17/2004,5,"Such an easy and delicious pie! We really liked the light texture and delicate taste of lemon.  I think one could add more of the lemonade mix for more intense lemon flavor.  I used a mild chocolate graham cracker crust (not the dark chocolate one) and topped with shavings of Hershey bar.  The pie looked lovely!  I am now wondering if this would work with the fruit flavored lemonade mixes?  Thanks Merlot, for such a nice dessert recipe!"
130819,33096,7/25/2005,5,Added this one to my dessert table awhile back and it was an absolute hit with my guests. It is a perfect summer dessert. Since we love 'lemon everything' I already have requests that this be one of the desserts at our next gathering!  Thanks for sharing a recipe we all enjoyed.
229524,33096,5/21/2006,5,"So easy to make and so tasty. Made Uncle Bill's Turkey (462620) for dinner and this was a very nice, light dessert to have.   "
130896,33096,7/25/2006,5,"I tried this recipe because it sounded so easy, almost foolproof, and it turned out great.  It was very refreshing and not too heavy and disappeared quickly.  Thanks-Joan"
195175,33096,5/21/2007,5,"I found this recipe in the new Kraft Food and Family Magazine and was going to post it, but I found you had already done so. Thank you Merlot. This is a great, and very tasty summer pie. I like that you can always have the ingredients on hand. I used lite ice cream and cool whip to cut calories. Yummy."
231054,33096,10/25/2007,5,"I love this -- and idea behind it.  I'm sure you could use other flavors and still come up with a very refreshing and easy to throw together dessert!  I had Crystal Light lemonade powder and used it.  BUT I think I should have cut back to probably about half of the 1/3 cup.  It's VERY lemony!!  I used no sugar added vanilla ice cream and the lite Cool Whip.  I loved reading the other reviews -- and have picked up some good ideas from those chefs.  Thank you, Merlot, this is a fantastic recipe."
28201,33096,5/25/2008,5,"This review is about a year too late!  I made this last summer, and loved it so much I must have made it a dozen times.  I'm hosting a grill out tomorrow for Memorial Day and I lost my written copy, so I logged on and saw that I never reviewed it!   This has just the right amount of lemony ""tang"" and yet it is so light and refreshing.  I also splurge and use Hagen-Daaz vanilla ice cream.  I'm sure I'll make this a lot this summer too!  Thanks Merlot!"
811602,33096,6/24/2008,5,Terrific and easy recipe. I keep the ingredients on hand so that I always have a good dessert to take to someone's house. Everyone always asks for the recipe.
250031,33096,6/26/2008,5,"Wonderful! Made this for my husband's birthday on this hot, humid summer day. Very refreshing, very easy--very nice!"
29404,33096,7/1/2008,5,"What a tasty surprise.  I love it when super easy recipes taste super good.  TY so much for posting.  This will be a ""do-again"" and again, and again..........."
297380,33096,7/9/2008,5,What a wonderful recipe for these hot days we are having.  Next time I will make 2 or 3 and freeze them to have handy.  Thanks for sharing!
381411,33096,7/16/2008,5,We really loved this!   Very refreshing for the summertime.  I can't wait to make it again!     Thanks!
64583,33096,7/1/2009,5,What a delicious pie!  I give it 5 stars even though for some reason my husband and kids weren't overly fond of it.  I've decided they must be crazy!  That's the only possible reason for not loving this pie!   Thanks for posting!
870928,33096,9/17/2009,5,"OMG we loved this! Served to 4 people and everyone raved.  My DH said I can make this anytime.  Cool, creamy, and fantastic! Very easy to put together too.  This will become a favorite I'm sure of it!"
470894,33096,4/27/2010,5,"so simple to put together and very refreshing.  I did add a bit more lemonade powder for a little more tang.  Use good quality ingredients and let them speak for themselves. In this case, less is more.  Thanks for the great recipe."
666947,33096,6/6/2010,5,"This recipe is so simply and delicious! I used Strawberry Lemonade mix instead of regular and it was amazing. Thanks for sharing, this recipe is a keeper!"
804490,33096,7/3/2010,5,"So easy and delicious!  Like another reviewer, I used sugar free lemonade mix - 3 teaspoons; same amount of water; and light homemade vanilla ice cream with sugar free cool-whip.  It was excellent!"
570804,33096,7/26/2010,5,"What a simple and wonderful frozen pie - I thought that it might be too big for just the 2 of us but afraid I was wrong.   Disappeared in a couple of days.  Thanks for something easy, wonderful and light tasting."
791227,33096,7/27/2010,5,"I have been making this recipe for years and it is always requested; especially in the hot summer months. Instead of instant, I use 6 oz. of frozen lemonade concentrate, and sometimes even deepen the hue with yellow food coloring. I also, ocassionally, make individual pies in the mini graham cracker crusts. This way, those not used are available for future desserts and their presentation remains intact."
257968,33096,4/10/2011,4,"I also used frozen lemonade concentrate--a 6 oz. can, softened.  I also used slightly softened ice cream--2 cups.  I did have too much filling for my crust, but I just froze the extra for a snack.  Delicious, easy, and refreshing!"
195589,33096,5/10/2011,5,"O Yummmmm!! LIke another reviewer, I used frozen lemonade concentrate. Since we are having a heat wave (in Feb.) here in CA, I made this a few days ago, and it was perfectly light and delicious! Thanks for posting, Merlot!  : )"
2001513060,33096,4/29/2017,5,"This was a wonderful dessert. Just the right amount of lemon flavor. I made individual tarts, they came out cute and tasty!!!!"
61660,33798,11/20/2002,5,"Most time consuming part was dicing the meat, but sure was worth it!  Everyone raved about it and I have already had requests for more."
323120,33798,8/31/2006,5,This was dead on the the money.Almost the way my Babcia taught me.She never used Lamb or beef .It was too expensive!!!! Her insistance.
141293,33798,4/18/2009,5,"Kim127 made this for Easter and was nice enough to give me a serving.  It is sooo delicious!!  I am making my version this weekend for my parents and I know they will love it.  I will be using lamb, beef, chicken and kielbasa."
45833,56916,4/5/2003,5,DEEE-licious!!! My husband says it deserves 10 stars!! He asked for a piece.. then changed it to several pieces--for his bag lunch. I will be making this often!! I followed the recipe exactly--except for the pecans as I didn't have any. Thanks for posting!! :)
109395,56916,10/26/2003,5,"This is a really easy cake for special events. Have made it for years. Try chocolate butter fudge cake mix with pecans and/or coconut in the topping part. The recipe we used didn't call for pecans, but I love them and add them as often as I have them."
10113,56916,12/26/2005,5,this was a big hit in my christmas gift baskets the fist thing gone
366864,56916,10/19/2006,5,"My mom use to bake a cake just like it she called it The Ugly Cake,this brought so many great memories!!!!!!!Try it, you'll fall in love!!!!!!!"
338672,56916,12/5/2006,5,Just like the ones I used to eat when I lived at home. I'm so happy I found it again.
352814,56916,1/7/2007,4,"Extremely sweet (a little too much so for my taste-just personal preference).  I also was expecting it to be a little more ""ooey gooey.""  However, it is very yummy."
473806,56916,12/17/2007,5,Love this spin (nuts) on an old family favorite of mine.  Thanks for the awesome recipe revival.  EVERYONE who tried this loved it and wants the recipe.  Don't worry I'm giving you all the credit!
231507,56916,4/29/2012,5,"Been making this for years, but could not find my recipe today. Made for a trivia fundraiser tonight and it was enjoyed by all at our table. Thanks Georgia Peach for posting!!"
1802878096,56916,7/2/2014,0,"Not thrilled, my husband liked it but it was not near as good as that from my local grocery store! No crunch in the crust and no gooey center.... A little dry...... But again my husband liked it so not a complete failure!!!"
5060,63189,6/16/2010,5,"Very flavourful chicken!!  we loved the basil and garlic and the prosciutto was a wonderful addition; the Parmesan was a perfect finish, thanks for posting I will be making this one again."
136997,63189,8/29/2010,5,Absolutely delicious. I used fresh basil from my garden. :)
50472,77001,12/19/2003,5,"Oh, I have eaten way too many of these!  They are addictive!  It was super simple to make.  The nuts turn out very glossy and shiny.  They look beautiful in a glass jar.  I must give these away before I eat them all!   "
47892,77001,11/16/2007,5,"'Melon, I uses this recipe to caramelize hazelnuts and it worked beautifully. Do heed the warning in step #7 to avoid burning the nuts. Used local honey and Oregon grown hazelnuts. A million grazies!  cg ;)"
1091591,77001,12/22/2008,5,"I made this recipe for the first time tonight and I have to say it was one of the easiest party/snack foods I have ever made, and they taste awesome!
 The Second batch I did however add a little cinnamon(about 1/4 teaspoon) and it was great both ways.
Thanks a bunch W.M.
Kudos"
1215879,77001,3/25/2009,5,quick & easy...great in salads.
125356,77001,1/16/2012,5,To dye for!
620435,82122,11/23/2007,5,This was the most tender pulled pork ever.  The foil is the secret as it keeps the top of it from drying out.  I added a bottle of barbque sauce to the ginger ale so both cooked together.  The meat just fell apart and shredded very easily.  I then mixed in more barbque sauce after shredding.  Everyone love it.  Thanks for sharing this.  I may use the foil method when cooking beef in the crock pot as well.
765036,82122,1/28/2009,5,I have made this recipe several times.  It is a favorite around my house.  my boyfriend loves it and we often have friends over when we eat it.  our favorite restraunt is sonny's bbq and this is just as good and alot cheaper.  thanks!
643099,82122,2/4/2010,5,There is only one word for this pulled pork: FABULOUS!!!! It was incredibly simple to make and absolutely impossible to resist! I can't wait for those summer barbecue parties!
347441,82122,6/16/2010,5,My son loves pulled pork but can't have barbecue sauce.  This has become his favorite way of having his pulled pork.   So simple to do.  Have used rootbeer and not enjoyed as much as this recipe.
1016302,82122,7/24/2010,5,Simple and easy! After I pulled the pork apart I put it back in the crock pot with BBQ sauce for 1-2 hrs. Will use this recipe again!!!
1340977,82122,3/12/2011,5,Two words...simple and DELICIOUS! Thanks for posting.
1181842,82122,11/13/2012,5,"My family loves this recipe! Very tasty. The only variations i make are to cut up an onion in the bottom and set the roast directly on top of them (no foil). After 12 hours I remove the onions, shred the meat, add the bbq sauce and cook on low another 3-4 hours. My only complaint is the amount of time it takes to cook."
199631,124701,7/3/2006,5,I have made this many times and got rave reviews
124190,177950,5/20/2007,5,"These were very,very good. I made them on my indoor grill, and they turned out great. Very juicy. I did use a little less salt. I did have some trouble keeping them together, but I think that was my fault. I don't think I worked them meat togther quite enough. Thanks for a great recipe that I will definitely make again!"
567134,177950,6/22/2008,5,These came out very juicy and tender.  This is a keeper !
278113,177950,7/22/2009,5,"I really enjoyed these burgers!  We made two different recipes, and these were by far the best. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
322381,204250,1/31/2007,3,"Very easy to make, very economical and it smells great when cooking. I don't know that we'd make it again, but it is a good recipe to modify to your tastes, like Silverjazz says. Love the addition of cayenne, and we put a lot. One thing though- I felt that it was more than 3 servings, just because it yields a whole lotta sauce!"
53959,205535,1/29/2007,5,These were really good. I had a ham already in the oven so this worked out perfectly. Everything was done at the same time. I loved the cinnamon flavor of the yams. Thank you for this great recipe.
412186,211570,11/8/2007,3,"Very good, easy to make."
326787,205535,9/6/2007,4,"These are good, but maybe just a little too sweet for us. I only had 1 cup of cinnamon candies so that was all I used and they were still really sweet. Next time I will cut down on the sugar or maybe the candies. Just a note: We ate leftover potatoes a couple of days later and they did not seem quite as sweet after reheating."
803511,205535,7/30/2008,5,Oh Twis...these are tasty.  I knew I would like them being a huge sweet potato fan and the cinnamon candies were such an interesting twist.  I ate them with a ham steak for dinner and then had another serving for dessert!  I think I might toss some toasted pecans in with my leftover potatoes.  Thanks for the fun treat.
297272,206084,5/2/2007,5,"These were the best bran muffins I've ever made!  I ran out of applesauce so I used a small (mashed) banana instead of 1/4 cup of it.  I also replaces the brown sugar with 1/4 cup honey and added chopped dates!!!  SOOO moist, and the sweetness of the dates worked amazingly well with the honey flavour!"
356476,206084,7/23/2007,4,"These were pretty good for ""healthy"" muffins.  I followed the recipe, but added 1 chopped apple, 1/4 cup raisins, 1/3 cup of chopped walnuts, and an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I'm not sure I would have enjoyed them as much if I hadn't added the extras.  I had to leave them in for almost 20 min, but maybe that's because of the extras. Thank you for the low fat/high fibre recipe!"
604139,206084,1/22/2008,5,"These are a yummy, healthy muffin. I altered the recipe a bit: I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, added 2 tsp baking powder, used 2 cups unprocessed bran, 1/4 cup brown sugar, added 1/2 cup raisins, and left the rest of the recipe as-is. They came out really well-the perfect amount of moistness, not too sweet but not tasteless at the same time. Thanks for a great recipe! I will definitely make these again."
1923002,206084,6/2/2011,5,"Awesome, my whole family loves them.  I make them almost weekly.  I have used all bran, bran flakes, wheat germ and oat bran and they turn out great every time.  Also have added raspberries on occasion.  I have passed this recipe along to many people!"
310518,253590,4/15/2008,5,"Wow!  This is the first Thai recipe I've ever tried.  It has a rather pungent fragrance, but is very light and refreshing.   I made it exactly as written except I used regular fish sauce because I couldn't find less-sodium version even in the Asian market.  It came out fine!  Very nice combo of flavors and textures.  We'll be eating this again! Thanks, Chef Romie.  Made for Pick A Chef Spring 2008."
604499,306919,6/11/2008,4,"I give this recipe 4 stars because the combination of flavors is excellent!  However, I felt that the gelato itself was more the consistency of iced milk and lacked the creaminess of most gelato I have eaten previously.  I'm planning to play around with the gelato recipe a little bit and see if I can get the consistency to match that at my favorite little haunt."
144490,306919,6/12/2008,4,"A few tweaks and this would be five stars for me. Flavor and presentation are fives, for sure! I made petite chocolate bowls using the balloon techniques as in Recipe #161209. 8 oz. chocolate yielded me 12 bowls. I searched high and low for espresso powder but couldn't find it. I knew instant coffee just wouldn't give the same flavor so I just used 2 shots of espresso instead. My gelato was lighter but the right flavor was there. I think I will substitute some cream for some the milk next in hopes of a creamier gelato. I adored the cinnamon cream, had to add a bit more cream as mine was too thick but I could have eaten a bowl of that alone. This would really be an impressive dessert for company as you can see from my photos. Advice though, do as much as you can the day before, it will make assembly much faster. Go Babes!  Zaar World Domination!"
337120,306919,6/15/2008,4,"DD and I attempted this recipe for Fathers Day.  I agree with other reviews that milk alone does not create a creamy texture, so I might try with cream or half & half next time.  Also, we were not able to achieve a whipped topping effect with the small amount of heavy cream indicated and ended up using a pint (and reduced the cinnamon by half.)  We knew that the chocolate bowls were beyond our expertise so we made amaretto flavored chocolate bark with shelled pistachios which turned out great.  One thing we completely forgot when it came to serving time was the warmed nutella sauce, but none of us thought it really needed it anyway.  We loved all the various flavors.  Thanks for sharing!"
383346,306919,6/22/2008,5,I loved the creaminess of this gelato.  Why buy gelato if we can do our own.  And this one is perfect.  I loved the taste of espresso and amaretto (which I added at the end when the ice cream was almost ready).  All the ingredients are made to be together.  This is pure heaven.  Thanks Babes.  Good luck!  Made for the Babes of ZWT4.
141569,306919,6/24/2008,4,"I agree with wath others said, taste is great, but the consistency isn't great. I think you would need too make a custard with coffee taste and then freeze it. But as said, the taste is really good! Made for ZWT4."
987941,306919,2/28/2009,5,OH MY GOSH!!!!!!! this is amazing. i will send it to everyone i know! I used whipping cream instead of milk and i halved the recipe since i have a small ice cream machine. But i will be making this alot it is my kryptonite. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!
954555,306919,3/10/2009,5,"You shound'nt be allowed to post these kinds of receipes, they are sooooo fattening, but OHHHHHHHH SOOOO good!!!!!!!!!
I made these over the wkend and they were a real hit.  Everyone loved them, as one of the members said, "" THIS IS PURE HEAVEN!!!!!!!!""  Thankyou soooo much for posting this wonderful receipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UMMMMMMMMMMM"
93911,306919,7/8/2010,0,"I haven't tried this recipe so I'm not rating it, but I just wanted to say that you can easily make chocolate bowls by dipping paper or silicon muffin cups in chocolate and letting them harden, then just peel off the muffin cup.  I usually dip once, let harden, then dip again."
27643,14813,10/15/2002,5,"YUMMY!!! This is great! The chops are tender and juicy, the sauce is devine!! Such an easy recipe. The only changes I made were not using the pimento and I cut the peas in half. All I had to add was rolls and salad. This is definitly a KEEPER!!! Thanks RecipeNut! "
53522,14813,2/10/2003,4,This recipe was very good.
2477403,14813,11/1/2012,0,"Yick, yick, yick. No one in my family of five liked this recipe and we're pretty experimental when it comes to cooking. It was fast and easy to make. But we'll never make it again. Sorry"
840768,14813,8/28/2013,5,"Tasty recipe. I amended it for the pressure cooker &amp; adjusted a few ingredients. Decreased the potatoes &amp; increased the mushrooms, peas &amp; worcestershire abit. There was quite abit of sauce so I will cut back the soup mixture next time (or sub yogurt for some to cut fat &amp; sodium). I also used fresh garlic while I was browning the pork chops to add more flavour. The combination of the pork with the potatoes &amp; peas mixture was a nice change &amp; enjoyed by all."
262966,20041,4/18/2006,2,"Unfortunately, this turned out kind of bland for my taste.  I will try it again however, and add some tomato sauce and some crushed red pepper, as well as some additional tabasco."
58104,32129,12/2/2002,5,"Quick and easy!
I also added 1/2 cup of roasted unsalted seame seeds and 2 tablespoons of honey.
Deliciously sweet!"
64154,32129,1/10/2004,4,"The flavor was great. Unlike peanut brittle, it is loaded with the sunflowerseeds. 
The store only had non-salted dry roasted sunflower seeds. I felt the brittle could of been more salty. Salted seeds would probably take care of this. "
64203,32129,3/2/2005,5,"I had a huge bag of dry roasted sunflower seeds in my pantry and had no idea what to do with them. I made this recipe and it was so good! My seeds were salted, so I think the flavor of this brittle was just right. It was so easy to make and it was easier to clean up after than I thought it would be too. I have more seeds and will be making this yummy treat again! Thank you!"
182809,32129,10/2/2008,5,"Sharon, I both love AND hate you because of this recipe!  It turned out great and was loved by all that tasted it BUT......I too, loved it.....that's where the hate comes in.  I truly finished it up to the last drop, just what my figure needed, HAHA!  Neverthe less, this is a great item to add to your cahdy tray for the holidays."
186855,32129,11/16/2008,5,"Perfect, and so quick and easy.  Wonderful flavour.  Thanks for sharing."
946146,32129,12/6/2008,5,Diana #2 made this for me in the 2008 Cookie Swap.  Boy am I glad she did!  It was so good there isn't any left to share with company.  I guess I'll have to make some more :)
60124,32129,9/2/2009,5,"utterly decadent! used a mix of sunflower and sesame seeds, I cant believe how good this tastes!!!"
895132,32129,10/23/2010,5,"This was wonderful! I had no salted sunflower seeds and used 1/2 cup of erythritol and 2 tablespoons honey instead of the sugar, and it turned out soooo good! Thanks for posting this, I'll make it again and again!<br/>Made for Cook-A-Thon for Sharon in memory of her husband."
539686,32129,12/1/2012,5,This is so easy and good. I doubled the recipe and it made quite a nice batch. I poured it out onto my Silpat sheet and clean up was no fuss. I'll definitely make it again. Thanks Sharon!
232669,234183,1/2/2010,5,"Hello seemefli, I made these for the nursing home where I live - it is a Cuban facility and anything green gives them an allergy! (LOL) However, when we made these we sliced them very thin and as a previous reviewer stated, I added cilantro, red pepper flakes, a dash of nutmeg and Parmesan cheese. We also used some of the cheese as a garnish for the top. These tasted awesome, as I love spinach, but they were a great success! Thank you so much for posting, Manami :)"
398275,32129,12/1/2012,5,"This was my first attempt at making brittle and I wanted to try it for three reasons.  First, I L.O.V.E. brittle.  Put whatever nuts in it you'd like, I'm going to eat it.  Second, I always have the ingredients in my pantry and fridge.  Third, and most important, it doesn't require a candy thermometer.  (They scare me!)  This recipe is the perfect combination of salty and sweet and one that will definitely be made for holiday parties.  I'll bet it would be fantastic with a light drizzle of melted semi-sweet chocolate on top.  I'll try that next time and let you know how it turns out.  Thanks for sharing, Sharon.  This is a keeper!"
522583,32129,12/21/2012,0,"Simply wonderful... I only had unsalted dry roasted seeds, so I used salted butter... Great recipe for peanut allergies..."
573325,32129,2/2/2013,5,"I had never made brittle before, because I was very scared of the process, but your recipe sounded so straight forward that I just had to try it. I must say, I will make this often again: It really is easy if you have time and patience. My sugar took ages to melt, but once it had melted, everything was so easy and quick and my brittle is already ready for eating. YUM! I used a chili flavoured oil to add a bit of heat and find it completements the sweetness from the sugar nicely. THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this winner with us, Sharon. I cant wait to make gift baggies with this.<br/>Made and reviewed for our VIP Veggie Swap # 55 February 2013."
47892,32129,2/20/2013,5,"This recipe was cut in half although the amount of butter was doubled from 1 tablespoon to 2 tablespoons. I also added 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract and most importantly used two teflon pans to melt the butter and the sugar (made for much easier clean up-NO scrubbing of pans!)  Instead of buttering a baking sheet, I lined an 8"" square Pyrex pan with parchment paper and used a small piece of parchment paper to spread and smooth the top of the brittle. This part must be done quickly before the mixture hardens but carefully so as not to burn yourself. Looking forward to all kinds of variations of this recipe! Made for SUN & SPICE Event/Veg Tag February."
26637,32129,9/9/2014,5,"This was my first attempt at brittle of any kind.  I was pleased with the results and it was much easier than I expected. I like that it doesn&#039;t require a candy thermometer.   I will keep this recipe and definitely make it again. I would like to try some of the seasonings suggested by other reviewers, just for a different taste.  But this was a big hit at my sunflower themed event."
2000331850,32129,7/11/2015,4,"I was delighted to discover this simple, delicious recipe. A great change from peanut butter brittle."
13483,120964,5/15/2005,5,"Well these are just gems.  They are so much better than ordinary baked potatoes with sour cream in my opinion!!  If you're baking 'em anyway why not smash 'em!!  I did not have fenned seeds but I did use some celery seeds, granulated garlic, carraway seeds and parmesan cheese with the olive oil.  Just terrific.  Thank you CookingMonster."
60486,120964,9/1/2008,5,"Very good. I was looking for a fennel recipe and thought this looked interesting. Super simple and easy. Made no changes or substitutions. Served with recipe #113483 and recipe #237133. I can see myself preparing these again, and trying some of the variations. Had some leftovers which reheated well: microwave until lukewarm and put in toaster oven at 450-500 for approx. 5mins."
37449,120964,11/3/2008,5,I used fingerling potatoes and enjoyed them! Thanks!
1111928,120964,6/14/2010,5,Very good. However I did tweek it a little since I don't really care for fennel. I drizzled the potatoes with basil flavored olive oil and topped with cheddar cheese and fresh chives out of my garden.
2503874,129377,11/16/2012,4,set up beautifully once it was completely cool. I added a sprinkle of nutmeg on top and loved the added flavor.
197788,194799,6/13/2007,4,This was tasty! I left out the zucchini as we don't like it. The only problem I had was I didn't have a lid for my cast iron skillet so I just put tinfoil over it.
445432,219435,4/1/2007,4,"Halved the recipe and baked in 13x9 pyrex dish. Watched the batter rising in the oven and thought I had totally ruined them but the middle sank as they cooled. Tasted close to the ones I had in elementary school but I will definately cut back on the sugar. My DD ate them for breakfast : )
Edit:  Had a couple other people try them this w/e and they thought they tasted like the ones we had in elementary school."
124449,223868,5/3/2007,5,"This was very good, and just enough different from the way I normally make ham salad to make it worthwhile!  I did add 2 hard boiled eggs, and used sweet pickles rather than pickle relish, just because of personal preferences.  I will definitely make this one again!  Thanks for posting!"
237951,223868,8/1/2008,5,"Hurray! A new salad for DH to have for lunch sometimes!  He's happy and so am I.  He doesn't like mayo or vinegar type dressings much, so this was a wonderful discovery for us.  I might try the dressing on chicken---if I do, I'll let you know how we liked it.  Thanks."
1198780,234183,3/10/2009,0,"I have tried this recipe several times and it has turned out great, and enjoyed by everyone.  I use baby spinach, so that I can skip direction # 2.  I have also added 4 green chillies and 1/2 cup chopped corriander; a dash of pepper and 1/2 cup Grana Padano parmesan cheese.  I save some of the shredded mozzarella to sprinkle on the top.  My family refers to this as ""Spinach Squares"" and it is surely a delish one!!!"
1239906,234183,9/8/2014,5,"This dish is even better at room temperature or cold than it is hot.  I used frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed out) and sauteed the onion with a few cloves of minced garlic before adding them to the mix.  The squares have a pie crust taste about them after baked, similar to a quiche.  I halved the recipe and used a square baking pan, same cooking time, and they turned out perfectly."
62264,278617,5/15/2008,5,Wonderful recipe! Cut 2 whole breasts from a bird into strips & proceded as directed. Doubled sauce & added about a teaspoon of fennel seed. Got pulled away from stove so added a cup of chardonnay & let simmer after step 7. Added 1/2 cup fresh chopped Italian parsley a couple of minutes before plating. Served as suggested with rigatoni. Otstanding piquant gently tempered by the balsamic vinegar. I can't wait to make with garden fresh tomatoes & basil w/o interruption this summer. Thank you Alotizzi for a real keeper!
818279,308940,11/23/2009,5,Nobody can eat just one!  These were yummy delicious little morsels.  At first people thought they were small peanut butter cookies because I did the cross-hatch with a fork.  Next time I'll roll out thin and cut into squares.  DELICIOUS recipe.  I didn't change a thing.  Thanks for sharing!
1900993,337682,4/17/2012,5,A very light and moist cake with chocolate chips and cinnamon giving it a suitable icing that adds to the flavour of this delightful cake that I made one substitution for with pure cane sugar instead of honey which does not alter the final results of the cake
599450,338256,9/13/2009,4,"We loved this. Very quick to put together and the hint of red pepper sauce was perfect! Thanks, cookiemakin'mama! Made for PAC Fall 2009."
1931808,338256,12/28/2012,0,"Very simple to make, very colorful and pleasant to look at. I addd a cup of yellow onions and a tbl spoon of minced garlic."
303109,438978,6/29/2011,5,I thought this was really good and fresh tasting.
2001346860,471641,1/11/2017,0,Great looking recipe/ vegan- no animal products including honey.
1803266070,507226,10/25/2014,5,Love it !   Will make this again.
2000496795,507226,9/25/2015,0,"This is the best butternut squash recipe ever, but it is even better by adding a teaspoon of allspice at the same time the half and half is added. Will make again soon!"
2001028411,507226,5/28/2016,5,So easy and never fails!! I add a little more stock and I have used just pumpkin before - equally as good!
136997,523426,7/17/2016,5,My husband says this is a keeper. Easy to prepare and took less than an hour.
95743,16127,5/23/2004,5,"Impressive and delicious if it's not cooked until it turns grey and soggy.  Looks like a lot more work than it really is.  It's easy to put together even if it may sound a bit confusing when you read the directions.  Just follow them and it will work out beautifully.  The dressing was a bit tart for our tastes but a light sprinkle of Splenda fixed that.  This will definitely be at my next dinner party as it can easily be prepared for cooking well in advance.  Thanks, s'kat."
21752,166852,3/26/2007,4,"This was actually pretty good, and I don't even like okra!  I made up for that by adding another onion to the mix, and also adding some coarse-ground Hungarian paprika.  I have to put paprika in everything.  We actually had this for breakfast, with crusty rolls, lots of sweet butter and spicy matbucha (a Middle Eastern salsa).  Thanks for the cross-cultural experience, Potts!"
171084,166852,6/10/2007,5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this! We've fixed fried taters & onions for years but I never thought about adding okra. Served this with fried pork chops and made cream gravy from the drippings. Oh Potsie...what have you done?? :)"
2324285,166852,12/11/2012,5,"This was tasty potato dish that reminded me of the potatoes my dad used to make.  He didn't use okra though, as we only just recently started getting okra in stores in Chicago.      I've gotten addicted to okra, so I think next time I might even double the amount.  I also didn't use any gravy or ketchup, as it's flavorful enough as is.  Thanks for sharing."
424680,175614,6/9/2008,5,"I cut back on the amount of red pepper, but otherwise included the ingredients listed & had a very nice side dish! I particularly enjoyed it on thick slices of multigrain bread! Thanks for sharing! [Made & reviewed while on tour in Eastern Europe during the Zaar World Tour 4]"
837251,175614,6/18/2008,4,"This was nice. I'm going to try it on some bread tomorrow, that seems delish to me.
The longer you leave it, the better the flavors. I followed the recipe except for the vinegar, i used balsamico. Made for the Tastebud Tickling Travellers, ZWT4"
428885,229794,6/4/2007,5,"Made this for lunch, and let me tell you, if I could, I could eat this everyday. Happened to have chutney that needed using up, and had everything else on hand too. The bacon and shaved smoked salmon  coupled with the onion and cream cheese and chives just make an absolute terrific sandwich! I can see that you can also serve this on toast points and maybe the addition of cucumber too. Thanks so much English Rose! ZWT3 07'"
128473,229794,5/3/2010,5,What a great sandwich.  I adored all the flavors and textures in this treat.  The mango chutney was a real nice addition.  I will be making these again often.  Thanks for sharing :)
286566,229794,10/19/2013,5,"One of the best open sandwiches I have had just loved the whole lot though would like to try it toasting the bread otherwise would not make any changes whatsoever thank you English_Rose, made for Name that Ingredient tag game."
622371,264085,11/8/2007,4,"Originally this recipe contained a partial list of the directions, but after reviewing my email to Diane, she revised them and I retried this...It was ""FEN""tastic!!  Thank you sooo much for aditing it...it turned out wonderful!!"
1658850,296647,11/2/2010,5,"Definitely addictive! I would shrink the recipe down next time. I used the biggest bowl I had and it still wasn't big enough (I used 3 cups of each cereal). I also ended up having to add more almond bark (I used candy melt that I flavored with vanilla...and when I added the vanilla it seized the melts on the first batch). In total, I used 16 oz   12 oz of candy melts, for a total of 28 oz. More wouldn't hurt, since some of the cereal pieces didn't get coated. Still addictive! I've grabbed 2 handfuls during this review! Thanks for the recipe! I could see this becoming a tradition around here!"
2002329856,363765,11/12/2018,5,"These are amazing! I was super nervous about the ratio of oatmeal and flour to wet ingredients, but they were so great! I was also scared about the recipe not having eggs, which turned out to not be a problem. I did also added: a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cooking wet ingredients, a smidge more shortening, replumped my fried cranberries in the microwave, and replaced the 1/3 cup of flour with flax meal. It worked out great, because, flax meal seems to be a greedier dry ingredient when it comes to soaking up liquids. I love these cookies! So great! New favorite, thank you for sharing this recipe!!"
452940,367080,7/10/2009,4,"Your right, we had to add quite a bit more apple juice, but it's a good cocktail that does taste a bit like apple brandy. Thanks for sharing the recipe. :)"
162826,367080,10/4/2009,5,"WOW!
This is tasty, Boomie! I used exactly the ingredients as listed. YUMMO.

424680,383271,8/31/2009,5,"Don't know if I changed the taste or texture of this cornbread, but I used a reduced-fat buttermilk as well as a no-sodium salt, but other than that the recipe was followed (well, I was generous with the half cup of corn!) & we had A GREAT TASTING CORNBREAD! Certainly a recipe I want to keep around ~ Thanks for sharing it! [Tagged, made & reviewed in Newest Zaar recipe tag]"
204024,383271,11/26/2009,5,"An essential Thanksgiving ingredient for us.  We always make my mother's recipe for cornbread dressing.  This was a very fun and different type of cornbread.I had never used white corn, buttermilk, and actual corn in my cornbread. Also I loved making it in my cast iron skillet. It did not disappoint.
This is a much more dense and heavy  cornbread than we are used to.  Ours was a little underdone in the center so others should check carefully to make sure it is done.  Thank you for a fun experience, breezermom.  Made for Holiday PRMR."
573325,383271,12/19/2009,4,"This is a dense and filling cornbread with a great crust and yummy sweetish taste!
It was very easy to put together, but in the end needed way longer to cook through for me (about 65 minutes). That might have been due to me using a bundt cake pan instead of a skillet, though.
I luved the addition of corn in this and found the white cornmeal to be an interesting change.
THANKS SO MUCH for sharing this lovely recipe with us, Breezer!"
17803,383271,5/10/2010,5,"I had white cornmeal on hand so was glad to find this recipe.  I used a 10"" case iron skillet (1 3/4"" deep) to pour the batter in.  The pan was to small for all the batter, so I had a bit of a mess to clean up off the table, mostly the oil.   I could have used a cake pan but wanted to stick with the directions.  There was very little batter that baked over the pan in the oven.  It was crisp on the outside with a slightly sweet flavor.  I'll be making this again.  Made for *1 2 3 Hits  Its Not Easy Being Green  March 2010* (in May,  as I was late)"
1783373,383271,5/16/2014,5,"Very nice cornbread.  So easy to make too.  Made it to accompany &quot;Recipe #495413&quot; and it was just wonderful.  This bread is good too toasted in the morning with a slather of butter over the top.  Found that the white cornflour made it light and airy.  I grew up on Portuguese cornbread which is normally made with white cornflour.  Though it is quite different from what I grew up on, I found this recipe to be airier and delightful.  Thank you breezermom for sharing."
1605636,418935,4/28/2010,5,Love this recipe! I make it for my daughter as an after school snack and she loves it. It keeps her going until dinnertime.
60124,483275,10/5/2012,5,"these were really good! did 2 large potatoes, (for 2) and used all the curry.<br/>They looked good, and tasted great. served with fish. made (late) for Aussie swap spet 2012"
369715,507198,10/15/2013,3,This was good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written other then I used beef broth instead of water. This was a meaty and beany chili that but it  was missing something for us.
4470,64124,5/18/2004,5," This glaze is wonderful!  The meat was moist and after 35 minutes it was ready for the glaze then 10  more uncovered In fact it is so good that I am making another small batch of glaze and use it on the piece of tenderloin that I had left over.  I will slice the tenderloin into medalions, cover them with foil , heat for 10 min in 350F oven uncover and paint the medallions with the glaze. This will really saturate the flavor into the pork. Loved the flavor and the color is worth a picture.  Thanks Zenith for an easy tasty recipe"
129958,64124,5/25/2004,4,"A very easy, moist and tender pork loin.  I had never cooked a pork loin before, now I am a big fan of it.  DH and I did not care for the flavor of the glaze, however it would be very easy to adjust the flavor to our personal tastes and will definitely try this again."
283251,64124,3/20/2006,4,This was fabulous! I used the zest and juice of a whole orange and put it on the roast when I put it in the oven. The flavor sank into the meat. YUM! The only thing I would do differently next time is to add less allspice (I don't measure anything) because I added just a little too much.
726381,232036,1/13/2008,0,nothing authentic here ..
321078,232037,7/19/2008,5,"A little spicy for my daughter, but that's easily adjusted. Anything from Cook's Illustrated is always a winner! Thanks for posting.
P.S: I was a little freaked out by the clam juice, but the end result wasn't weird at all!"
1115621,232037,4/23/2009,5,"My hard-to-please hubby said ""mmm-good!""  I will definitely put this dish in the permanent file. It has excellent flavor, even with the changes I made based on what was on hand: pre-cooked chicken andouille sausage, pre-cooked large shrimp, and orzo instead of rice.  Preparation was necessarily different as a result:  the (frozen, left-over) orzo was thawed in a separate pot with doses of chicken broth to keep it from sticking and turning to mush.  I cannot eat clams so I substituted chicken broth. The shrimp and sausage were put in together, closely followed by the processed vegies and remaining ingredients.  Because no rice was added I skipped the water and added only a shot of chicken broth to the jambalaya.  I served the stew over orzo rather than mixed in with it.  Rice would have been a more traditional taste but it was excellent anyway!"
911978,232037,9/6/2011,5,This is a winner! Everybody loved it. The only change I made was using cilantro instead of parsley. I had some reservations about clam juice but it melted into the overall great flavor. Thanks for posting.
474322,232039,6/21/2007,5,"We liked this rub a lot! It's best described as ""bright"", I think due to the lemon peel. I have added this to my list of things to make for gifts. I have used it on salmon, and on boneless chicken thighs. Thanks!"
107583,232039,6/23/2007,5,"What a nice flavor this gives chicken!  I used it under the skin on a whole roast chicken.  Will try it on salmon soon!  (I used chopped fresh rosemary, since I have it growing in the yard.)"
33159,232039,3/24/2008,5,"Delicious!!  I used this rub on boneless, skinless chicken breasts & then grilled.  I was a little skeptical about a 15 minute room temperature marinade but it was perfect.  Very lemony but not too much!!"
129958,232039,10/14/2008,5,"Wow, I just noticed that I had not posted my review of this rub!  I apologize.  I have used it quite a bit on chicken and fish and it is always a hit.  I love simple rubs with ingredients that I keep on hand.  I can whip this up in a few moments and make simple chicken, etc taste special.  Thanks Cookin Mommy!"
1072593,232039,7/14/2012,5,"I learned how to cook at my mom's side.  I was the only 3rd grader I knew who could accurately identify by smell any given herb.  Okay, I was the ONLY 3rd grader ANYBODY knew to accurately do that.  Great on chicken."

We loved this omelet,Peter!!
It was so simple to put together and I love how you can pour it in the pan and walkaway till its cooked!No fiddling, awesome!I did use green onions in place of the chives but I think your recipe can be altered to ones taste very easily.
Thanks so much for the recipe."
278118,232041,12/2/2008,5,A very tasty breakfast!  I did take a picture but Lorrie's picture is MUCH better than mine.  My omelette fell apart a little when removing it from the pan I made it in.  I love this recipe as it is so versatile!  Next time I will make this in the traditional flipping over omelette style that I like so much.  Made for the December NZ/Aussie recipe swap.
133174,232041,12/7/2008,5,"This reminded me more of a frittata than an omelet.  It is very easy to prepare and lends itself to many variations.  I loved that it required minimal tending to while cooking.  While writing the review, I realized that I had left off the cheese.  I do think that some Canadian bacon would be delicious with this."
329769,232041,8/7/2009,5,*Reviewed for Aussie NZ Forum Recipe Swap August 2009* This was so easy to make and very filling. More like a frittata in that it contained the potato and wasn't flipped. I think mine cooked a little quicker but perhaps due to the pan size. I had worried about the potato cooking....but it was perfect. Thanks Peter- I really enjoyed the omelette. Photo also to be posted
37449,232041,11/3/2009,5,my husband and I both enjoyed this yummy omelette! I did saute the potato and mushrooms before putting on top of the omelette. Thanks Peter! Made for the Australian Recipes Swap-Nov. 2009.
593927,232041,3/7/2010,5,This was delicious. I did have to sub haloumi cheese for the cheddar and though they are nothing alike it was wonderful. I made this in my cast iron frying pan with a little canola oil. I will make this again with cheddar. Made for RECIPE SWAP #38 - March 2010 - Group 2 - Iced Vo Vo's.
11297,232041,4/4/2010,5,"Very easy to make and no fiddling as someone else said :)  Made as listed this time but think other ingredients such as red pepper, spring onions and even ham could also be used or added.  Thanks for a such a versatile recipe. :)"
339260,232041,5/10/2011,5,"Wonderful omelet recipe.  I used Egg Beaters egg substitute.  I also ""baked"" the potato in the microwave, sliced and fried it.  I sauteed the mushroom as well before topping the omelet.  I foldedthe omelet over to give it more of an omelet shape.  This omelet had the perfect combination of flavors.  I can't wait to make it again.  Made for May 2011 Aus/NZ Swap and Honor thy Mother - and be Gluten-Free, too! Tag Game."
286566,232041,11/9/2011,5,"A very filling and satisfying breakfast, thank you Peter J, made for Aussie/Kiwi recipe wap, November 2011."
482376,232041,12/12/2011,5,"Excellent omelette! I omitted the potato since I am doing a no-carb week. I can't wait to try it with the potato! Also, I didn't have mushrooms so I subbed in onions. I really like the method and think you could use the same method and change up the ingredients very easily. Thank you for a great breakfast! Made for the Aussie/NZ Swap and the PARTY event."
582561,232041,2/4/2012,5,A delicious and substantial way to start they day.  Made for Aussie / Kiwi Swap Feb 2012.
498271,232041,5/1/2012,5,"This is a hearty and tasty omelette!  Loved the potato and the fact that it was grated instead of in cubes.  Left out the chives, otherwise made as directed and really enjoyed - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
780172,232041,8/23/2012,5,"This is a very good omelet, I enjoyed the addition of mushrooms and tomatoes. I like when potatoes are added to omelets, it is like a full meal then. I can not have cheese so mine was made minus cheese and it still was very nice."
128473,232041,11/26/2012,5,"Frittata or Omelette by whichever name is delicious.  Quick and easy to make, filling and satisfying, great flavors and wonderful texture.  Made exactly as written, wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks so much for sharing."
239758,232041,5/10/2014,5,"What a great omelet. I used a leftover baked potato, half of a largish tomato and 4 small mushrooms. The light spray of cooking oil didn&#039;t really do the job on my worn-out non-stick pan, which is why the pic looks like I had to dig the omelet out of the pan. After that I did what any upstanding Nebraska girl would do to an omelet with cheese -- I added some ketchup. Yum, yum! Thanks for posting."
403396,232042,6/28/2007,5,"Very, very good!  Saved us a bit of money, too, as my son is quite fond of L&L's chicken katsu.  I made it exactly as described and put it in a styrofoam takeout box before nonchalantly tossing it on the table.  He was definitely fooled and only looked suspicious when he realized I hadn't left the house!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  It is definitely staying in my permanent file."
92886,232042,8/9/2007,3,"Pretty good.  I found the sauce too sweet for my tastes, but if I cut back on the ketchup and sugar I think I would like it even more.  The chicken turned out nice and lightly crispy.  Made me think of schnitzel."
456455,232042,11/14/2007,4,"Husband says this is a keeper! Quick, easy and tasy too."
375776,232042,3/12/2009,5,"Yummy!My son,who is very picky,loved this.He loves crumbed chicken and I was very surprised when he liked the Katsu sauce.Will be making this again,thank you!Additional note,I have found it's easy to freeze in ice cube trays and then transfer them to a container."
1327837,232042,2/18/2010,5,made this for my wife and what a treat. i am a truck driver and stumbled across l.l. close to one of my stops was very pleased with the texture and taste told my wife she needs to taste this chicken stuff i had found started looking aroundand found this what a great recipe if nbot as good as L.L. better all my kids now hve it in there favorite box iron woman i woulk hiss you for this thanks    papa bob
1568184,232042,3/3/2010,5,I love this recipe!  Its really easy to make and the Panko makes the chicken taste so crunchy and crispy!  Goes great paired with Hawaiian Macaroni Salad
349461,232042,1/24/2011,5,"I made this recipe in Wisconsin on a day that the temperature outside was in the single digits, and it brought back memories of eating 'plate lunch' on Oahu when I was in the Navy. I loved this recipe, and it tasted just like I remember. I didn't have any chicken breasts, but I used pork instead, and it was delicious."
1024930,232042,6/18/2011,5,"Ok, so this recipe (for me) get the 5 stars JUST for the sauce. We had L&L for dinner the other day, and my boyfried who is NOTORIOUSLY BAD at screwing up directions, orderd REGULAR portions for me AND my 6 yr old daughter, and only got 1 thing of sauce!!!  needless to say, my daughter and i could have SPLIT just ONE of the generouse portions and had leftovers... so I had A LOT of leftovers!  BUT NO SUACE!!!  i googled ' L&L Katsu sauce recipe""  and this came up. I made it, and its tastes pretty much SPOT ON to L&L!!!!  major props!!!"
1975031,232042,8/8/2011,5,AWESOME. Trying brown sugar instead of granulated next time to see if it makes a difference in taste. This recipe is right on the money though! Try it!
2780901,232042,4/17/2013,5,Awesome recipe.  Made it for dinner and everyone loved it.
921361,232042,10/3/2014,0,Tasted great and was super easy to make. Thanks for the recipe!
2001039822,232042,6/6/2016,5,"Very simple recipe, easy to follow. Only trouble I had was the process of making the sauce. Other than that everything was perfect! I also went and used macaroni salad as a side!"
2001615771,232042,7/6/2017,5,"Thanks so much for this recipe! My son and I have been going to Hawaii for last few years but not this year. He's addicted to L&amp;L Hawaiian BBQ's Chicken Katsu. We're from Michigan and don't have them here. Went out West this year and he managed to find an L&amp;L in Portland, OR, 30 miles out of our way in 100&deg; heat. Made this tonight and he was over the moon! Used organic chicken breasts, pounced down and soaked in buttermilk to tenderize. The guy from the Portland L&amp;L mentioned using a 1/2 brown/white sugar mixture, which kept sauce from being too sweet. Only issue I had was some of the coating was coming off on last batch. I used jumbo eggs, which is what I had on hand, so batter was a little thin. Served with scoop of jasmine rice and Mac salad I had leftover from 4th of July party."
160974,232044,10/3/2007,5,"I couldn't resist even though it is fall! I was able to find pretty good nectarines so it was fine. This is so intensely fruity and refreshing. I love the fresh fruit chunks. Delicious with/without Cool Whip. I used four dessert glasses and the rest fit (to the top) of a 9 inch square pan. Thanks Tammi, for another great recipe.

1024982,232045,4/22/2009,5,Sounds like the real thing!
2001454217,232046,7/12/2018,4,Salad was awesome. I also added parsley for freshness. great meal added to my nutrition plan.
200862,382149,3/2/2011,3,"MADE FOR PAC, March 2011. Dear AskCy, this recipe is very hard for me to review. As my adopted cook, I'd love to give you 5 stars for every recipe!! This one made it to ""good"" (3 stars). It is perfectly nice, very easy, real comfort food, but the taste is very ordinary. Normally I would have added lots of herbs and maybe chillies, but I wanted us to taste your recipe as you wrote it. AskCy, maybe my biggest problem is with your cooking method, and I wonder if you'd consider editing your recipe? The litre of beef stock would have been FAR too much: I added 1 cup! (250 ml). (Did you make a mistake with that litre?) In the photos you can hopefully see 250 ml was enough, as the veggies also shed some liquid. I also have a problem with your cooking times. No ways could I cook this dish, after adding the peas, ""for a good hour""!! I added the peas once the baby potatoes was almost tender, and it took literally minutes for the peas and potatoes to be perfect after that, and I removed it from the heat. A small point, but maybe worth mentioning for the 5-star recipes you are still going to post for us: list your ingredients in the order in which they will be used, i.e. oil first. The title: it puzzled me a little (this is not a criticism!) as we would never call a mince dish a ""stew"". One associates a stew with chunks of meat. But never mind that. Also, this dish, with rice and sides, will feed at least 4 - 6 hungry people! Very economical in these times. Thank you, AskCy, and please post more of your recipes!"
166642,232049,11/10/2007,5,"These are outstanding! We just loved them - great flavor and easy to make! I did serve them with chicken, just not barbecue, but they were delicious. No leftovers! Thanks!"
430471,232049,12/10/2007,5,So good and easy the only thing I thought was missing was some cheese. Maybe next time I'll add some. Served with chilli. YUMMY!
527607,232049,2/2/2008,5,"Outstanding.  I was non traditional and served them with sour cream (low fat) lol

easy and delicious, a great lunch"
337963,232049,4/28/2008,4,"What a fun recipe!  I served them with sticky fingers and a tomato salad.  We weren't quite sure how to serve them, so I topped mine with sour cream and more green onion, and for hubby I served drizzled with a bit of molasses instead.  The best thing about this recipe is that you can serve a ""bread"" side with dinner that's made from scratch and is super quick.  Thanks for posting Paula, made for PAC.  Please see my rating system as I rate tougher than most."
837152,232049,5/15/2008,5,Had along with fried chicken and we woofed them down in no time!  We put butter on ours.
128473,232049,4/19/2010,5,"Another tasty treat from Paula.  Wow, were these good.  I had never tried them before, so wasn't sure what to expect.  A lovely light tasting pancake with an awesome flavor.  These were incredible served plain with recipe #283235 and steamed rice.  They really were excellent, they sopped up the tasty gravy beautifully, even my picky dh had two.  Into my keeper box this goes, can't wait to try it with BBQ chicken and crispy pork.  Thank you so much for sharing.  Made for Pac 2010 :)"
174096,232049,4/25/2010,5,"Delicious!  We loved how it got a nice crispy outside, with a good flavor, and a light texture.  I drizzled ours with honey just before serving.  It made a great brunch with Recipe #310625.  Thanks for sharing!"
339260,232049,2/18/2011,5,"I think this makes a delicious side to almost any meal.  These hoecakes were easy to whip up and cook on the griddle.  They were light and delicious.  I ate some with just butter and some with honey...both were yummy!  The green onion was a nice touch.  I think they would be really good with some green chiles also.  Thanks for another great recipe, PaulaG.  Made for Best of 2010 Cookbooks Tag Game."
1531249,232049,7/20/2012,4,"These tasted delicious.  However, I had some difficulty flipping them because they were so fragile.  I finally switched from my cast iron skillet to a nonstick pan, with better results."
781390,232051,4/22/2008,5,"Very good, followed recipe and turned out delicious."
39334,232053,2/10/2008,5,"These were so good!!! We planned on making bone-in breasts, but after realizing all I had was boneless breasts, I decided to use this recipe. And I am so glad I did! The only thing I did differently was to put the chicken on a rack on a cookie sheet to keep the bottoms from getting soggy. But the cornflakes made for a crispy coating and the seasoning was delicious!!! Thanks for posting such a yummy, delicious recipe...I can't wait to try it with tenders for chicken strips...yum!"
610843,232054,1/10/2008,5,"My mom found this recipe in a magazine many years ago and it was passed on to me when I got married. This is one of my families most favorite meals. I usually don't have olives but the taste is still great. I have also used Jiffy corn muffin mix for the crust. It is a sweeter crust than I prefer, but makes this recipe a quick fix dinner. Fat-free refried beans help cut down on calories and does not affect the taste. I also use turkey burger instead of ground beef."
36128,45732,1/7/2003,5,"I am so grateful for this recipe.  It is hard getting my family to love eggplant as I do, so I wanted to try this one, cuz it sounded so yummy!  This was an over all winner with everyone here.  My son loved it, and my hubby too!  I think he went backe for 4ths.  LOL  I made it with shredded mozza since I didnt have a block of cheese to cut!  THanks for a great side dish!!!"
59064,50181,1/24/2003,5,"Yum! something this quick should not taste so good and be so healthy. Even people who don't like tofu should like this one and it is a great way of using nutritional yeast.
I made a few minor changes using grapeseed oil, ketjap manis, lime juice and wholegrain mustard because that's what I had in the house. It's a great recipe for those days when you don't want to cook at all and want something light but substantial."
46545,50181,2/26/2003,5,"Wonderful sauce for pasta, veggies, rice, maybe even a baked potato!  I used 1/2 C water and dissolved 1 large veg bouillon cube in it for the vegetable stock.  This gives it even more flavor.  Also, I used a little less oil to save a few fat calories.   "
140331,50181,4/7/2005,5,Where has this recipe been all my life?  It's too good to pass up.  I had it on noodles and then again on rice and then again over rice and veggies.  Love it.Thanks!
277855,50181,12/27/2005,5,"I loved this and so did the non-vegetarians I served it to.
"
163214,50181,4/13/2006,5,My whole family loved this sauce. I heated it and served it over rotini pasta. I will definitely make this again. Thanks! 
91724,50181,8/11/2007,5,"This is so good and it's good on so many things, as others have mentioned. I heated it and served it over angel hair pasta and vegetables and it's the kind of thing you can't stop eating. My one year old grandson loved it.  Doesn't matter if you don't like tofu; it doesn't taste like tofu."
85730,50181,2/10/2011,5,"This was different from other pasta sauces I've had or made, but it was tasty. No one will know there's tofu in it unless you tell them, and it's got a whole lot more protein than your average pasta sauce. We enjoyed it over Barilla Plus penne and steamed broccoli."
68460,54550,3/22/2003,5,"Another good recipe!  I made this exactly as written using 1 pound of white button mushrooms and 1/2 pound baby portobellos.  This soup has a rich, earthy flavor and smells wonderful while it's cooking.  It was the perfect meal for us on the cold, rainy day we were having.  I served it with Caesar salad and hot rolls.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe, it's going into my permanent recipe file!"
65056,54550,11/20/2003,5,"I made this as part of the Comfort Food Cook-a-thon and I'm so glad I did!  My boyfriend decided this is his new favorite soup (and I make a lot of soups) and ate a bowl of it with breakfast, lunch and dinner until it was gone.  I made it a week (or more) ago and he's been bothering me every day to make more!  I dodn't have any bay leaves, so I used some thyme and other spices to taste.  I used a mix of white button and crimini (these are the same thing as baby portobello, by the way, for those who don't know).  I also used one small-medium unpeeled russet potato.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  This tastes completely gormet and really isn't much work, less slicing all the mushrooms.  I know I'll be making this again (by BF demands it!)  Thanks so much for posting."
80353,54550,1/3/2004,5,"Truly delicious and so easy to make!  I used a combination of button mushrooms and oyster mushrooms (no portobella here today) and the flavour was outstanding.  Soothing, satisfying, and the barley added just the right touch of toothsomeness.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that goes in the keeper file!"
123640,54550,3/7/2004,5,"This recipe was very well received at our house.  I thought it was a good, tasty soup, but my husband and a visiting friend practically inhaled it, and hubby has been demanding it ever since.  I made the recipe as-is the first time, and added 1/2 tsp thyme after that."
116315,54550,5/21/2004,5,"Like the other reviews, a very good soup, it smelt so delicious and was too.  I added about 2 tbsp. of sour cream to each bowl full and this was what I was missing in my personal taste."
37779,54550,12/20/2004,5,This is a very soul-soothing delicious soup. We are just starting to get bitter cold weather here and I am so glad I had this soup to enjoy. I used a combo of baby bellas and button mushrooms. I made no alterations and the flavor and smell were excellent. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Will make again.
246898,54550,10/2/2005,5,My mother says this is the best mushroom barley soup she has ever had. I put some in the freezer to save and she took it back out to serve to company. I added some additional barley and I simmered the soup for an hour. Will be making this often.
108902,54550,10/30/2005,5,"Wow. This is sooo amazing. It took me a little longer than I expected with all the chopping of vegetables, but it was worth it. I didn't have barley, so I used Instant Brown Rice. I'll be making this often. Thanks!"
223325,54550,11/3/2005,4,"A very tasty and enjoyable dish, but I think you might consider it more of a stew than a soup. Either way it was delicious!!"
278207,54550,1/1/2006,5,"This soup reminded me of the traditional mushroom soup my family made every Christmas Eve, only with more butter and minus the carrots and potato.  It took me forever to cut up all the veggies because I'm not a good cook.  Regardless, this soup turned out delicious.  I still can't believe I made something so good."
39835,54550,2/13/2006,4,Very good soup which we enjoyed with popoovers. Instead of the chicken broth I used half chicken broth and half vegetable broth--next time I think I'll use all vegetable broth to make it a vegetarian soup. Thanks for sharing!
62043,54550,10/10/2006,5,"This was an extremely delicious barley soup. The addition of portobella mushrooms added a meaty, woodsy taste that was very appealing. I will definately make this again. Thanks!"
362983,54550,1/2/2007,4,"Great soup. Very easy to make and it was hearty and delicious. I added lots of herbs to the soup, though I would probably add some seasonings when sauteeing the vegetables to add some more flavour to them in the soup since they seemed a little bland to me with just butter. Still, very yummy!"
208125,54550,11/1/2007,5,"Very delicious, the mushroom flavour wasn't drowned out by the other ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly and we thought that it didn't really need the potato but the soup would be great either way."
203111,54550,11/4/2007,3,"This is one of those soups that shouldn't be served until the next day, IMO.  It was ok the first day but I had my doubts about making it again because it takes so long to cut up all the vegs.  But I decided it was all well worth it when I had a bowl the next day. Yum! I did add about 1/4 cup of cream to it."
149075,54550,5/20/2009,5,"a lovely, nourishing soup. I only used half the butter, and just a little oil to saute the veggies. I added a touch of sherry towards the end to enhance the nutty flavor of  the different mushrooms I used. The family loved this soup."
206213,54550,6/24/2009,4,"I made this soup yesterday, with adjusted menu for 4 people - DH dislikes too much barley :>( doesn't know what's good for him!
I have to say I wasn't overly impressed with the initial flavour, so added some good frozen(then defrosted) chicken stock to it. Today I reheated it and felt the flavour had much improved. I really enjoyed it -- DH said- less barley and more potato -- I disagree as I love barley. I don't know that it will be a regular on  our soup menu, but I'll will have it again - for me!!! Thank you BoxO'Wine because I love soup and it's always  good to have a go at something different from the norm :>)"
234075,54550,1/3/2010,5,"Very good. I used olive oil instead of butter, and added about a tsp dried thyme, little bit of rosemary, and finished it with a generous dollop of chardonnay. The next day, the flavor had become rich and full bodied. Thanks for posting. I will make this again!"
545970,54550,1/23/2011,3,"I liked this and it was better the 2nd day.  I'm only giving 3 stars because no one else in the family would eat it, even the mushroom lovers.  If I were to make this again, I would chop all the mushrooms (instead of the slicing) and double the barley."
744367,54550,1/25/2011,0,"This soup was delicious. i only made a couple changes.  I used one can of beef broth, one can of chicken broth and 2 cans of vegetable broth. I also used salted butter since thats what i had on hand. I sliced some shitake and baby portebellos too to add to the mix, they were a delicious addition.  I am giving it 5 stars and would give it more if i could because it was my 11 and 7 year old that ate ALL of the soup!  I had a bowl before i napped before my 3rd shift job, and when i awoke, looking forward to bringing a bowl to work with me, it was GONE!!  DH told me that they each had 2 helpings for dinner, and the kids begged for more later till they finished it!  Needless to say, im on my way to the store after writing this review, to get some more mushrooms to make a double recipe for tonights dinner :)  oh, let me add that i also left out the potato"
1991003,54550,4/5/2012,5,I have put this soup into my new healthy menu rotation.  It is delicious.  I used beef broth cubes and cut the amount by 50% to help reduce the sodium level.  Thank you for sharing this healthful recipe!
53156,54955,3/21/2003,5,"This cake was easy and really yummy! I do a lot of ""high end"" baking normally. Genoise, etc. But this time I needed a quick cake and this fits the bill. Wonderfully moist and flavorful."
50711,54955,6/4/2006,3,"My DH is a chocoholic so this recipe sounded right up his alley.  While it was very easy to make, and it was moist and tasted ok, I didn't think it had much chocolate flavor.  If I make again I will add more melted chocolate and see if that helps.  Thanks for posting this Elaine."
198154,54955,7/16/2014,5,"I&#039;m typically not a fan of the texture of buttermilk cakes. But I had buttermilk that I needed to use up and I needed to make a cake for my in laws anniversary.  The other thing that made me a little hesitant was the nutmeg. A lot of recipes add cinnamon to their chocolate cake and I don&#039;t care for it.  This cake however, had good texture and great flavor! The only thing I would suggest is to check your cake. Mine was finished with more than five minutes left on the timer.   I topped this with a chocolate fudge buttercream frosting. Yum!"
55380,76657,7/5/2004,4,"Thanks, Shelly! The fridge died and I was left with all the meat thawed, including a brisket, and none of the condiments I usually use. This saved the brisket! I've never used Liquid Smoke for this cut before, although I had some in the cabinet for summer sausage. I'd wondered when it made such a small amount but trusted your note in the recipe and you're right! I ended up marinading it for almost 24 hrs and then cooked it in the crockpot. It was very flavorful - tangy and smoky - and I have a feeling the leftovers would have been even moreso...if there had been any! ;o) I'm not sure it will replace our main recipe, but we now have the perfect backup. A definite 4.5 stars!"
6357,98783,9/1/2004,5,This was incredibly truly so yummy that my dad has requested me to make it every alternate weekend for dessert!! Truly a keeper:) Thank you very much for sharing! 
141042,98783,9/7/2004,5,"Just delicious fudgy fudge.  This was enjoyed by young and old alike.  I added chopped nuts and an additional drop of orange extract, as my grated orange zest fell a little short of the two teaspoons the recipe calls for.  I'm going to try the mint too!  Thank you for posting!"
130970,98783,11/21/2004,5,"This recipe is so simple and good. I made 2 batches today, one with orange zest and Cointreau, the other one with Chambord, and instead of pecan (the only kind of nut I don't like too much), I added chopped walnut and almond. Turns out very well. This will definitely be one item in my xmas gifts."
98063,98783,2/18/2005,5,"I've made this about five times already and keep forgetting to review it. It is yummy and beautifully simple to make. I never used the pecans, but did add a tsp of orange extract. I'll have to try the other variations some time, but I just keep making this one because it is so good."
138861,98783,3/19/2005,5,"YUM!!! This was so good that we ate almost the whole batch in one night. I did have a bit of trouble initially trying to get the chocolate and condensed milk to melt and smoothen but I think it was because I had the double boiler on too high of a temperature. Oh well, the taste was still the best, and it was so simple to put it together. I will definately be making this again."
206722,98783,6/3/2005,5,"This was wonderful, and SO easy to make. It came out beautifully....put a smile on all our faces!"
39194,98783,12/26/2005,5,"I was very glad I tried this fudge!  It was quite easy to make, and although I did use orange extract (3 drops), it came out wonderful.  I am going to experiment with other flavors as well.  Thank you Marg! :)"
55380,98783,12/27/2005,5,"This was simple enough that my 10 yr old could do it on her own, but definitely good enough to give for gifts. The first time we used grated orange peel (the kind in a jar in the spice aisle) and the orange flavor was barely discernable. The next time we tried fresh orange zest and it was better. I have some orange extract and we'll try adding a dash of that next time, since we're all huge chocolate-orange fiends and like the stronger flavor combo. Orange taste or not, this is a simple but very good fudge, very smooth and not overly sweet (we used a combination of semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips). We haven't tried the pecans yet but I'm sure one of these times we'll toss them in as well. Thanks so much for posting! "
280238,98783,1/2/2006,5,"I made two different fudge recipes for Christmas this year.  The first go-round  the fudge was made from scratch and was tedious to make. My family loved it and It turned out nice and creamy.  Then I made this recipe.  Wow..my family LOVED it and our friends begged for more. They raved about how the fudge just melted in your mouth with rich chocolaty flavor - then the orange kicked in! Sort of a one-two punch of tasty delight! I made lots of it for Christmas gifts and I cut it into big hunks, wrapped it in plastic wrap, put a beautiful ribbon around it and included a clear plastic knife for cutting off your own pieces.  It was fudge to be proud of.  From now on, this is the fudge I'll be making for gift giving.  Quick and easy. What could be better?  Oh yeah...don't forget the walnuts!  Yum!  Thanks Marg for submitting this wonderful recipe."
14112,98783,1/4/2006,5,"This fudge is delicious!  I have never made fudge before.  I've always been too scared to try.  This seemed easy enough, and it was!  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for a great recipe."
102058,98783,2/1/2006,5,"I made this without the nuts too... Wonderful ! Smooth, and deceptive... it sets very solid, so I was a bit worried, but cuts easily with a decent amount of pressure (I didn't break my hand doing it) and it was still melt in your mouth soft once you took a piece or ..um... 4 !!! Our family aren't fans of orange peel so I used two teaspoons of orange essence... could have been a bit stronger for our taste at least 'cos the orange was only a vague after-taste of orange instead of a more predominant flavour (which DH really likes) I'm itching to make this with the peppermint in it and might even try a mix with some Tia Maria one time or Bailies ?... this will be my recipe of choice when DD's school asks for bake sale things for fundraising since it's just embarrasingly easy and fast to make and you just know that kids will leave telling you that they need something until the evening before... Now, no stress, I will have this recipe on hand to whip up and save the day :) Please see my rating system, an excellently deserved 5 stars! Thanks !
UPDATE: I've made this 4 times recently and I added 3 Tablespoons of peppermint essence to get the strength that's perfect for us. Mint is the prefered flavour here so far... this stuff practically walks off the plate when you have guests, so I'll be making this often in the future. Thanks !"
202661,98783,2/2/2006,5,"My fudge of choice.  I have made this recipe dozens of times over the past ten years.  Everyone is correct that it disappears.  I bring the ingredients to work and and make in my microwave I have there.  It amazes everyone to see it made.  For gifts I cut it into squares and roll those into truffle balls then roll in or sprinkle with cocoa powder.  It makes a very elegant gift that way. I use 3 - 4 drops of Orange Oil by Nature's Flavors when I am making orange fudge, but Nature's Flavors has so many wonderful oil concentrates the possibilities are endless.  Please try this fudge.  You'll never make another."
234222,98783,2/2/2006,5,Wow - this fudge is wonderful!  What could be better than an easy recipe with great results?!  I used pure orange extract instead of the orange zest and it turned out great!  Thanks for sharing - will make again!
144431,98783,4/25/2006,5,"Wonderful and so easy!  I halved the recipe, but used the full amount of orange zest and added about 1 teaspoon of Triple Sec.  After chilling, I rolled into truffles and then in cocoa powder.  Served on a bed of mini chocolate chips and long, thin orange zest shavings, they were a hit!  I can't wait to try them with other flavors; thank you!"
303646,98783,5/9/2006,5,I wouldn't really describe the end product of this recipe as fudge but everyone who tried it couldn't get enough of it. My friend won't let me make anymore bcos she's addicted to these and i'm spoiling her diet; Lol! I hadn't got any pecans so i omitted them and added 1/2 teaspoon of chilli powder (sounds weird but it honestly tastes good). Thanks for this fabulous recipe!
213540,98783,9/29/2006,5,Awesome and soooooo easy! My 6 and 8 year old boys love to help make this and eat it too:) So far we like the peppermint extract the best. Four drops gave it a subtle peppermint flavor and 7 drops gave it a little more distinct flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!
198059,98783,10/22/2006,5,This is so delicious it's going to be my xmas gift of choice. 
361186,98783,10/27/2006,4,This was so quick and easy and the texture is perfect - so smooth. It cuts beautifully too. I just have to work on getting the flavor to how I like it. I think the idea of half milk-chocolate half semi-sweet is a good one. I tried peppermint instead of the orange flavor so that might have been part of the problem. The dark chocolate might have been a better compliment to the orange flavor.
751189,123665,4/2/2009,5,Love this!!
158087,98783,10/29/2006,5,It's amazing what a few ingredients can produce.  I used 2 c bittersweet and 1/2 c semi-sweet and skipped the pecans.  I will use this recipe from now on.  Thanks!
152393,98783,12/2/2006,4,"This is an easy, delicious recipe.  I had 3 cups of chocolate chips left so I  microwaved those with low-fat condensed milk at 30 second intervals until melted, then added 3 teaspoons of orange extract with the rest of the ingredients   After pouring into a pan, I grated a little extra orange peel on top.  This is a very good recipe for anyone that enjoys the taste of chocolate and orange together it makes a perfect addition to my holiday gift baskets!  Thanks Marg for this great recipe."
248414,98783,12/23/2006,5,This is a real star of a recipe! Incredibly easy and everyone loves it!  I also made it without the nuts and grated extra  orange zest on top.
473347,98783,4/30/2007,5,"This was my first try at making fudge and it couldn't have been easier. I used the microwave and added 2 teaspoons orange extract. I omitted the pecans, this is a keeper!"
106867,98783,5/18/2007,3,"This was good, but the texture is different than typical fudge.  This is absolutely smooth, without the grainyness I associate with fudge.  I left out the orange zest and just left it chocolate and nuts. Next time I will use a blend of milk and dark chocolate."
110433,98783,11/2/2007,5,"This is amazing! I brought half a batch in to work yesterday, and it was gone in minutes! I brought the other half today and it disappeared! My mother, who is very picky, loved it, and I'm making two batches for a friend's sweet trays for their wedding. I used orange flavour instead of zest. I'm going to try Cointreau in the next batch. Our cans are 12oz, so I used 2 cups and a handfull of chips and it worked beautifully. Melted in a glass measuring cup in the microwave. Thanks!

Update:  I just made a batch of these with zest, and the orange flavour really comes through.  I'm finding the two cups and a handfull too little though.  I'm going to bring it up to 2 1/2 cups of chips with our 10oz can so they don't get so soft if you leave them out for a bit.  Still taste amazing."
395940,98783,11/18/2007,3,"Creamy, but way too sweet. Easy one to make!"
360471,98783,11/25/2007,5,"I absolutely love how easy this is to make and it's really creamy and rich. I'm not crazy about orange and chocolate so I substituted about 3tsp of Peppermint extract (I say ""about"" because I was making a double batch and 6 tsp was almost the whole bottle of extract so I just dumped the rest in :) )Then I topped it with crushed peppermint pieces and OH MY GOSH!!! it was so good. I had to keep hubby and daughter off of it since I was making it as gifts..I let them have SOME, I'm not that mean. I was trying this out because I was wanting something that was easy but looked impressive and tatsed great to make for teachers and I definitely found it! This is going in my permanent file."
381180,98783,12/5/2007,5,Quick and easy ~ and delicious!  I made a 2-layer chocolate and peanut butter fudge ~ pairing this fudge (used 1 tsp vanila extract instead of the orange zest) with Recipe #115656.
506722,98783,12/8/2007,5,"Just made this plain for a first run.  Creamy, and yummy.  So easy.  Next time I'll add nuts, and will like it even better.  Thank you, I told Mom I'd do fudge for Dad because she just had surgery.  With a baby it was going to have to happen after he was in bed.  This was so easy, I made it while he played on the floor.  He saw the chocolate chips and started to scream (Mom gave him one last time we stopped by when I was doing laundry).  He likes fudge now, too.  Lucky for him I make it whenever Dad needs a fix, and at Christmas, but not weekly.  This was so easy it could be made weekly, but then I would really gain weight.:)"
231054,98783,12/10/2007,5,"What could possibly be easier -- and yet be so dang delicious???  I only add to what others have said -- what an easy fudge recipe -- and yes it DOES have feet because it truly can ""walk off the plate"".  I used the grated orange zest and added a couple drops of orange extract.  Peppermint is next!!!!  Thanks Marg for sharing this recipe with all of us."
209154,98783,12/13/2007,5,"A truly decadent fudge.  This fudge held its shape nicely and had a nice, smooth texture (not gritty).  LOVE the orange.  It made it taste similar to orange sticks.  Yummie!!!  I made three different fudges (#4075 & #68659) and this was my favoriate by far.  Thanks, Marg."
189616,98783,12/14/2007,5,"With how much my family enjoyed this fudge, I wish I actually had a sweet tooth. They raved over this. Was planning on orange, but everyone wanted me to make peppermint.
Super recipe!"
469903,98783,12/17/2007,5,"Perfect, easy orange fudge!!  I skipped the nuts and the fudge was smooth and creamy, just wonderful. I chilled in the fridge for about an hour and then easily cut into bite-size pieces and returned them to the fridge for safe keeping - they turned out beautifully. The only trouble will be keeping them around long enough to share for Christmas... can't keep anyone out of them! Really great recipe, I plan to make the peppermint too!"
451042,98783,12/21/2007,5,"This is the perfect, dark chocolately rich, dense fudge and orange combo. If you really want the orange to give a punch, I suggest adding 3 teaspoons of orange zest. Make sure your orange zest comes from an orange with thick, ripe skin.

I have been making this recipe for 3 years now and found that I have to melt the chocolate chips first and then add the milk. Otherwise it gets too thick and I cannot mix it.

My husband melted the chips and I added the milk and orange peel. 

We had to work quickly once the milk went in because it does thicken. We spread it in a baking dish lined with parchment paper and let it chill for 2 hours before cutting. I love the truffles idea and am going to attempt to do that with our next batch. Thanks!"
739521,98783,12/30/2009,5,Great Recipe!  Gave as gifts to several people who raved about it!  Can't believe how quick and easy this recipe was.  Thanks for posting!
226066,98783,12/22/2007,5,"36 people can't be wrong!!! :) Made this without the pecans and brought to the office for the last day of work before Christmas... these were gone within minutes!! (Glad I kept a few at home!! ;) - this is easy, sweet and oh so good!!  Thanks Marg for a fudge recipe that I will be making again and again!! :)"
537188,98783,12/25/2007,3,"Strangely enough, this fudge hasn't set. It does taste quite nice though but there's no way I would be able take it out of the tin - I think we're going to have to resort to eating it with spoons!"
548802,98783,12/27/2007,5,I really liked the simplicity of this recipe. I doubled it and made half peppermint (4teas peppermint extract) and half with pecans. I never added any orange flavoring. It adapted well. This was a big hit at Christmas!
479694,98783,1/2/2008,5,I used peppermint versus the orange.  It turned out very well especially me being the novice baker.  I could even  make it. I took it to a potluck and people raved. Next time I will use a little less peppermint then suggested in another review.  It came out a little strong
614212,98783,1/7/2008,5,"VERY easy, and turned out soooo well. It's delicious. DH loves it. I made it with mint this time, but I can't wait to try it with orange, that's what we really want....and then every other possible flavour :) this is the first time I've sucessfully made fudge, and I am so happy I tried this recipe. Oh, I left out the pecans as well."
242444,98783,1/8/2008,5,"So easy and yummy.  The first time I made it I used 1 bag of chocolate chips.  It was good, but not as good as when I made it again and used the full 2 1/2 cups. I also omitted the nuts.  

I have also melted the chocolate and condensed milk together then split the batch in half and made half peppermint and half orange.  It's good both ways."
354628,98783,2/3/2008,5,"This is great. This is actually the one thing my brother in law requested I make as soon as he returned from Iraq.
I also top it with an orange glaze.  I mix powdered sugar, and milk, with food coloring and orange extract. It makes it colorful, and adds a little something extra."
544026,98783,2/19/2008,4,"I made this for a chocolate party at work and both DH and I liked them (I made both the orange and the peppermint variety). I used zest from freshly picked oranges, yet we barely could detect the orange flavor. I used a 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract, and also had difficulty in identifying the flavor....so I added another 1/2 tsp. It seemed to work better. With the orange zest, I added chopped pecans, and nothing to the peppermint variety. We both liked the orange flavor better, albeit faint. It may be the nuts that drew us to that decision. All in all, it was a very good recipe, but not out of this world. This is an easy recipe to follow and to make. Thanks for posting, Marg."
13483,98783,4/27/2008,5,Just a very easy yet excellent fudge to make.  I used the pepermint extract  (about a teaspoon) and it was great.  Love easy and good stuff like this.  Thanks for the post.
774187,98783,6/28/2008,5,"WONDERFUL fudge! What a wonderful marriage of flavors! I did add an extra teaspoon of freshly grated zest, left out the nuts and used milk chocolate chips rather than the semi sweet. Made it for a dinner party, and it was a HUGE hit! I would recommend refrigerating over night or at least eight hours. I did mine for four and they were still slightly gooey. But still scrumptious! And the flavor of the orage did seem to come out more the next day. I don't know why. But Yummy!"
97780,98783,12/14/2008,3,This gets credit for being easy but just didn't do much for me.  Maybe using milk chocolate chips would have made it better.  I hoped the sweet milk would sweeten up the chocolate but it really didn't and then the orange seemed to make the judge bitter.  I love orange chocolate but I won't be making this again.
944660,98783,12/16/2008,1,"WORST fudge recipe I have ever had the misfortune of making! It gets one star from me because it apparently worked for other people. This garbage did not set properly, even after over 15 hours. Do NOT make this recipe unless you are willing to risk the colossal waste of time and money."
1055399,98783,12/23/2008,5,"I LOVE this fudge recipe!! It is very versatile. I made it once with only the choc. chips, condensed milk and 1/2 tsp of orange extract, once with the choc. chips, cond. milk, and 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract and crushed candycane on top, and once with choc. chips, cond. milk, and walnuts. I used Nestle choc. chips and Borden Sweetened Condensed Milk and it set perfectly. It was solid, yet creamy. What an easy, yet delicious recipe!!!!"
297303,98783,2/23/2009,3,"although, this candy had a great orange flavor, we didn't care for this.  It's not what I consider fudge. My husband thought it was more on the chewy side.  I also don't care to keep my fudges refrigerated.  When I took it out of the refrigerator, the chocolate melted on our fingers.  Sorry, I was really hoping to love this, seeing how it is so easy."
384088,98783,3/30/2009,5,I made this for the holidays and it was a big hit! This has now been added to my regular baking goodies. :-)
274467,98783,12/18/2009,5,"Fantastic!  Super easy, too.  I used 2 tsp. orange extract instead of the orange zest, and it was perfect.  I made one batch without nuts and used chopped walnuts for the other, since it was what I had on hand.  Today, I am going to try and make a mint variation.  Thanks for the recipe, Marg!"
228229,98783,12/19/2009,5,"Very, very, very good!"
592157,81341,8/19/2008,5,This was really very good.  I did cut back on the chilies (family preference) but it still had so much flavor.
87236,98783,1/3/2010,5,"Incredible!!!  So many people raved about this fudge (which I have made twice in a week already!) and I felt a twinge of guilt about the fact that it only took about five minutes to prepare, from start to finish!!!  I have made fudge in the past which entailed a lot of time and fuss, and all I can say is that nothing compared to the ease, simplicity and taste of this recipe! Instead of using orange zest, I used 1 1/2 tsp of orange extract, and it tasted just like Chocolate Orange confectionery that can be bought in the candy section of grocery stores! (but softer)!  I placed the condensed milk and Chocolate chips in a bowl, mixed it together, then nuked it in the microwave at power level 7 for three minutes. After mixing it with a wooden spoon until it was smooth and blended, I added the extract. So easy!  This recipe will readily lend itself to experimentation. (and I WILL be experimenting!)  Maybe next time I'll use white chocolate chips with almond extract, or maybe peanut butter chips! Thank you so much for posting, Marg!"

688566,98783,6/3/2010,5,"Fantastic, whipped this up this morning before work.  Made in microwave as per another reviewers suggestion 3 minutes on 70% power.  Didn't even stir during this time.  Mixed together beautifully.  I used about a cup each of milk and dark chocolate and half a cup on peppermint chocolate & about 1/2 tsp peppermint essence.  Its in the fridge chilling now & the whole process took only 5 minutes.  From the taste on the spoon this is going to be great.  Is supposed to be a gift for this afternoon, hope it makes it there!"
307475,98783,12/1/2010,0,"These are great for someone like me who can't have gluten! I used the peppermint extract, and they flew off the plate at a party I hosted.<br/><br/>My only thought, and this sounds a little silly perhaps: be sure you are using sweetened condensed milk and not evaporated milk, as the latter would yield terrible, wet results."
1144471,98783,12/18/2010,4,"I made this just as directed and I LOVED the flavor. Not sure I am 100% fan of the consistancy...I like my fudge a little more firm. But, have decided to make another batch and cook it a little longer to see if that makes a difference."
344199,98783,12/19/2010,5,This fudge tastes like a Cadbury Chocolate orange!  I added a tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp orange extract and 2 Tablespoons of butter.  Delicious!
938397,98783,12/5/2011,4,I really enjoyed this fudge.  Simple. Easy.  Quick.  I used dark chocolate and walnuts. I rate 4 stars as a recipe that I would do again and share with others.  5 stars is something I'm dying to make again and add to my home cookbook.  The only reason I didn't do 5 stars is becuase I like the texture of Mackinaw Island fudge the most (which the make on cooled granite stone).  Thanks for sharing!
875884,98783,12/16/2011,5,"wow, so good and so easy!  I found that letting the fudge set in the refrigerator overnight made a big difference in the texture, even after it was brought back to room temp.  I used dried cranberries in place of the nuts - orange cranberry fudge!!!  Thanks for a really nice recipe."
83698,98783,12/23/2011,5,"This actually came out much better than I anticipated.  I made it with orange extract and walnuts.  I usually spend a ton of time each December baking like mad for my staff, but this year I didn't have time, so I sought out easy recipes.  This was SO quick in the microwave.  After the first batch, I decided I wanted mocha, too, so I made a batch and left out the orange extract.  I added an individual packet of instant coffee to the milk before heating, and it came out perfect.  Thanks for the simple recipe I can use year after year."
222564,98783,12/7/2012,5,Just fantastic!
1256030,98783,9/14/2013,0,Really really nice. The only thing is that it didn&#039;t settle enough for me to cut pieces. That is probaby because I used a little more milk (400g can).
1800333792,98783,11/28/2013,5,"Cadbury Orange Chocolate hello! This recipe is so easy a child could make it and it would turn out. It disappeared as fast as it was made. I used orange extract, 2 tsp., what flavor. I used my microwave for 2 min., mixed it up well with the extract, put it in the pan and let cool, then covered with foil and put it into the frig. 2 hrs. later it was set and ready. My son, husband, daughter-in- law and 3 teenage boys devoured all of it. Thank you very much."
1197624,98783,12/31/2013,0,Came out perfect.  Did not need to keep chilled after it had set.  I probably added a bit more zest than listed.
145352,175042,10/2/2011,5,Great! Exactly what I had in mind!
140132,98783,12/22/2014,5,this is so creamy it practically melts in your mouth.  We loved the hint of orange in this too.  Great addition to our holiday trays. Thank you.
1803605182,98783,1/3/2015,5,"Fantastic recipe!  Very easy to follow, even for a rubbish cook like me, and the result was amazing!  I can&#039;t wait to use this recipe again and experiment with flavours!  Can&#039;t recommend it highly enough."
2000789283,98783,12/31/2015,5,"Yes!
I made this tasty fudge last night. I love chocolate + orange, so I followed the recipe exactly...including the zest.
I couldn&#039;t believe how fast and easy it was. The texture was smooth, and the fudge was creamy, with a nicely balanced orange flavor. The toasted nuts added crunchy texture. What a win!"
2001334978,98783,1/3/2017,5,This looks lovely - I can't wait to try it!
985030,113577,10/11/2008,3,"One thing... It might be best not to use wheat flour, as it can be an allergen in dogs. Apart from that it sounds great! Thanks!"
118163,138734,9/25/2005,5,"Wow, these were great! I am a hude mushroom fan, and probably a bigger avocado fan so these little guys were jut perfect to me. The thing I added was a little sour cream on the tops of them because I love the combination of hot and cold things. These toasts were creamy, crunchy, juicy, and down right good! They also pair nicely with a glass of merlot. lol. Thanx for posting!"
197023,138734,10/29/2005,5,"Chef Kate, these were just SO delicious!  Served these today as a light – but totally sustaining and satisfying – lunch, and I totally recommend this recipe to all who love mushrooms and avocado: a great weekend brunch/lunch dish, or mid-week supper dish.  Quick to prepare, and really scrumptious!  Thank you for sharing!"
58104,138734,11/4/2005,5,I cut back on the oil using 1 tablespoon in total for sauting the mushrooms and onions. Didn`t need to top the toasts with any. I found this will serve more then four you can top a whole loaf with the mixture. I enjoy mushrooms and avocados and never thought to put them together. These are great! I used thyme in place of the tarragon. very good and even better knowing I cut more then 1/2 the oil out!
47892,138734,11/9/2005,5,"You stole my plans to post this recipe here, Mizz Kate! This is so gooooood!! I love the avocado with all the other ingredients!"
296809,138734,7/6/2006,5,"Boy did we ever love this! Except for your bread suggestion, I made this exactly as written. We had it as part of a ZWT appy nite when we tried several things. After adding the avocado & warming it, I stuffed the mix into pita pockets & “dressed” them as directed w/the finishing touches. Was so good that I’ve made it already a 2nd time & will share w/our fishing friends this weekend. Thx for posting."
314579,138734,9/19/2006,4,"Kate, this was yummy!  I used small flour tortillas heated under the broiler instead of bread.  I also was out of parmesean, so I used Montrachet goat cheese. Will make this again. (PS. using the new Zaar rating system)"
220582,138734,9/30/2006,5,"delish! we modified it a bit for our diet, but used the same basic ingredients. we opted for crisped tortillas, and i cooked everything in a wok to avoid any oil. i didn't have any cheese or herbs, so i just used onion, mushrooms and avacado and drizzled with balsamic. just wonderful."
125388,138734,12/28/2006,5,"Very good flavor!  I used 1/2 pound mushrooms and a whole small avocado.  I did not add olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the top, because it didn't seem to need it.  This makes enough for 16-20 baguette slices, not 4."
355920,138734,1/21/2007,3,"Very nice, quick, easy meal to prepare. I'm not a 100% sure I would add the tarragon next time. This recipe, as posted, definitely makes more than 4 servings, it's more like 8 rather than 4. All in all, a good meal."
105352,138734,2/20/2007,5,This was excellent and itt had lots of flavor. I didn't have any tarragon and substituted basil which worked well. Also I added the olive oil and balsamic vinegar to pan and mixed slightly. Great recipe!
527607,138734,2/20/2008,5,"delicious, easy and wonderful.  Great to have with a drink or as a light lunch."
303700,184092,9/22/2007,5,"Reviewed for PAC Fall 2007
I LOVE this recipe...I think what really makes it for me is allowing the cukes,onion and potato to marinate in the vinaigrette.
Thanks Adessa!"
28177,184092,5/15/2008,5,"Oh what a surprise!  Putting two of my favorite salads together... brilliant!  I love marinated cucumbers (mom did it all the time growing up) & I love creamy potato salad.  This combination of the two is really refreshing.  It was so simple to throw together too.  DH & DS(15) both said it was the addition of cucumber that really made this salad pop.  DD(2) is eating it again for breakfast... hey, when you got a picky toddler you gotta feed them whatever they'll eat!  We will be making this one again.  Thanks for sharing Adessa!  Adopted from the PAC Spring 2008 orphanage."
56003,184092,7/29/2008,5,"This was scrumptious!  What a lovely marriage of flavors.  I can't pick out any one thing that is special, because everything is great just the way it is.  Thnx for posting, Adessa."
226863,184092,4/15/2010,5,"Lovely tasting potato salad!  Loved the taste of the marinade, and the bonus of the creamy taste.  It was a little ""runny"", but I probably didn't drain mine well enough!  Made for PAC Spring 2010."
124249,191159,4/16/2007,5,"Served these at my Easter Tea party. I cut the bread into bunny shapes. Everyone liked them. Thanks Redneck Epicurean for a easy and tasty tea sandwich.

Bullwinkle."
59780,191159,4/24/2007,5,We served this as part of my Daughter's 10th birthday party formal tea party. These were a big hit with the kids. I dipped the banana slices into gingerale and then assembled the sandwiches and the gingerale prevented the bananas from getting brown. Thanks for sharing!
79997,191159,7/24/2007,5,Your legacy lives on in this delightfully simple recipe packed with flavor.  I like the idea of cutting them into shapes.  This is in my keeper box.
592157,191159,8/12/2009,5,Simple and delicious. My little one loved them.
573325,191159,2/15/2012,5,"Oh yum, what a great combination of flavours! The banana goes great with the honey and bread making this a truly delightful sandwich. I used a local creamy organic honey and organic bananas with local pumpernickel bread for a wholesome treat. Just great and also very pretty to look at! I didnt measure the honey, just spread it on there. :)<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing a keeper with us, Redneck Epicurean!<br/>Made and reviewed for the Honey Tag Game in the Spain/Portugal Forum February 2012."
264017,222146,2/24/2008,3,"This was just OK for us. Even with all the listed spices, it seemed to be missing something in the flavor. There was also at least 2 extra cups of sauce that I'll find a use for. Tagged, made and reviewed for the Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup Game."
369715,324179,9/25/2008,3,This was good but a bit thick for us. I have a similar recipe but we use more milk. It has a good taste and a little bit goes a long way. I made the recipe as written.
383346,448190,2/20/2011,5,Very yummy and great texture.  Thanks LadyRatri :)  Made for New Kids on the Block tag game
2000431022,467556,8/26/2015,0,Loved this for breakfast. My husband had to ask for seconds. I added salt for taste. Thanks for sharing
2002158749,469599,5/20/2018,4,It went great but one or 2 cracked other than that it went well
2000539634,512986,10/9/2015,1,"The standing ovation was for an ice cream I made while working at square one. This is not my original recipe, however. I always called it tootsie roll ice cream. I don&#039;t know why Joyce refers to this as hers.  The only difference in her recipe and mine was that I used half cream and half whole milk and bittersweet chocolate not semi-sweet. The standing ovation was not for this recipe."
265954,523223,10/9/2015,3,"This is a good starter recipe. I made as directed and thought it was missing something, maybe some diced onion and celery for crunch. With the barbecue sauce, this dish did not need the additional brown sugar, which made this a little too sweet for us. On the plus side, this is a quick and easy recipe to throw together when pressed for time."
2000462154,523223,9/12/2016,5,Quick and easy recipe. Absolutely love it.
39835,81341,1/27/2004,5,Chia this deserves more than 5 stars -- rave reviews all around.  Even my non-fish eaters raved about this fish. We had the salmon with a green salad and baked potatoes for a perfect weekday meal. I did subsitute 2 Ancho chilies with a spoonful of adobo sauce for the chipotle chilies (which I forgot to buy)and forgot the sugar but I don't think that made that much of a difference. Thanks for sharing! We will be having this often.
37080,89619,6/1/2004,5,"In the words of my DH - GOOD STUFF. He loved it and I couldn't keep him away from the plate when it was cooling. Don't have a toaster oven so I broiled the sandwiches in the oven.  This is going to be had again and again for an easy, quick summer dinner - thanks!!!"
101275,89619,6/10/2004,5,"Great sandwiches Chari! Took them for my birthday celebration picnic and we really enjoyed them. I did not toast these as carrying them would make the bread soft anyway. Omitted the chilli because I spread some green coriander-chilli chutney on the bread slices to keep them moist. DH, DS, DMIL, DFIL and Dme;) enjoyed them immensely! Thank you! BTW instead of cake I cut your sandwiches :) Fay   "
727442,89619,1/14/2008,5,I love this recipe .. so good.  I used the filling inside pastry sheets to make patties as an appetizer.  They were a hit.  I think I used a regular onion instead of spring onions.
166475,119052,12/9/2005,4,"I'm editing my original review because the first time I made these I used all splenda, and THAT was the reason the cookies were dry and crumbly.  However, the second time I made them I DID add another 1/4 cup butter to the recipe, and they came out perfectly, so I would suggest 3/4 cup total butter instead of the 1/2 cup stated. Also, I used a combination of white and brown sugar instead of all white - personal preference, love the taste the brown sugar brings to the table."
682182,119052,2/11/2008,5,"Wow!  These are amazing!  I have always had trouble with cookies, but these came out perfect first time!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, family and friends will be enjoying this many times in the future! :)"
931627,119052,12/20/2010,4,"It is EXTREMELY hard to get all of the ingredients into a quart jar. My suggestion is to pack the M & M's in a cute little bag and then attach them. I agree with the other reviewer, this recipe tastes very good but needs an extra 1/4 c of butter or an extra egg (this is what I did...turned out great!) or else it is a bit too dry."
152946,124417,6/18/2007,2,The topping was pretty good but the actual cake was SO DRY!
88099,141380,5/17/2007,4,"We had this last night and enjoyed it.  I decreased the kosher salt to 1 tsp and that seemed to be plenty, and increased the rosemary to 2 tsp.  Grilled these outside and they turned out very moist and tender.  I marinaded them for about 12 hours.  Very nice.  thanks"
900992,141380,4/13/2011,2,We thought this was *extremely* salty and didn't care for it.
560491,168347,3/13/2013,5,I am not a huge fan of the traditional green bean casserole so to find a new version that is soooo much better is great!  Made with a 16 oz pack if haricot verts that I steamed for 7 minutes rather than boiling.  I also used white cheddar cheese since that is all I had left.  This casserole was very flavorful and paired well with our grilled BBQ chicken.  Made for Photoless Recipe Tag.
89831,175042,7/4/2006,5,"This is a wonderful rice recipe! I doubled the ingredients, chopped the onion and increased the garlic to 2 heaping tablespoonfuls, I also added in some toasted almonds and lots of freshly ground black pepper, thanks for sharing this recipe akgrown, we loved it!...Kitten:)"
176615,175042,7/15/2006,5,"Great quick side dish with lots of flavor! Really kicks up the flavor of brown rice. I served this with baked chicken and a salad for a simple but wonderful meal. Used a Vidalia onion and because I really let it carmelize in the saute pan, probably could have done without the brown sugar. Would suggest using a bit of the broth to deglaze the saute pan so that all of the yummy bits aren't lost, and of course, homemade chicken stock. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!"
334558,175042,7/18/2006,5,It was a wonderful rice recipe!! I did add an extra clove of garlic! We had this with baked mushroom chicken and a light salad. From now on Im making my rice like this!!!!
141293,175042,7/23/2006,5,This was delicious!  Loved the combination of sweet caramelized onion and nutty brown rice.  Will definately make again and again.
322548,175042,10/10/2006,5,"Wow! I loved this I made one batch and then another...
usually I'm a brown rice lover but I used white basmati in this to use some up and it was wonderful but brown rice works better. The only other change I made was veg stock for the chicken cause I don't like the dead things. This went really well with mommymakes's spinach balls heaven! "
230331,175042,10/21/2006,5,I have never been a big fan of brown rice but this recipe changed my mind.  My husband thought it was okay and he would eat it again.  This is a big step because if it's not rice-a-roni it's not good.  I did use brown basmati rice because I had that to use up and I did it on the stove b/c I have no rice cooker.  Wonderful!
189616,175042,7/30/2007,3,"I rarely make brown rice, but the recipe sounded delicious. I'm sure this recipe is fantastic if you like brown rice, so this review is based on our personal taste. I found it okay-too sweet and nutty. My DH no comment-just o.k., my youngest normally a rice lover-it's alright, kind of chewy though my eldest DS-it tastes like crayons (?)he is 13 yrs. old. If I used white rice I'm sure everyone would like it more. I cooked this in the microwave since I don't have a rice cooker.
I served this with recipe#77758 and recipe#67615"
191533,175042,8/13/2009,5,"I thought this was a delicious way to make brown rice a little special. I halved the recipe for two of us, but used 1 1/2 cups broth. I omitted the sugar; I think caramelized onions have their own sweetness."
1802198,175042,1/21/2011,5,My fiance and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!! We first tried it a little less than a month ago and have made it 3 or 4 times. It is the best rice recipe ever.
2590005,175042,7/7/2013,5,"Found this recipe on one of those websites where you search for recipes based on the ingredients you already have in your fridge. I just wanted something cheap and easy to make, but this was so, so, so much better than I thought it was going to be, and super cheap. (Like I said, I just made this with things I needed to clean out of my fridge.) If you have a rice cooker, you really need to make this like now. I didn&#039;t use butter, and the chicken broth could easily be substituted with veggie broth, so I think it can be both vegan and gluten free. This would make a fantastic side dish but my boyfriend ate this as a light dinner and were fine, although we did add a little bit of chicken and some mushrooms that needed cooking. Honestly, though, this really doesn&#039;t need anything else, although I think this recipe would do well with some experimentation. Maybe we&#039;ll serve with some broccoli or asparagus on the side next time. Like a previous reviewer, I really caramelized my onions, and they were sweet and brown and flavorful, but I still think that the brown sugar really sent this over the top. Omit the added sugar if it&#039;s really that important to you. Just make sure that you do caramelize your onions--the extra time and effort makes a world of difference. &lt;br/&gt;Seriously. Make. This."
539977,190436,12/3/2010,4,"Super yummy!  The sage with the pork was perfect!!  This didn't really need the beans or cranberries, and it cooked dry.  I added water to save the beans. Very salty. Very tasty though. The pork was a huge hit, and those of us who like beans, used the gravy.  LOVED the fresh sage, mine was cut from garden, washed and used. super good herbs"
1383525,190436,2/25/2013,5,"This is a great recipe! I have made it twice and the second time, I did it in the crock pot. It turned out perfect both times."
860079,204064,1/2/2010,4,"Very nice cocoa ~ I used coconut milk instead of regular and Splenda instead of sugar ~ the cinnamon and vanilla are very nice additions to this. Thanks for posting, made for Comfort Cafe Snow Queens Round, January 2010!"
37449,204064,1/21/2010,5,I used almond milk and loved the cinnamon and vanilla! Thanks! Made for the Comfort Cafe-Jan. 2010.
865936,204064,12/20/2011,5,"Funny how all the reviewers have changed this recipe, huh?  I made this as directed except substituted Splenda for the sugar.  Came out great!  Not too chocolatey; not too sweet.  I topped it with a squirt of canned whipped cream and a squirt of chocolate-vodka whipped topping too."
169430,204064,4/28/2012,5,"Ok, here's the rundown, lol. Used Splenda for the sugar, *dark* cocoa, fat free coffee creamer for most of the milk (for rich taste and body). Loved the touch of salt, it really added some depth. This was truly well enjoyed. :D"
89549,342853,12/15/2008,5,"This is a easy and tasty recipe.  I used some Italian sausage I had in the freezer, but I believe it will be better with regular breakfast sausage... just my taste. 
I also used apricot preserves since I had no apple jelly.
I will make this again."
929600,342853,12/30/2008,5,"These were fantastic! I made them as the appetizer for Christmas dinner with friends. So quick and easy.  I used 3 lbs. of turkey sausage. 1 lb. regular, 1 lb. sweet, and 1 lb. hot.  Perfect. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
1164201,356391,3/9/2009,5,"I substituted BOCA meatless Italian Sausages to cut down significantly on fat content, and it turned out fantastic. I even got enough leftovers for a few days worth of work lunches.
Great, great recipe and now one of my favorites."
1055797,356391,7/21/2009,0,"At our Olive Garden this recipe is no longer on the menu,  but they will make it for you if you ask."
2000186415,356391,5/5/2015,5,Try using a can of chopped tomatoes with italian seasonings De Freitellies (spelling?) instead of tomoto sauce. I think its better and closer to what you get at Olive garden.
724516,407499,5/11/2011,5,"This is a very nice recipe, I didn't add any liquid i.e. stock, mine held well together if it had been dry I would of added it but it was fine I also went for the more seasonings as I think the more flavour the better. I did add a tablespoon of flax meal rather than breadcrumbs and baked it in the oven for 1hour. I would definitely make this again it's very healthy and very tasty. Thank you for posting. Made for Honor thy Mother the diabetic forum May 2011"
239758,428522,6/18/2010,4,"Delicious dip and so easy to make. I have industrial-size jars of artichoke hearts and pimento, so I guessed a bit on quantities. I used about 10 ounces of artichokes and 1 1/'2 ounces of pimento -- figuring that drained weight is about 60-70 per cent of the actual posted weight. I still thought something was lacking so added about 1/4 cup of flat-leaf parsley and a very generous hit of salt. Sorry that I missed getting a photo. I finished making it just before I was dashing out the door to take it to an event. Then I let someone else take home the leftovers. I hope to make it again soon and post a photo. Thanks for posting."
225853,428522,7/2/2010,5,"We very much enjoyed this dip.  We ate it on sourdough bread, on Scottish oat cakes and with chips.  All good.  Thanks for posting this yummy recipe.  ZWT6

29196,428522,1/13/2011,5,"I made this 24 hours ahead to allow the flavours to come together. We and our guests loved this and couldn't stop eating it. I made no changes to your recipe, but we all agreed the dip tasted better as it softened and came to room temperature. I WILL be making this reasonable low fat treat again and again and am so glad I found it!"
482376,428522,2/5/2012,5,"Delicious appetizer. I love artichokes and feta so I was pretty sure this recipe would be a winner. I love the consistency; perfect for spreading on crackers or for dipping veggies. The flavor is perfect; just enough oregano, garlic and lemon juice. I omitted the pimento. Thanks for a winner!"
383346,431870,7/15/2010,5,"This is so yummy.  A great grilled cheese.  I used shard cheddar cheese, so good with the fresh tomatoes and basil.  A swiss cheese would be great also.  Thanks Ellie :)  Made for Newest Zaar tag"

37449,471446,3/19/2013,5,I scaled the recipe back for one and used the thin whole wheat buns. It was a little messy but oh so good. Thanks! Made for Rookie tag game.
285039,471446,5/19/2013,5,Perfect &quot;burger&quot; to make for both vegetarians and meat eaters ..... just place the mushroom stack on top of a grilled burger or serve as written.  Loved the flavors!
169430,471446,11/6/2013,5,Perfection in a bun. I used a bun made with Recipe #462165 recipe. This is so very good as written I think it could become a classic.
124577,40275,2/13/2004,5,"I am not a lover of venison,but my daughter gave me some to do up.
I found this marinade,and let me say it was terrific,a little sweet but was very good & very easy to do,enough for 3 venison steaks. .  thank You  Frances Hoover"
242729,40275,6/29/2008,5,"I did not know what Wesson Oil was, so I used sunflower oil in its place! I also used Maple Syrup in place of the sugar, as I bought a big jar just for the ZWT tour of Canada!! I minced my onions VERY finely in my food processor. I had no bell peppers handy unfortunately....I am sure that the marinade would be great with them added next time. Thanks DG for the basis of a great and yet such an easy marinade - used on venison steaks today! FT:-)"
687302,40275,9/16/2010,5,I made this a few weeks ago & I have to tell you that it converted a few people that would normally refuse to eat venison. Thanks for a keeper!
136997,107564,11/4/2005,5,These little gems are so good. I really like the orange flavor and I managed to get 24 nice size cookies out of the batch. :)
206747,107564,2/27/2007,5,"I have made these the past 2 holidays for my gift cookie plates.  I use the orange liquer rather than juice.  They are easily put together, and make a nice contrast to all the chocolate and brown cookies, especially with the edge of dipped icing. The orange flavor also makes a nice ""bite"", which is a little different. Thanks for posting, Sharlene."
1179225,107564,11/30/2011,5,I have been making these during the holidays for years. I've had the recipe saved in a binder and its stained from use. I love the contrast in texture and flavor. I use craisins for a little more tang. Thanks for posting this great recipe!
375077,145178,11/23/2008,5,"Yummy, but left off strawberries.
Thanks for great brunch idea!"
498271,168562,10/12/2012,4,Great broccoli!  Loved all that garlic and the saltiness of the cheese.  I had some shredded parmesan/asiago blend on hand so that's what I used.  Easy and tasty - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for Fall PAC 2012
2000262334,200083,6/11/2015,4,"This cookie is great! Me and the whole family loved than. Highly recommended! But next time if I made them again, I would use 1/4 less oats."
324390,174219,11/12/2006,5,This tastes like a tropical smoothie!You really taste the coconut! I used frozen strawberries and banana slices which helped to make it extra thick! I'll be making this one again!
422893,174219,6/24/2007,4,"This was really yummy, I made a half batch for DD & I to share, great blend of flavours, I did find that the coconut flavour didn't shine through as I would have liked (I did use a home made low fat blend though so possibly not as flavourful as a canned one), will increase that by a little next time, just a personal preference. Made for ZWT III."
382071,174219,6/15/2008,4,YUMMY CREAMY FRUITY DELICIOUS! I made this with orange juice and added fresh pineapple chunks. I also used extra ice and added Splenda. Freddy Cat says thanks for the drink! Made for the ZWT4.
590105,174219,6/23/2008,5,"Very tasty!  Because I was using frozen strawberries, I didn't use any ice.  A great drink.  Might try orange juice next time, as I ususally have that on hand.  Thanks!  Reviewed for ZWT4."
424680,174219,7/4/2008,5,"When I made this WONDERFUL TASTING DRINK, I left out the ice but used freshly frozen strawberries! Loved the addition of coconut milk ~ VERY NICE! [Made & reviewed in the Family Picks part of Zaar World Tour 4]"
168896,200083,8/1/2007,5,five star cookie recipe. but be warned; these are the type of cookie you cannot stop eating; the texture and taste are great.  i did have to make a few changes; first i changed it to make 21 cookies and the recipe worked out fine.  (i didnt want to have lots of cookies lying around in case they turned out great; good thing i thought ahead!) and i didnt have any fresh brown sugar so had to use sugar in the raw.  i opted to leave out the additional white sugar and i used organic bulk oats so i dont know if they were quick cooking or not.  they were very easy to put together and the taste was super even without the white sugar.  i found them definitly sweet enough.  the texture was nice; chewy and soft but the texture of the oats was detectable which made it have some substance.  i used a chopped up organic dark chocolate candy bar instead of the chips per my daughters request.  they were excellent and will make them again.  thanks for sharing.
155886,200083,8/8/2007,2,"Sorry, these were very crumbly.  Perhaps more flour or oats would help produce a more formed cookie."
253462,200083,8/12/2007,5,"By far the best oatmeal cookie I've ever eaten.  I didn't find them to be crumbly at all.  
I tend to ""tweak"" recipe's to my liking, so this is what I did - used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup crisco, omitted the nuts and used very little choc chips.  Was fantastic!  My family and neighbors all loved them."
561296,200083,8/14/2007,5,My kids LOVE this recipe!  Great for little hands to help out with :)
262671,200083,12/10/2007,5,"Yum Yum Yummy!!! Great cookie for giving away at Christmas time.  I'm packing little gift boxes tonight!!! By the way i used regular oatmeal, and it was delicious, oatmeal kept its texture."
1255784,200083,5/1/2009,5,"This recipe is FABULOUS!  Almost every cookie recipe I try turns out horrible, but this one was so easy and turned out just the way it says!  Look forward to making this again soon!"
1306875,200083,6/28/2009,5,These were awesome! Definitely recommend them! I left out the cinnamon!
236261,200083,9/4/2009,0,Awesome cookies...they were just what I was looking for!  I doubled the batch and used 1/2 butter & 1/2 shortening and they turned out perfect!
1307773,200083,11/3/2009,4,"good cookie, thnx"
196341,200083,12/25/2009,5,"This is a great cookie! Thanks, Darshirl, for posting this recipe!"
311660,200083,2/27/2010,5,These were great!  Stayed soft the next morning and tasted just great.  Thanks for this recipe.
1628888,200083,6/6/2010,5,love this recipe!
747588,200083,10/10/2010,5,These cookies were excellent!! I added raisins instead of walnuts. My husband ate 'em up.....thanks so much for posting. I'll definitely make these again! :)
160977,200083,1/28/2011,3,"Like another reviewer I also added raisins instead of walnuts. The cookies were easy to make and I got 40 cookies, they baked for 15 minutes. Both the chocolate chips and the raisins sort of disappeared, no taste of either in the finished cookie which was very crumbly and stayed that way. <br/>We liked them but I have had better, therefore three stars.<br/>Thanks for posting."
204024,200083,9/20/2012,5,"I got fifty chewy, sweet oatmeal cookies and the baking time and temperature were spot on, which has been unusual in my experience. I used chocolate chips and chopped walnuts, and might add raisins for variety in a future batch. Delicious and, for me, a bit nostalgic; we made cookies like this in my small-town childhood. Thanks!"
2950705,200083,5/24/2014,5,"Made these tonight and they were fantastic.  Crispy outside, chewy inside.  Will make these regularly."
2000584807,200083,10/20/2015,5,"I made these as &#039;healthy&#039; as possible, omitting all refined sugar &amp; flour. I subbed sucanat for the brown sugar (didn&#039;t bother to use/sub the white sugar), oat flour for the all purpose and 63% cocoa chocolate bar chopped instead of the chips. They were great and worked very well with the substitutions for those wanting a healthier alternative."
2000893816,200083,2/27/2016,5,"My family loves these cookies! I have made this recipe several times now, and the cookies turn out great every time. I always split the batter and make half oatmeal raisen, half chocolate chip. Both are delicious!"
73951,200083,3/31/2017,5,A perfect cookie recipe I will make again and again! Onlychange was subbing in 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Thank you for sharing!
2001496630,200083,4/19/2017,5,THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST DELICIOUS COOKIE I HAVE EVER HAD! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect... so chewy... sweet.. perfect hint of cinnamon.
2001469482,200083,11/11/2017,5,best recipe I have tried so far
2001610686,200083,1/3/2018,5,A perfect cookie
2001911082,200083,1/4/2018,0,"Very good cookie as written, also made a batch with white chocolate chips. Really tasty as well."
1861735,200083,2/8/2018,5,My roommate wanted oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. Anything I've made from this site has been AMAZING!! Both he and his Dad loved these cookies. I did add just 2 1/2 cups of oats. 13 minutes is spot on for the bake time! Thanks so much for a simple tasty cookie recipe. I'll definitely be making these again!
2002016058,200083,2/26/2018,0,Best chocolate chip cookie I have ever made!
2002055576,200083,3/16/2018,5,Absolutely awesome! I never use quick cooking oats so I just poured milk over my steelcut oats enough to slightly moisten and let them sit 15 min before using. Also omitted walnuts for family preferences and used all demerara brown sugar. Proportions were still right. I was also out of baking soda and used nearly 1 tbsp baking powder. This will be my go-to chocolate chip cookie forever. Thanks for the recipe!!
2000741256,200083,5/11/2018,5,"My sister made these and said they were awesome so I decided to try them too. BEST. DECISION. EVER. These were gobbled down by my kids and I within 10 mins of taking them out. I halved the recipe and got 20 cookies. I also subbed the chocolate chips for raisins and half the plain flour with whole wheat flour. I have a fan forced oven so I lowered the temp to 50&deg;c and baked for 14 minutes. My sister told me they wouldn't look done when you take them out but when they cool, they'll harden. This is going to be a favorite recipe around here!!"
49304,55649,3/22/2003,5,"Bev, this is so delicious, I served it on mixed greens with sliced mango and pear. Loved the flavor of the port and balsamic vinegar with the spices. The recipe is a keeper, even though my DH didn't care as much for it."
1802989504,200083,8/15/2018,5,"BEST oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe ever. I have made these 5 or 6 times in the last 5 months! I use mini chocolate chips. Sometimes I grind 7 grains and replaced some of the flour. Other times I just used all 7 grains whole. Tonight I mixed rolled oats 7 grains and quick oats. I like to let the dough rest in the fridge overnight, so we'll see how this batch turns out tomorrow. They always get a great reaction as best cookie ever! Crunchy, chewy and soft in the middle all at the same time! This is the cookie my family, friends, and co-workers ask for!"
2002285688,200083,9/27/2018,4,"These turn down out delicious ! Perfectly crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle . I halved the recipe and also got about 20 cookies . My only tweak would be chilling the dough for about an hour , I find it prevents the cookies from spreading excessively . Will definitely be making these again ????"
679953,217774,2/3/2009,5,"Wow !! Was this really good !  So easy, and quick.  Its amazing that we saved some for the DS.  This would be great for unexpected company.  I used creamy peanut butter.  Flavoring, prep time, and the results get an A+ here.  Made for Holiday tag."
446523,258050,3/25/2008,5,"very yummy.  I used a fresh chilli as i couldn't find canned here in oz.  wow it had a good kick in it lovely for lunch.
thanks 
Made for Edition 4: MAKE MY RECIPEâ€”a game of tag!"
464080,258050,4/1/2009,4,"Very nice frittata.  I actually used leftover Recipe #130567 since it had the same ingredients of zucchini, onions and garlic.  I used seasoning salt in place of table salt with great results. I also added a few dots of ricotta around the top of the frittata (since I need to use it up).    I found cilantro leaves to be a great accent to this dish.  Thanks for a tasty breakfast.   Made for MAKE MY RECIPE.  Thanks"
330545,258050,6/6/2009,5,A wonderful taste with just enough kick to it.  Made as a breakfast treat on this beautiful Saturday morning unfortunately the element on my stove let go and I couldn't finish this under the broiler-not your fault-or mine-it happens.  Made for Aussie RS#29.
17803,258050,8/31/2009,5,I only used 3 cups of zucchini because it looked like a lot of zucchini for 4 eggs.  I also tamed this down a little by using only 2 tablespoons of green chilies because young children were going to eat for lunch.  I used Pace Picante Sauce medium blend to top the frittata.  Made for *Every Day is a Holiday 2009* game.
453440,259175,9/3/2017,5,"These stuffed peppers were excellent! DH loved them and said so. He is a diabetic and it was nice to find a recipe that didn't have rice or bread/bread crumbs in the stuffing. STUFFING: I used 1 1/2lb. hot Italian link sausage meat. After browning the sausage, draining the grease and adding the onion (I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic) I noticed that the meat wasn't broken up as much as I wanted. I put a little more than a cup of the meat in my cusinart and pulsed it a few times. That did the trick and I added it together and then added the cheese. (about a heaping cup) Peppers: I used 6 Med. peppers for the incressed amt. of stuffing and placed the filled peppers in my roasting pan. SAUCE: I didn't have any bottled sauce. I used 3 Cups of homemade meatless sauce. Topped each pepper half with a little. Added a little water to the rest of the sauce and added it to the pan. BAKE TIME: I did 15 Min. @ 400 degrees then lowered to 375 degrees for your total cook time. The peppers were perfect. Your total time was spot on. - Thanks for your post. - PS: The leftovers were just as good reheated."
311051,261427,11/23/2010,3,"Good, but TOO salty! Between the garlic salt and cheese, no additional salt is needed. And I might even use garlic powder instead of garlic salt next time"
522247,286598,2/17/2008,0,"Took a big chance.  The first time I made this was for a big family gathering.  Was a sensational hit.  I do mean everyone wanted the recipe, and they couldn't believe how easy it was to make.  Follow the recipe exactly and you will be worshipped by anyone who takes a bite of it.

131807,286598,2/19/2008,4,"This was really good, more like a cake than brownies though.  The cake was fabulous, but I may try the frosting again with less sugar.  Thanks for posting!"
260975,286598,5/11/2008,5,These were awesome! Everyone enjoyed them which almost never happens. Made for PAC Spring'08
693345,291490,6/21/2010,5,"These are excellent! I took these to a BBQ yesterday, and there wasn't a crumb left. I had actually gotten this recipe in a Cooking Light ad flyer in the mail, and no one could believe it when I told them they were from Cooking Light! The flyer says to bake the brownie layer for 28 minutes, so that's what I did, and they were perfect. I also just used 4 eggs instead of 2 eggs and the egg substitute. After I spread the mint layer on, I stuck the pan in the fridge while I prepared the chocolate layer, because I didn't want the mint and chocolate to swirl together. I actually cut this into 32 squares, which was good, because they are still so sweet, even for being lighter. Several people asked for the recipe. Thanks for posting this!"
1179225,291490,6/8/2011,5,I was going to post this recipe and was so happy to see that you had already done it. I have made these for a few years and they are loved by everyone who tries them. They are a must for anyone who loves chocolate and mint together. As an added bonus they are very pretty. Thanks for posting this great recipe!
209747,340413,11/20/2009,5,What a fast and easy way to serve a great TexMex meal. Perfect for a busy weeknight or any night. Love that it is so flexible and allows each person to add what they like. I really like that this is made with ground turkey too! Healthier than ground beef. I used reduced fat cheese and baked tortilla chips to make it even healthier. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing it!  *Made for My 3 Chefs*
1179225,354530,10/31/2013,4,"Loved the flavors and the end result of this recipe. The directions weren&#039;t very clear. It mentions cooking the broccoli twice, but doesn&#039;t mention broccoli in the list of ingredients. I cooked the tofu and then cut it in strips making it easier to mix with the other ingredients. Thanks for posting the recipe."
2777037,410749,4/9/2013,3,"I would give this five stars for taste.  I only gave it three because the nutritional info is way off.  A can of fat free condensed milk is 1,110 calories, 4 ounces of unsweetened chocolate is 560, and two tbs. of the spread is 90.  That added up is 1,760 calories for the whole recipe.  Divide that be eight and you get 220 calories per serving, not the 84 or so stated. BIG difference!"
583349,415855,4/18/2010,3,"Nice combination of ingredients, but this was way too much lemon for our tastes, and we like tart foods.  If I make again, I will not have the sliced lemon and probably reduce the lemon juice to 1/4-1/3 cup, and maybe add something sweet to tone down the sourness a bit.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for PAC Spring 2010."
88099,471312,4/7/2012,5,"These potatoes were excellent and so creamy.  I loved the hint of nutmeg.  I gave it 3 small shakes, but I'll use more next time.  Used 2% milk and light Smark Balance Butter spread to lighten it up a little.  Loved the addition of the parmesan cheese.  Served this with recipe #413032 and a salad and made for a wonderful meal.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Made for Spring PAC 2012"
286566,482887,7/24/2012,4,"The only changes I made where to use less mayonaise (about 1 tablespoon) and used wholegrain/wholemeal toast bread  for 3 serves which served as a lunch for 1 and the other 2 a snack and required a half a hame and salad sandwich each to finish off)   The salad itslef was superb but found the pesto a little overpowering  overall on the sandwich (and I had used less than recommended) and I used basil pesto but would like to try with a tomato pesto which is a little milder and may let the egg shine trhough more.  Thank you Lavender Lynn, made for Make My Recipe."
2549237,482887,5/9/2014,4,"This was pretty good.  I followed this almost exactly for lunch for myself and my 3 year old son and we both loved it.  I went to serve this and had bought my bread 8 days before and unfortunately it had molded.  I was so disappointed.  I ended up making lettuce wraps with the egg salad and they turned out well, and actually pretty healthy since it was very low carb.  I felt that the pesto was a little much in this and I will leave it out from now on.  I really loved the bacon in this and was surprised that my picky son ate two who lettuce wraps.  Thanks for a great salad Lavender Lynn.  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
9869,20823,8/5/2002,5,"Very tasty soup. My family liked this a lot, I used 2 cans of salmon and chicken stock as opposed to the broth.
Will definitely make this again."
69066,20823,1/27/2003,4,Quite good and very worthwhile.  I added a good bit of pepper to down play the taste of the cream style corn.  The chowder went over well at our Superbowl party.
133174,20823,12/30/2007,5,"Last night was one of those cold dessert nights and this chowder hit the spot.  I doubled the amount of garlic, eliminated the zucchini and used half and half in place of the evaporated milk.  When I make this again, I may increase the amount of dill weed a touch.  The salmon was a can of pink Alaskan salmon.  This was served with oyster crackers for a warm and comforting meal."
337389,20823,1/16/2008,5,Well Mom it was one of those chilly nights in Fla. I had some leftover salmon.Made your Chowder it was wonderful!! I didn't have any zucchini so I left that out. But otherwise follwed your recipe as written. We really enjoyed it. I will definately make this again!!
30534,20823,6/24/2011,5,Delicious.  I made the recipe as directed substituting clam broth for the chicken broth.  I needed to add more liquid than speciified in the recipe. Next time I would add more dill.
58538,55649,5/25/2003,5,"This was excellent. My husband and I both liked it very much. It was simple to make, yet very rich and more complex than I expected. Thanks!"
158443,55649,8/18/2004,5,Fantastic! I made it for a party and received nothing but compliments. Thanks for the recipe.
83093,55649,3/8/2007,5,"Totally agree with the other reviewers - this is excellent! I drizzled it over a salad of mixed greens, dried apricot pieces, toasted almonds and feta cheese. It is a tart dressing so I highly recommend eating it with fruit and cheese to smooth out the flavor. Thanks for sharing!"
222564,55649,11/29/2010,5,Excellent!
6357,107164,12/30/2004,5,One of my favourite smoothies!
69838,152116,1/23/2006,5,Fabulous recipe. Made for a great rotisserie chicken.  I have a toaster oven that does rotisserie and a few other things (bake cookies!!) and it worked really well with this recipe :) Hope you like the photo!!!
56680,152116,3/7/2006,5,"OK, I made this recipe because I went to make my recipe #43685 and found I was out of the storebought spice I ususally use.  This sounded close and it was PERFEFCT!  I used it called for in my recipe and it came out right on, I think I will not be buying it anymore, just making my own, thanks for a keeper!"
220420,152116,3/11/2006,5,"Not only did I impress my DH, and guests with this fabulous recipe,,I impressed myself as well. Next time I make 2 so there will be leftovers. Thank You!!"
25792,152116,4/25/2006,5,I wish I had an indoor rotisserie cause I would be doing chickens ALL the time.  I did this on outdoor grill attachment and it was wonderful.  I didnt change 1 thing and only wish I had done 2 instead of 1. When chickens are on sale I will be doing this a lot in the summer and then freezing them. Thanks for a great recipe!
64154,152116,4/30/2006,5," Great chicken. I rubbed the outside of the chicken with the spice mixture and rubbed the inside with what was left. Refrigerated for 18 hours. The chicken turned out tender and moist with a great crispy and tasty skin. I would have like the spices to have permeateded the meat more. Thus the 4 stars. Don't know it will work on the rotisserie, but next time I will make several small slits in the skin and rub some of the spices under the skin. I do this to my smoked turkeys. Its a keeper and I will make it again. — Apr 27, 2006

124249,152116,5/14/2006,5,"Made this as one of the meats for a graduation party. The guest liked it. Refrigerated mine overnight. 

Thanks bailey46

Bullwinkle."
171303,152116,6/1/2006,5,This is REALLY a great rub for rotisserie chicken.  I did cut back on the salt and added half mild & half hot paprika and the flavor was just marvelous. The chicken was wonderfully juicy and the skin nice & crispy. Next time I think I'll experiment with some smoked paprika. Thank you Bailey48 for sharing the recipe. 
335737,152116,8/15/2006,5,"Oh my, how good! Its a keeper for sure! It is wonderful! I am using the leftover chicken today in Jill4man's ""The best chicken Tortilla soup"". Hope it turns out to be a keeper too, then I'll have to great recipes in one little chicken!"
48920,152116,12/26/2006,5,Delicious!  First thing we made on our new rotisserie.  It smelled divine while cooking and the meat just fell off the bone.  Made some awesome sour cream chicken enchiladas with the leftovers.

49168,152116,3/5/2007,5,"We love ""spinning a chicken"" on our rotisserie.  This is a great marinade, I add a squeeze of lemon juice."
29782,152116,3/8/2007,5,"This was delicious! I preped this and let it chill all morning til time to put in the rotisserie oven. The seasonings were just wonderful,gave the chicken a delicious flavor and it was so moist and tender. I baked mine for 90 minutes but I did have a 3 pound whole chicken. I also only used half the seasoning measurements since my chicken was smaller than recipe calls for. 
Thanks for sharing your recipe bailey46! Its a keeper :)"
433021,152116,3/22/2007,5,So far this is the best Rotisserie Chicken my family has had. My kids ate all the leftovers. And that says alot. Thank you for posting.
230331,152116,5/17/2007,5,Thanks for a great recipe!  This was excellent.  We just got a new grill and bought a rotisserie for it and couldn't wait to use it.  I had a very small chicken and used all the spices inside and out.  As it was cooking I wanted to pick pieces off it smelled that good.  And when it was time to eat it tasted even better.
401711,152116,5/24/2007,5,Fantastic! Since going gluten free I can't have the deli chickens anymore and I decided to make my own. This is better than any deli chicken I've ever bought! Thanks!
88099,152116,7/6/2007,5,Excellent chicken.  Loved the combination of flavors in this. Perfect
949194,305675,9/8/2008,5,Very good â€“Â perfect recreation of a favorite restaurant. I substituted the chicken thighs for thin chicken breast; and then did a quick pan fry of everything in there.
430663,152116,7/9/2007,5,"While mixing the seasoning blend, I had to stop and write my thoughts...this is the most wonderful combination of spices that I have ever tasted! I had recently discovered a Caribbean Jerk seasoning that I loved, but your blend is far better! I cannot wait to try the finished chicken dish...I am sure thaqt it will also be a 5-star rating!

Post note:  The chicken came out perfect after exactly 1 1/2 hours in my rotisserie oven.  The meat was full of flavor...thanks for a great recipe!"
491949,152116,8/18/2007,5,Excellent recipe.  I cooked in in my counter-top rotisserie and i came out great.  My family is already asking for me to make this again.
215898,152116,8/23/2007,5,"We had technical difficulties with the rotisserie so ended up cooking this in the oven, but everyone loved it!  The skin was crispy and flavorful, and the meat was juicy and tender.  I plan to make this spice mix in quantity and store it for easy use."
515964,152116,10/7/2007,5,This came out just as it says juicy with a crisp skin. I did'nt even marinade it and it was still absolutley delicious.
53868,152116,2/10/2008,5,"Absolutely delicious. I had never thought of marinating the chicken overnight with a rub on it; it really helps the flavor permeate the chicken. We used two smaller free-range chickens on the rotisserie; it worked fine. The skin wasn't really that crispy, but who cares? It was incredibly juicy and yummy anyway."
454149,152116,3/28/2008,5,"We love this chicken, but you have to make sure that you season the inside cavity as well as the outside. I even used the full amount of paprika, when ususally we cut it also because its too spicey for us. Thanks for the recipe!"
585211,152116,7/2/2008,5,We love this recipe!  thank you so much for posting it.  My family LOVES this chicken.
650938,152116,9/25/2008,5,I use this every time I rotisserie a chicken now.  It is perfect...The whole family can't get enough.
11176,152116,11/25/2008,5,"GAAH! I need moar! Oh wait... I have the recipe, I'll just make another one. This was my very first use of a rotisserie and I'm not turning back. The seasoning was SO good, I had to eat the crispy skin, too. There, I said it. I ate the skin! Many thanks for this wonderful recipe, bailey46!"
952408,152116,12/8/2008,5,This was my first time cooking with a rotisserie! I will probably experiment more but this recipe has been saved in my cookbook. I grill ribs and will use this on them.   VERY TASTY!
434493,152116,1/25/2009,2,I really didn't care for this recipe at all.  I will going onto the next recipe for rotisserie chicken.
520002,152116,3/12/2009,5,"Very good. Did on rotisserie with chicken legs. I added 1 tsp. Pappy's seasoning and 1 tsp. lemon zest also. Next time I will add 1 tsp. corriander instead of thyme. Good flavor, everyone liked."
251626,152116,6/21/2009,5,Loved it.
169969,152116,7/14/2009,5,"I agree with love4culinary, fabulous recipe. I only let the seasonings sit on the chicken for about an hour before I put it in the rotisserie. It was wonderful with excellent flavor! Thanks for posting!

7/14/09 Made this for dinner tonight and it was as fabulous as I remembered!"
494440,152116,12/20/2009,5,"I used curry powder instead of chili powder due to availability here in China, and I'm sure this changed the taste a bit, but still quite a wonderful rub for the chicken.  Came out delicious."
1477212,152116,1/6/2010,4,Seemed to be what we were looking for.
302094,152116,1/31/2010,5,We had to grill our chicken  our rotisserie wasn't working. This tasted great and everyone loved it. Thanks for posting!
844554,152116,2/15/2010,5,I don't have a rotisserie so I baked mine in the oven. I used this recipe for the spices -- it looked like a combo of what I was looking for and it was. It was very good. Thanks for giving me another choice for chicken!
1527940,152116,5/5/2010,5,"FantasticRecipe!!! Made right by the recipe, didn't change anything. Refrigerated about 6 1/2 hours. While cooking it smelled great. In my GF rotisserie I cooked 17 min. per pound, per GF instructions. What left overs? Next time I will make 2. This was so good, don't think it could be better. Thanks bailey46."
317606,152116,5/15/2010,5,Most excellent!  My husband and I fixed two whole chickens on our grill rotisserie on our Broil King and cooked for a little over 1-1/2 hours.  This rub is fantastic!  Best rotisserie chicken ever!  I will definitely use this recipe all the time for rotisserie chicken!  Thanks!
1221306,152116,6/19/2010,5,Delicious!  Better than I expected.
648882,152116,7/18/2010,5,"Love-Love-Love this!  No more grocery store rotisserie chickens for us.  This is now a Monday routine.  We have chicken to snack on, chicken sandwiches for lunch and whatever is left in a couple days makes a delicious chicken salad."
439759,152116,8/15/2010,5,"Great recipe!  I used our Member's Mark Grill at 350 degrees with only the far right burner burning.  It took over 2 hours to get it to 175 degrees, but that could have a lot to do with our high altitude.  I think next time I will up the cooking temperature to 400 degrees for the first 20 minutes and then bring it back to 350 and see what happens.  I stuck some rub betweend the skin and meat and it tasted wonderful.  The meat was also very juicy.  Thank you!"
8629,152116,8/22/2010,4,"This was the first recipe I tried on my Showtime Rotisserie. Based on instructions for the Showtime Rotisserie,  I set the timer for 1 hour and 15 minutes for the 4 lb. chicken.  That timing was fine. I liked these seasonings very much."
192849,152116,9/11/2010,5,Made rub as directed as prepared chicken the morning  before I cooked it.  It had about 34 hours to absorb all that goodness.  Threw it on the rotisserie for 90 minutes.  The smell as it cooked was incredible.  This was the best rotisserie chicken I've made.  DH and I were licking our fingers.  Thanks for sharing!
135887,152116,5/23/2011,5,Made as directed.  My 5 lb chicken was ready in 1 hour 45 minutes using the rotisserie on our gas grill.  Very moist and tasty results.
447742,152116,9/10/2011,5,"We don't have a rotisserie, so I used this recipe for the rub only, and add a generous 1/4 tsp of ground cayenne pepper - Very tasty!  I'll then either bake in the oven, or cook in the crock-pot.  The crock-pot method makes for a flavorful, fall-off-the-bone chicken. Mmmmm..."
19372,152116,5/28/2012,5,"Wow!  My hubby picked up a chicken and hinted we should use the Rotisserie.  Today I decided to do just that.  The only thing I did different from this recipe was I used a brown sugar blend instead of regular sugar. The smell flowing through the house had everyone drooling. This was SO good!  We had company come by and they loved it, too. Thanks so much for posting it!"
173579,152116,6/29/2012,5,Very good recipe for rotisserie chicken.  We all liked it.  Thanks for posting.
2291867,152116,7/2/2012,5,Absolutely the best deli chicken....a family favorite.
889181,152116,8/23/2012,0,"Wow! was this ever delicious and easy! I came home from work, mixed up the spice rub, rubbed it on the chicken, put chicken in refrierator for 2 hours, sat on the veranda having a cocktail, put chicken on rotisserie on the bbq, and 45 minutes later, dinner was done. the chicken was moist and flavourful.I served with boiled new potatoes with dill and butter and some little tomatoes from the garden made into a salad. the Chicken was the star of the night. Well done, bailey46! a new regular meal in our household."
2764527,152116,3/31/2013,5,Amazing recipe &amp; so easy as my hubby did all the work =) We didn&#039;t use the sugar - that is the only change.  We will make this again &amp; again &amp; again!
176481,152116,6/17/2013,4,"Made this for our grillin&#039; weekend.  We used 2 half bone-in breasts.  I love the skin, but my boyfriend doesn&#039;t so I rubbed some of the spices inside the skin as well as on top.  I thought it was good, not fantastic.  I personally didn&#039;t feel the spices were balanced, some overpowered others.  The chicken was still very juicy.  We will do this again but tweak the spices a bit.  Thanks for posting, it gave us a foundation to work with."
2156777,152116,5/13/2014,5,"This is my new favorite recipe for rotisseries.  It is sooooo good.  I didn&#039;t let the chicken sit with the rub for a few hours and it was STILL good.  Also, I know it is recommended to wash the chicken, but as gross as this may sound, Consumer Reports recently said it is best not to wash chicken as the bacteria will go away with cooking and washing it spreads the germs around the kitchen.  Just a thought.  If you don&#039;t want to know that bit of info., just don&#039;t eat at my house -- I follow Consumer Reports :).  Overall, a very good recipe, left the chicken outsides crispy and my kids&#039; insides full.  Thanks for sharing."
1802734451,152116,7/13/2014,5,I adjusted the recipe for a 5 lb chicken and the following ingredients. And it was absolutely delicious. I had no garlic powder so I used garlic salt. But I also used the recommended salt it also called for. Instead of regular chili powder I used Hot Mexican Style Chili Powder and also added equal amounts of Brown sugar to the rub. I mixed all ingredients well and put into empty herb container and sprinkled evenly over evoo rubbed roast inside and out. Marinated in fridge 24 hrs. Made a delicious crispy amber brown skin and juicy throughout. It&#039;s a keeper.
12657319,152116,12/31/2014,5,"Outstanding recipe and beats the grocery store chickens by a mile. I used a grille pan with ridges to hold the chicken off the drippings and then convection baked a 4.15lb bird for 1:30 at 350 actual degrees (setting for 375) for the first half hour, then tented with foil for the last hour. I increased the temp to 400 for the last half hour. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Came out superb. Baked it weighed 3lbs,and when I took all the meat off, I got 2lbs.  I paid $1.79 per lb and it was the equivalent of buying boneless skinless for $2.99 after getting rid of the bone, but tasted way better. The skin and bone adds a ton of flavor, as does this rub. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I found smoked paprika at trader joes and it worked really well. It gave it a BBQ potato chips sort of flavor that was very very subtle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Less than a week later, I&#039;m making another, larger one. It&#039;s that good!"
2000161637,152116,8/24/2015,3,"No oven temperature is given :-(

I&#039;ll try:

 Cook for 15 minutes at 425&deg;F, 220&deg;C  and then reduce the heat to 375&deg;F, 190&deg;C

And no rest time is given either - about 15 minutes before carving the chicken."
1802582540,152116,10/16/2016,5,"This was great. We are doing low carb so I was looking for rub with no sugar. Perfect! I spatchcocked the chicken and rubbed season on generously. Put breast down on hot BBQ (450) for 15 mins, flipped for 30 minutes. Until temp reached 165F. Will make again and again. Ty"
2001289013,152116,12/9/2016,5,Great rub! Chicken was really moist and tasty!
2001345092,152116,1/29/2017,5,"Delicious!!! This was my first rotisserie, I have always bought mine from Costco but this recipe beats them all. I will never buy another rotisserie chicken again!"
2001356191,152116,1/17/2018,4,"Overall, it was very good. Can't say I was entirely blown away but I recognize that part of that could have been because I couldn't follow all the directives to a &quot;t&quot;. Here are a few things I did differently: I didn’t find this recipe until right before I was going to put the chickens in the oven so I didn’t have the benefit of letting it soak in the rub ahead of time. I just made it up and put it directly in the oven. I doubled the recipe (I had two chickens) but kept all of the spice ratios the same except for the chili powder – which I cut in half (because we’re wimps). I used coconut sugar instead of regular for a smidge extra nutrition. I liberally seasoned the inside of the bird as well (and still had rub left over). We have a rotisserie but I didn’t have time to fiddle with it so I just made them on a rack, in a roaster, in the oven at 400. I did have to move them around after a bit as the rub was getting too dark. Next time, I’d like to try this when it has a chance to marinate overnight first and then do it on the rotisserie for the full effect. Still, it got good reviews from the fam. The skin was crisp and had flavor and the meat was juicy and tender. The reason for only 4 stars is, the rub itself was good but it didn't totally knock my socks off. I might tweak some of the seasonings for a better balance and outcome as it speaks to our particular taste buds (e.g.: more garlic powder and black pepper and maybe rub with melted butter instead of oil). Worth the try and will look forward to making it again. Thanks for the good dinner!"
2001965699,152116,2/1/2018,4,It was good. Just did not think it was great.
2001971575,152116,2/3/2018,5,"This was really yummy, best to do the make ahead so it has time to marinate in the spice rub, makes a difference in the flavor profile! Also READERS, this is a ROTISSERIE chicken recipe so there will be no oven temperature settings. READ the title of the recipe and then actually READ the recipe- it's stated there too! I love how people get all bent out of shape about something and get all mean and nasty but it's simply because they don't READ THE RECIPE!!! lol"
2002002895,152116,5/12/2018,5,I'm glad I found this recipe! My friend gave me a George Foreman rotisserie oven a few months ago and I finally put it to use. The chicken turned out juicy and delicious. I'm so excited that I can add this recipe to my collection.
2000927928,152116,9/21/2018,5,"I used some of the seasoning in the cavity of the bird and trussed it. Put it on the rotisserie on my gas grill set at 350-375 degrees with a disposable pan under the bird with chicken stock and butter in it. Temped at 1 hour, not done. Temped at 1-1/2 hrs and was perfect. Thighs were 175 and the breast was 165. This was amazing!!! Kinda hard to get excited about a rotisserie chicken but this recipe is a keeper. Oh yeah. I also used a smoker box with hickory pellets in it to give the bird a kiss of smoke."
254614,164143,4/13/2006,5,"I put some Hormel cooked bits and pieces in my eggs with butter. Good! I cooked another with margarine, eggs and cheese whiz for DH and he liked with pepper.You are so right, no mess! Amen."
95743,164143,4/14/2006,5,"Left this recipe out on the kitchen counter with a note to Dh that he might like it for breakfast.  When I got up he had left me a thank you note and instructions to cook the eggs for two minutes with a sprinkling of cheese.  Thanks for a no-fail, tasty recipe, Krsi Sue."
310874,164143,4/14/2006,5,"I have been making something very similar at work for a while now, except I microwave it the same way in a coffee mug.  :)  Yummy breakfast!"
342784,164143,8/24/2006,5,"A quick and easy way to make scrambled eggs.  Three minutes would have probably scorched my eggs so I'd recommend paying close attention after each minute.  Also make sure that you get a light layer of oil on all parts of your bowl or else you'll get a couple of parts that stick like I did.  If not for that, I could easily just rinse out the bowl and be done cleaning!  Definitely should add some meat, diced onions, cheese or something to help make this recipe even more flavorful else it's just a scrambled egg in a no-stick bowl."
176843,164143,2/9/2007,4,Thanks for reminding me how simple it is to make a quick egg or two for breakfast!!  I used to do this all the time when I was a single 20-something and didn't want to take the time to cook.  I tried this out for myself using only egg whites and some soy cheese and it was as satisfying as I remember!
324993,164143,2/15/2007,5,Love it! Easy and tasty!
377581,164143,5/8/2009,4,It's easy to cook. I added a slice of american cheese a minute before it was ready. Made a great breakfast with hash browns and thick sliced toast. Thank you!
499050,164143,8/29/2009,4,Very Good.
863904,164143,9/3/2009,0,as i am yet to try this i will refrain from starring this recipe just yet. but i will say this sounds a great recipe and i will try this - should be a nice and easy thing to make for my toddler on those cold mornings or even as a side with his dinner! thanks for the idea:)
400708,164143,12/22/2010,5,"This was such a fun recipe, easy and quick and actually looked really pretty on the plate.  I had an extra egg yolk left over from making meringue cookies so added that to it with some fresh grated chedder cheese and it puffed up like a cheese souffle (sp)and did at the pat of butter on the plate.  What a great idea when you are in a hurry and don't want to make a mess.  Think this could have a lot of additions, maybe bacan or ham - yum and what an easy way to make that egg bagel sandwich in the morning."
350750,164143,11/20/2011,5,I often make these eggs for my toddler son and he loves them.
121690,178717,7/28/2006,4,"This is when I'm so sorry that I'm a chef without a camera. This salad is just supremely beautiful. I served it on a bed of baby spinach which set off the colors very well. The combination of ingredients in the salad melds together well.  The ratio of oil to lemon juice in the dressing, though, dilutes the lemon presence enough that it comes through only faintly. I think the next time I make the salad, I'll try adding a bit of grated lemon zest to the dressing to up the lemony tang I was looking for. Still, I will definitely be trying it again. Thanks, Caroline Olivia!"
374416,178717,3/27/2007,4,"This was very pretty!  I added about 1/4 cup of chopped carrot and 1 more avocado (since I had it).  As in the previous review, I thought that it needed a little more lemon flavor.  Adding some lemon zest, more lemon juice, or maybe 1 lemon, sectioned, would probably do the trick.  This would be yummy as a wrap or stuffed in a pita!  Thanks kiwi, I will make this again!"
377070,178717,6/15/2007,5,"*edit June 15, 2007 - I initially gave this recipe a four star rating.  Since then I've found myself telling people about it and having cravings for it.  That tells me I totally underrated it the first time.
This was a very good salad and will definitely be making again. I had a large group to feed so added 6 cups of baby spring greens and used small shrimp instead of large. I did add 1 Tbsp more lemon juice to the dressing but it wasn't quite enough for our tastes. We like a bit more of a bite, so next time I think I'll add 3 Tbsp of lemon juice plus some dijon mustard and a dash or two of hot sauce. Maybe even a wee bit of minced garlic too."
872058,178717,6/25/2008,3,"These chosen ingredients are fabulous together (color and taste-wise) but this recipe needed much much more salt, pepper and lemon juice to make the flavors come out. I used fresh everything for the ingredients. I am pretty sensitive to too-salty foods so I was surprised that I needed to use more than 2 tablespoons of Krazy lemon salt to give all the ingredients the normal level of flavor. I would definitely make this again but with some adjustments to the lemon, salt and pepper measurements."
199848,178717,6/18/2012,5,"I loved that this salad had a light, lemony taste and not bogged down by heavy mayonnaise.  I used extra-large shrimp.  I think the bigger the shrimp, the better for this salad.  This is a great alternative to lettuce-based salads, although this would be great served on a bed of green or lettuce.  Thanx for sharing!"
2001343889,178717,1/9/2017,0,"I was looking for a recipe to using up and excess of shrimp and celery I had left over. Every other recipe I found needed &quot;two cups of mayonnaise.&quot; But this recipe does not and proves that artery clogging mayonnaise does not need to be the base of a delicious, healthy salad. I've made it five times in the last two months since finding it. Thank you so much."
380862,197991,5/3/2007,5,These are easy and delicious! They are always a hit at my parties.
128473,197991,3/16/2011,5,"These were excellent Luckydevil.  I used jalapeno pepper jelly couldn't find peach pepper jelly. These tasted so much better than my pictures look.  Quick and very easy to make. Love brie, love puff pastry and pepper jelly, tailer made for me.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Made for Pac 2011."
424680,257453,11/27/2008,5,"An interesting way to make a Monte Cristo! I actually cut the recipe in half & that, along with a bowl of soup, made a great lunch for 2 of us (not to mention cutting way back on the calories, fat, cholesterol, etc)! Not something I'd make often, but since this is one of my very favorite sandwiches, well . . . Thanks for a great recipe! [Tagged, made & reviewed as part of my Lunchtime Sandwich theme in My-3-Chefs]"
228392,273854,12/31/2007,5,"I made this for a surprise birthday party on Saturday and got great compliments on it.  Because we had quite a few people invited to the party, I doubled the cream cheese and sour cream and used about a cup of hot sauce. I didn't have a can of chicken, so I used some finely shredded chicken that I had in the freezer and had thawed. I will definitely be making this again!"
538563,273854,12/23/2008,5,"This is a really good and really easy dip to make. I didn't add as much hot sauce as the recipe calls for, as I wanted my daughters to be able to eat it. I added 2 teaspoons of chili powder to add extra flavor without the ""heat"" of the hot sauce. Great recipe!"
174096,305675,1/17/2010,5,"This is great!  The meat comes out so juicy and flavorful!  I omitted the salt and used fat free Greek yogurt with the hummus.  So good!  I took advantage of a good sale on chicken leg quarters, so I cooked both thighs and drumsticks this way and used the thighs as directed.  The drumsticks were great sliced over a salad with Greek dressing for lunch the next day!  Thanks for sharing!"
1329782,305675,1/26/2010,5,"Very good.
I used a combination of 4 breasts with bone in and 6 thighs, because it was what I had, so I used a bit more marinade, but same ingredients.  I did let mine marinade all day which I thought really helped.

I grilled mine, but only took 30 minutes to grill, it says 1 hour. Mine was 30 minutes and perfectly tender.  I did baste as directions stated.

I used seedless cucumbers and plum tomatoes, also seeded, otherwise, the Naan (I had it on hand, so I used that but Pita would of been great) would of got too wet for me. I added, black olives rough chopped as well which I like with the flavors and I had a 1/2 of can so why not use them up.

Very good, will make again.  A great sandwich
Thx!!"
1800103922,305675,10/5/2013,3,"Very good! Not quite like the ones you get on the street in New York or Europe, but very close and my craving was satisfied! I recommend this recipe to anyone craving a D&ouml;ner kebab! These are tasty and pretty easy to make too."
1802533639,305675,2/27/2014,5,"Absolutely yummy. It tastes as good, if not better than the chicken doner from my local kebab house."
806937,310344,8/16/2009,4,Very good and moist. I made a 1/2 recipe and will add some chocolate chips to the cheesecake part next time.
4470,362145,9/8/2009,5,Very nice but I used Tony Chachere's Roux Mix instead of making it from scratch. I had to make adjustments to the recipe as a result. Also I cannot get craw fish so I used artificial crab. It did end up as a very tasty dinner. With all the adjustments due to my laziness I cannot in fairness take away stars so will make it a 5 star - I am sure it deserves it because even with all my fiddling this was still a very tasty dinner . When I can get crawfish I will make this recipe again and make the roux from scratch.  I didn't think that using the Instant Roux would give me so many problems.
895132,383128,12/6/2009,5,"Clear five stars!!! Actually made it to use in recipe #306275 but it's fantastic on it's own! Maybe because I used rice syrup instead of sugar and 80 percent chocolate instead of 65 percent it's extremely smooth and velvety. I don't like those watery chocolate sorbets, so this one definitely is it for me! This will be my standard chocolate sorbet.
Thanks for posting!"
346338,16289,9/9/2006,5,"I made this a few years ago, from the godiva chocolate website. Absolutely 1000% fab, should have 10 stars cannot say enough about it,honestly speechless, Its only downfall is time and can be tricky. but if you choose to make it you will not be dissapointed."
42586,21132,1/2/2003,5,"I'm trying to learn better ways to cook oatmeal so that I'll enjoy eating it more often.  This is really good!  I really liked a different baked oatmeal dish, so thought I would try this one.  This one is nothing like the other, but is also really good.  I used blueberries instead od cranberries.  It is nice to eat oatmeal that isn't too sweet!  Thanks!"
22015,21132,5/25/2004,5,This is wonderful!  Very flavorful.  The oatmeal isn't mushy - it's still a bit chewy -just the way I like it.  I cut the recipe in half except for the butter and brown sugar - I used less than half of those.  It worked out very well.  I think that this would be great in Cooked Oatmeal Scones #46876.  I'll make extra next time so that I can do just that with the leftovers.  Thanks for a great recipe.
104847,21132,9/14/2004,5,"This was great.  Easy to make and have ready for the morning.  I made small changes with what I had available.  used maple syrup instead of sugar, 4 1/2 T ground flax in place of margarine, 1 c. apple, raisins instead of cranberries, and 2/3c. chopped almonds.  "
86855,21132,9/20/2004,5,"This makes such a nice autumn breakfast! And it looks really pretty too! I used half cranberries and half raisins. Also, I didn't have 3 cups of milk on hand, so I substituted some water to make a total of 3 cups liquid. The leftovers are delicious too! Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Tish!"
140806,21132,12/27/2004,5,Surprisingly easy recipe. I made this Christmas morning and it turned out perfect. I used orange craisins which enhanced the wonderful flavor even more. This became a recipe that I will look forward to making every Christmas.
2001017894,32082,5/19/2016,5,I loved the recipe...it came out perfect the first time I tried!!
173838,21132,2/15/2005,5,"Thanks, Tish, for a new breakfast favorite!  I halved the recipe, as well as mixed cranberries with raisins.  It turned out great--smelled wonderful when it was baking too!   I appreciate a baked oatmeal recipe that doesn't call for eggs.  I think any baked oatmeal is especially tasty, however, because the flavors blend well while baking.  Thanks again!"
21173,21132,6/5/2005,5,"Excellent! I had some left over and am going to see if it freezes well, as i think it could make a great microwave quickie breakfast option. The DH wanted to have a second bowl!"
182358,21132,7/23/2005,5,"Yummy!  I made the recipe as posted but omitted the nuts b/c was preparing for granchildren. I also used a mixture of dried berries (cherries, cranberries, blueberries) and tossed in a cut up banana as I needed to use  some up. My DS and DIL loved it. I really enjoyed the dried fruit and will definitely be making this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing, Tish!"
95743,21132,11/10/2005,0,"Made this just as written, expecting to like it, but I'm afraid neither one of us cared for it.  Just a personal taste thing, I guess."
215898,21132,2/26/2006,0,The flavor was good but we didn't care for the texture. I wish I could be more specific but I can't seem to find the right words. Judging by the other reviews it may just be a personal taste thing.
119708,21132,4/23/2006,5,I didn't do the star thing!!  Ooops...is certainly a 5'er.  I have made this again and even my dh liked it and he won't touch oatmeal!  His mom raved about it from the brunch so he gave it a try...
100185,21132,5/13/2006,4,"I liked this except it was very very sweet, and I didn't even use the whole amount of brown sugar.  But the rest of it was good and I'm sure I'll be making it again, and maybe use only 1 tablespoon of sugar."
133174,21132,9/24/2006,5,Great recipe!  I used Splenda brown sugar blend and reduced the amount of cranberries and pecans to 1/2 cup each.  The one thing I really enjoyed about this recipe is there is no overnight preparation.  It is quick and makes for a delciious breakfast.
271347,21132,1/13/2007,5,"Excellent!  I use fresh, whole cranberries, upping the quantity to 1 1/2 c. and doubling the brown sugar.  To reduce calories, skip the margarine and/or butter, you don't really need to oil the pan. 

I make this sometimes a day ahead of when I have overnight company; just reheat in the morning for a plentiful, tasteful breakfast."
47892,21132,2/11/2007,5,"I live off oatmeal in the cold months and this was a very delicious recipe! Very minor changes: grated the apples instead of chopped, almonds because I was out of the other nuts, and a combination of dried orange essence cranberries and dried blueberries. To serve, I sprinkled some salt on top and also a sprinkle of brown sugar. Half and half cream was served on the side. Thanks for sharing."
181123,21132,4/7/2007,5,Great!  The combo of apples and cinnamon is a winner!
404046,21132,6/22/2007,5,"This is my favorite recipe for oatmeal in the morning!  It has a great balance of cinnamon, sweetness and crunch from the nuts.  The only change I've done is 2% milk and butter instead of margarine.  Thank you, Tish!"
540680,21132,10/9/2007,5,"Delightful...I've tried this with several kinds of nuts and raisins instead of cranberries...quite a filling ""Good morning,"" from the world of oats."
719493,21132,2/23/2008,5,Wonderful!!!!  Great for the weekend and for company!!
664685,21132,3/3/2008,5,"From the hands of a novice chef--really great!  Made one pan for my family and another for my girlfriend and it was gone.  This is a keeper.  I added more cranberries than the recipe called for.  Apples seem to be optional, don't reallyl add much (next time, I will try w/o)."
28177,21132,5/3/2008,5,"Loved the balance in this oatmeal. The top baked up nice & firm with a dry appearance, but the underneath was soft & moist. I used one granny smith apple, 2% milk, cranberries & pecans.  I think that even though it wasn't a full 1-1/2 cups, the tart apple was a prominent flavor.  The brown sugar was plenty to sweeten the recipe & since we don't usually put milk or yogurt on oatmeal (pers pref), we enjoyed this recipe plain.  DH was experiementing with maple syrup & with butter. He didn't like it with syrup at all (too sweet), but thought it best with a dab of butter mixed in. DS, DD & I ate it plain. I love that this recipe can be made with staple ingredients. I usually like to make the first recipe as printed, and since I'll be making this again I'm going to use dried cherries & add a touch of almond extract to the mixture next time. Thanks for posting Tish, this is a fantastic recipe!"
540142,21132,5/9/2008,5,"sooooo good. everyone loved it! i used vanilla soymilk instead of regular milk, also i would use less sugar next time, it was a little too sweet for me, but overall, wonderful!"
207668,21132,5/21/2008,5,"Easy enough for my older children to prepare without help and yet so delicious that everyone wants seconds!  

I used rice milk since we are a no-dairy family, and omitted the apple as I had none.  Still absolutely wonderful.

Thank you for a flexible recipe that is sure to become a breakfast staple in our home."
362983,21132,12/11/2008,5,"Delicious oatmeal! Now why was I making oatmeal in the microwave all this time???? This was actually really fun to make and easy to put together. I loved that you didn't have to let it soak overnight like other recipes. The only changes I made was cutting down the sugar (though I might add the listed amount to compare next time) and I used half cranberries, half raisins. I think I might have added too much milk because it didn't firm up, so I'll try cutting that down next time too. I can't wait to try this with different fruits and seasonings. Thank you!"
46357,21132,10/8/2009,5,"This is really good! I agree - might never eat oatmeal any other way from now on. I've made it twice and now add about 1/2 tsp salt, extra tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla to the milk mixture. This seems to bring out the flavors better. YUM!!

FYI, it's 5 WW pts per serving without the nuts."
237123,21132,1/12/2010,5,"loved it.  I really changed it quite a bit, but you provided me with the perfect proportions, temp and time.  I used a 10 grain hot cereal, almond milk, agave nectar, cinnamon, almonds and apples.  I divided it up into 6 sections to eat for breakfasts during the week.  I would make this again for sure."
225620,21132,3/21/2010,5,"I loved this recipe! My only adjustment was to leave out the nuts, personal preference. I used a large apple for which I do not know the measurement. I also let the oatmeal sit for about five minutes before cutting and serving to allow the liquid to be soaked in, again personal preference. This will be great to reheat before work in the morning."
704479,21132,6/15/2010,5,"Just got around to rating it now, but it's a Saturday morning staple in our household.  Great texture, great taste, very simple. Thank you!"
421511,21132,1/10/2011,4,"Very good!  I didn't have any apples on hand, so left them out.  I did use vanilla almond milk, so I decreased the brown sugar to 3 tbs and found it to be the perfect sweetness.  It took about 40 minutes.  Next time, I''ll bump up the temp to 375.  I'm looking forward to trying to this with other dried fruit/nut combos.  Thank you for posting!"
213139,21132,2/6/2011,5,"DD has been asking for baked oatmeal for several weeks and I finally got around to baking some for her.  I used dried cherries as I had some that needed to be used up, a granny smith apple and pecans (our favorite nut for baking). It smelled heavenly while baking and the taste was wonderful.  A nice change from regular oatmeal.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for posting this Tish!  Made for Healthy Choices ABC Tag."
302094,27266,3/21/2007,4,I just made this for dinner as a side dish to my southwest tamale pie. The only changes I made was to add Thousand Island dressing thats all I had on hand. I also added kidney beans instead of ranch style beans. I forgot the cheese but it was still tasty. Thanks for a quick side dish for dinner.
60908,27509,11/13/2002,5,"Hi Georgieanna,

Growing up in Louisiana, this is exactly the way my Mama would make ""Lost Bread"". I'd forgotten all about it. Now I'm going to fix it for breakfast tomorrow morning. Thanks for reminding me with the recipe! By the way, I live nearby in Covington."
160213,27509,9/18/2004,5,"We were looking for a simple classic French Toast just like mom would make,and we found it. Thank you..        P.S. I am also from southern Louisiana,Morgan City "
371105,27509,4/1/2007,5,this definitely the way my children are going to grow up eating frech toast.
126104,27509,10/6/2007,5,"I have absolutely never heard of ""lost bread"", and this wasn't how I have always HAD it, but it will be how I always have it.  This was absolutely delicious.

I was craving french toast tonite after reading another review, and searched for one that sounded good without being lots of trouble (or overnight).  I'm so glad I found this one.

Absolutely delicious."
549460,27509,3/4/2008,5,This makes the best french toast ever.  I have never been able to make good french toast until now.
873008,27509,2/6/2010,5,"Fantastic and easy!!  I always have ""lost bread,"" sometimes a little too much.  Thanks so much for the recipe."
1648730,27509,7/15/2010,5,"My husband and I tried this recipe for breakfast this morning.  We often have leftover Hawaiian bread from communion each Sunday, so I used that for the bread.  It really did not need syrup at all - but we used some! Yum!"
2001028303,27509,9/22/2018,5,I'm from New Orleans and My Mawmaw used to make this for us every weekend. Brings back great memories.
43642,77337,8/16/2004,5,"I was about to do some experimenting myself with salmon and Liquid Smoke when I ran across this recipe. This is so easy to make, and it does really taste great.  I used the maximum amount of Liquid Smoke listed.  After the second refrigeration, I skinned and boned the salmon, which was super-easy.  When I tasted it, I thought it was good but I wanted it smokier - so I added probably another 2 Tablespoons of Liquid Smoke and refrigerated it a couple more hours.  I thought it was perfect then.  I used some to make a salmon pasta dish (I will post the recipe - it was GOOD!), and the rest went in the freezer for later.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe - it was just what I was looking for!"
718620,202788,7/25/2010,5,"really yummy waffles - i didn't have orange zest, and i'm not a fan of nuts, so i omitted both, and they still turned out wonderful.  A definite keeper.  thanks"
1169601,97258,2/14/2009,5,"I've made a recipe very similar to this for years.  It was in the Better Homes and Gardens Summertime Grilling cookbook.  I misplaced my copy, and found this one called Bean Quartet as well.  Any way, I have started just putting it in a crock pot and slow cooking in while I am preparing the rest of my food.  It is always a crowd pleaser, and very easy to make.  

Note - the 1 ounce cans is obviously a mistake.  My recipe had one 15 ounce can of each of the beans except the pork and beans.  That was 22 ounces or so."
158446,164312,12/16/2007,3,"The combination of the banana with the caramel was great.  This took much longer than stated in the recipe to bake though.  The glaze was too much, so I reserved some & poured it over each slice to serve."
1138230,164312,3/17/2012,5,"You may not have given credit to Southern Living which is where I got this recipe. It came out in 1998 sometime. However, thanks for posting it. I didn't have time to let the cake cool completely so the caramel sauce basically soaked in to the warm cake which was delicious. Took it to a baby shower & everyone wanted the recipe. I also didn't have shortening so used all butter & I added a second banana for even more flavor.  Not only yummy, but it's a great use for overripe bananas!"
1800095597,164312,10/2/2013,5,"I don&#039;t even like bananas but my family does. I made this cake for them and it got rave reviews! My husband, father, &amp; sons have all requested (demanded, really!) that I make it for Thanksgiving, if not sooner. This recipe is a keeper!!!"
23119,166865,9/23/2009,5,Wonderful fish!!!!!!!!!!!Will be making these again. Easy and tasty. Made for PAC.
1623265,166865,3/28/2014,3,This was good but for some reason my breading fell off while frying it.
156034,179951,7/3/2007,4,"Tried this for ZWT III and it was very good.

It is much better warm, but DH did take the rest of it to work with him the next day and the guys really enjoyed it.

Thanks Chilicat....it is a good, quick recipe to make and we liked it."
220166,179951,7/8/2007,4,I am not big on sweet cornbread but this was good.  I have never made cornbread with bisquick and I was kinda leary but it turned out really good.  I liked the texture it had.  It isn't a cornbread I would serve with beans but I will make it again.  Thanks chilicat!
41578,180387,7/20/2009,5,"What a perfect way to start the day.  The eggs turned out light and fluffy.  I served this with a bowl of fresh fruit.  This would also be a great dish to serve to guests.  Thanks for sharing, Bobbie #3!!!"
381180,180387,5/3/2010,5,"GREAT QUICHE!  I had it for breakfast this morning and it reheated quickly in the microwave for dinner tonight!  I used 1/4 tsp red pepper because I was totally out of black pepper ~ I had only 1/4 cup mozzarella, so I added 4-ounces of minced Swiss and also added 1 T dried chives.  Made for Andi's MAY FARM COOKING in the Photo forum."
1967997,180387,12/24/2011,5,"My family didn't care too awfully much for it, but I didn't mind, because this was beautiful and smelled amazing!!  I don't eat the main ingredients in this due to stomach problems, but if I had, I KNOW it would have been 100% perfect!  So, bravoooooo on an amazing and easy (wow-don't get that combo often!) meal!  Served with mini blueberry waffles from my new waffle iron.<br/><br/>And K-U-W, beautiful picture!!!"
2437861,180387,10/8/2012,0,"made this for Brunch--added green peppers . It turned out beautifully and was very good.Going to add mushrooms,sausage and onion next time. Hubby really liked it. Thanks for sharing."
353789,180387,6/3/2018,5,"Not only is this the easiest quiche; it's crowd-pleasing delicious. I slice the pie and freeze it. It's way better than a bowl of cereal weekday mornings. Because I typically buy x-large eggs, I use 3 eggs in this recipe. I also vary the cheeses. This is such a versatile recipe...I love it!"
268973,200673,1/15/2007,5,"Wow, this is so yummy! It was really quick too.  I was a little scared of the red peppers, but all it did was add a little zip. This was absolutely fantastic. Thank you so much!"
187281,200673,1/19/2007,5,Easy and sooo yummy! A great alternative to pizza!
562341,200673,9/13/2007,5,"Quick and satisfying is right.  I loved this meal.  I added sliced mushrooms to mine as well.  It is really a blank slate in which you could add anything you wanted.  My husband and I were coming up with different ways to reinvent this recipe.  How about a chedder, turkey and bacon one.  Absolutely delicioius."
552807,200673,11/2/2007,5,Great quick & simple recipe!  Thanks!
360127,200673,12/8/2007,4,"Excellent. We have never had stromboli before, but it was great! The kids ate theirs all up without me harassing them (a rarity in our house). I am making it again this week. I couldn't find pre made pizza dough, so used #151791."
710496,200673,1/9/2008,5,"This was fantastic and easy to make.  The roasted red peppers gave the stromboli a nice flavor.  Next time, I think I might put some mushrooms inside, or perhaps some sauteed onions.  The possibilities are endless!"
719929,200673,2/1/2008,4,"DH loved it! That's saying a lot. Thank you for the recipe, will definitely use again sometime."
230860,200673,3/4/2008,5,"This was fantastic!  So simple and a nice full flavor.  Maybe a touch too greasy from the pepperoni, but I just let it drip out and dabbed w/ paper towel to soak some up.  I also had to use regular pepperoni since that's all I could find.  Definately a keeper and probably quite versatile as well."
189475,200673,12/8/2008,5,"This was SO good!  I messed up the first one by rolling the pizza dough in a ball and it wouldn't spread out into a pizza crust, but my friend used the messed up dough to make garlic knots and I learned an important lesson about how NOT to make a stromboli! Fortunately I had another thing of pizza dough and I used that one to make a very delicious stromboli. Thanks for the recipe."
646398,200673,1/7/2009,5,"An awesome family friendly recipe!  After their first bite, my husband and 2 kids immediately requested this to be put into the regular dinner rotation.

Thanks for posting."
358544,200673,2/16/2009,5,Very simple an delicious! Family enjoyed this a lot. Will be making again and maybe trying salami and ground sausage. Thank you.
1141377,200673,1/25/2010,3,"I thought this was going be a ""go to"" meal, but it was extremely doughy.  My husband and I were so disappointed this didn't turn out.  Hopefully others have better luck.  Thanks for posting."
972900,200673,3/15/2010,5,"We have made this 3 times in the last month - my husband raves about it! Today I made it in advance and put it in the fridge until dinner. My husband likes to slice pieces off of it and pan sear them - extra amazing! We put prosciutto, ham, salami, pepperoni, provolone cheese and mushrooms in ours. Very impressive and easy dinner - takes about 10 minutes to throw together!"
1034569,200673,2/7/2011,5,This is so easy to make. I throw it together a lot for a quick lunch and heat up the leftovers during the week. In one of the reviews someone mentioned pan searing it and I found that to be an easy way to heat it up. You can do so much with this recipe.
290010,200673,4/20/2013,4,"I made this as written except I omitted the peppers.  I liked it, but it is a bit salty for me."

207176,231028,5/30/2007,0,My kids love carrot sticks with Ranch dressing as long as I don't give it too often!  I buy the bags of mini carrots already prepared so it's easy to throw them into a snack size ziplock bag.
64667,231028,6/4/2007,4,"You know, I've packed carrot sticks in the kids' & hubby's lunches for years, just NEVER once thought to put in some DIP for 'em (not more than a few times, that is).

653438,326843,3/19/2011,4,Made this for Spring PAC 2011 and it does have a kick.  Next time I might cut down on the red peppers but still overall it  was quite good.  I seasoned some shrimp that I had with the seasoning and grilled them for an appetizer.
2342357,326843,7/26/2012,0,I like this season salt it help create many dishes
962690,348112,7/17/2009,5,"The pastry for this is WONDERFUL.
I cut it in a 10 inch circle then made a smaller one.

Next time I will slice my apples a bit thinner so I can get more apple in. I was having a hard time folding the pasty over and having it tear only because my slices were a bit to thick.I didn't use all the toffee bits but should of so will next time LOL.
This was the perfect size to give us apple pie without alot of pie leftover.
Served with vanilla ice cream drizzled with caramel sauce.
PERFECT.
This is going in my Divine Cookbook.

Made for Everyday is a Holiday"
444132,348112,8/16/2009,5,"Beautiful AND delicious!  I like that this is like a half sized pie, perfect for smaller families, like mine.  I used two apples, which I sliced thin, as wicked suggested - and I did use all the toffee chips, and I'm glad I did!  I suggest putting the apples on less than half of the circle, as you'll need a little more than half when you fold it over.  I think I will push the apples a little closer to the edges than I did (well, at least on the ends), because my ends were a little long - this is one recipe that will definately improve as I get better at working with pastry.  Thanks, WC, for a great recipe!  Made for PRMR Tag."
424680,348112,5/16/2010,5,"What a great way to make just half a pie, especially when using fruit that doesn't end up with a lot of juice! Made this very tasty pie for just 2 of us, giving us a wonderful dessert & a bonus snack later on, but without a whole pie to finish off! My other half particularly enjoyed the inclusion of the toffee pieces! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Tagged & made in Please Review My Recipe]"

526666,348112,12/2/2010,5,"OK, so I *cheated* a little, as I had a pie crust I needed to use. I'm certainly going to make this again and look forward to making the pastry from scratch, as this will certainly get even better! The toffee bits are very complimentary. It was easy to make, tho, perhaps due to my crust, I only needed 30 minutes, and maybe a couple less next time. I also used turbinado sugar for sprinkling on top. Just wonderful and super easy; great as a last minute dessert for the family. I did serve mine a la mode. Yum! Thanks for sharing, weekend cooker!"
50509,348112,10/27/2011,4,"I also used a premade crust. Because it came in a roll, it was easy to cut in half and make two smaller pies, which was more practical for me. I misread the amount of toffee bits, so this was not sweet enough for me - even though my apple was a tart-sweet variety. The one thing that I did not like was that there was a bit too much crust on the edges - that might have been to my admittedly inept technique with pie crust. This is a great idea for a smaller pie for smaller households."
286566,352182,2/16/2011,4,"We really liked the marinade but next time I would use fresh oregano and also add some fresh rosemary (we are fortunate that both grow abuntantly all year round and I did double the garlic as we just love the fresh garlic we have harvested).  I cooked on an indoor grill (using 12 loin chops for 4 which were served up with 2 recieving 4 and the other 2 persons got 2 each which suited us).  I cooked on an indoor electric ridged grill 5 minutes per side which gave a well done to the smaller chops and a slight pink to the larger ones so everyone got what they liked.  Thank you Sara 76, made for Bargain Basement."
1840822,446948,2/27/2011,0,NOT an oreo lots of time to make and very disappointing
141980,15140,5/6/2005,4,"Very simple and quick meal to throw together at the end of the day. Perfect for working moms and dads! We used low-fat rolls to lighten the recipe just a bit and it still tasted good. Next time, I would probably add some diced onion to give it a little more flavor. Thanks Branwyn!"
304590,28794,8/28/2006,5,"This cheesecake is so light and fluffy! And unlike most recipes out there it only uses 2 packages of cream cheese!! I have made it without the pineapple and it is awesome too. I have also cut the recipe in half (except 3 eggs instead of 5) and prepare it in an 8in springform and it comes out great as well. I use the wide side foil to make sure that no water will leak in...sometimes if you have to overlap foil to cover the whole bottom, the water will still find a way in. I messed up one of these cheesecakes that way unfortunately. Try it today!!"
875616,28794,7/28/2009,5,fanstatically light and delicious!
176615,67055,3/2/2009,4,"Simple skillet meal that's good when the weather is cold. Creamy sauce covers chicken pices and hunks of potato and carrots. I used ""pick o the chick,"" which was more than 4 pounds of chicken, 5 medium potatoes, and a pound of baby carrots. Even so, there was plenty of sauce. For my tastes, I would reduce the fat next time, subbing half and half for whipping cream and reducing the butter at least by half. With butter, whipping cream, and fat from the chicken skin, I was feeling a bit guilty. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
205786,28794,3/3/2010,5,"Awesome. I did make some changes but the basics were the same and I loved the results. I wanted to make half the recipe, and did so, with the following exceptions. I used 3 egg yolks and 2 whites. I omitted the pineapple and juice, instead using the juice of one lemon. I made this in a 6"" springform pan which I buttered generously and sprinkled with graham crumbs (it took about 1/4 cup to coat the pan bottom and sides). I was worried that the pan was going to be too small but it worked perfectly. I wrapped the bottom of the pan in foil and set it in a larger pan with water about 3/4"" up the sides of the pan. I cooked it a 325ÂºF (my oven runs a little hot) and it took 70 minutes. This made 6 nice-size servings which I served with a strawberry sauce."
93843,43572,7/13/2003,4,"The taste is nice, definitely like tomatoey stroganoff.  I think it probably tastes better the next day after it has had time to firm up a bit more."
125325,43572,1/21/2006,4,This was really good and filling. My family really enjoyed this. The only change I made was to use minced garlic instead of garlic salt. Thank you!
143086,43572,1/1/2007,5,"So glad I took a chance and requested this recipe on here...Just sorry it took me so long to post a review.  I made this within a week of getting the email, and it tasted even better than I remembered.   Miss Annie, thanks again so much for posting this."
545825,43572,8/23/2007,5,"I've been making this lasagna for years.  It's definitely one of our favorites.  It is very filling, but makes enough for my husband to be able to take a slice with him for lunch the next day."
53373,43572,9/26/2007,5,"My new ""standby"" lasagna recipe!  My family raves over it.  I sub low fat items and use turkey ground beef and turkey sausage and whole wheat noodles.  Soooo yummy!!
I add a little italian seasoning to the meat sauce and some parm chz during the laying process!!"
177933,43572,10/19/2007,4,"I thought it was great, my husband thought it was too cream cheesy.  I made it for a friend that just had a baby, I am sure they enjoyed it.  Thanks!"
53932,43572,2/17/2009,5,This is very good.  I deviated from the recipe a bit using my own meat sauce.  Loved the cream cheese/sour cream filling as a delightful change from ricotta!
623399,43572,9/16/2009,5,"I first made this recipe out of my taste of home contest winning book.  It is DELICIOUS! I have made it several times and whenever I am in the mood for lasagna, this is the recipe that I go for.  I love the cream cheese mixture in this!  It makes it so creamy and unique.  LOVE IT!  I do normally season the sauce mixture real well with more spices and seasonings.  But other than that I stick to the recipe!  The best lasagna ever!  10 stars!!"
89831,53518,7/12/2004,5,"Uncle Bill, I made your perogies over the weekend, and they were so good, I am giving your recipe more than 5 stars... actually I must say, the best dough that I have made so far, and I have tryed a lot of different pierogi dough recipes! I did not have a pierogi mini form, so I rolled out the dough by hand. I made the dough the night before, and used it the following day, I took it out of the fridge and let it sit on the counter at room temperature, that made for easier rolling. You didn't state where to add in the sour cream, so I just added it with the whipping cream, milk and eggs, I did however, used half and half instread of milk. I used my own filling recipe with fryed onions, sour cream and Cheeze Whiz...I am so happy that I decided to try your recipe they turned our absolutely wonderful. Although, it took me a half a day to make these, it was well worth the time and effort. Thanks so much for sharing such a winning recipe Uncle Bill. I look forward to making these again (the next time I will make them with saurkraut!).. , this method produces a wonderful soft dough, I highy advise anyone to try your recipe, thanks...Kittencal:)"
138429,53518,11/15/2004,5,"What can I say . This deserves 10 out of 5. I always had a lady make up Perogies for me but after seeing the great detailed instructions, decided to try this recipe. I will make my own perogies from here on in. I followed the recipe and will never change a thing. Thank you so much for the recipe and detailed instructions. "
199839,53518,6/14/2007,3,Great!!
806741,53518,10/26/2008,5,Fantastic. I made the recipe as prescribed. I had made a Thai butternut squash soup and beef stew with mashed potatoes the day before. I used both of these for filling (of course not together) they turned out amazing. I froze them. The real test will be when my Lithuanian friend is over for dinner. I will try to report back on her opinion!
713867,53518,5/4/2010,5,"Uncle Bill, your recipes are amazing!  I made perogies using your dough (instead of my Mennonite grandmother's) and the cottage cheese filling we've always used (just like yours).  Sooooooooo good!  We've always served our ""cheesepockets"" with sour cream and onions fried in lots of butter.  My niece and nephew have been known to eat them to the point of groans and immobility!  Thanks again for all your wonderful recipes."
1445414,53518,6/16/2010,3,"I have been making perogies since I could walk. My mom had me in the kitchen rolling dough and mashing potatoes. This is the nicest dough I have worked with in those many years. The dough is best worked if left to sit for an hour or so after making. My friends and family get together at least once a year to make anywhere from 500 to 2000 perogies and then freeze them. They freeze remarkably well. I am however, only giving the dough 3 stars because it is quite high in fat and once you add all the fixings the meal becomes a quadruple bypass waiting to happen. next time I think I am going to try the recipe with a few substitutions i.e the milk, cream and sour cream and see how it goes."
524381,133224,1/18/2008,5,"This was so delicious!  Very easy and very flavorful!  Really a refreshing change from the baked turkey I normally do!  I don't know if it was a scale issue (I scaled up 3X), but there was a considerable amount of excess broth at the end.  I just turned up the heat and boiled it off and it was fine.  And it was so pretty with the white rice, red tomatos and green spinach; I would serve this for company!  Thank you, Bec!!"
221810,133224,10/20/2008,5,"Very Yummy! I used half a pound of ground turkey, brown rice, and frozen spinach. I ended up having to double the broth because of the brown rice, and I didn't have any tomatoes, so I just threw in diced fresh mushrooms instead. Being diabetic, it was perfect for me. I know it says ""for  2"" but I'm gonna end up scarfing it all myself! Thanks for the yummy, healthy lunch, Bec!"
440324,133224,11/19/2011,5,"Delicious! I used brown rice and arugula instead of spinach. It looked very appetizing and the tasted even better. To me, this is the ultimate weeknight meal. Thank you."
583809,133224,2/14/2015,5,"An easy and nutritious meal!  I used ground turkey, frozen spinach, and spaghetti sauce.  Fabulous one dish supper."
220348,158419,4/14/2012,5,"This was so delicious! First of all, I used a combination of dried apricots, dates, raisins and dried cranberries for the dried fruits. For the macaroons, I used chocolate because I love chocolate, and I've always found that apricots and raisins go well with chocolate, and in this case, it's also true. The cinnamon and cloves just add to the sweetness of the macaroon compote, which is just fine with me! Sadly, though, I cannot tell you if this refrigerates well overnight, because it never lasted that long, which is fine, because I plan to make more! :)"
131126,159265,6/20/2006,5,"I liked this one and thought the curry powder worked well on butternut squash.  I used Femmes' Revenge Caribbean Curry Mix Recipe #158082 I also didn't bother with threading on skewers.  I served right out of the oven.  Thanks Sharon!!! 
"
67656,159265,6/24/2006,4,"These were quite good. I replaced the butter with olive oil (same fat but less cholesterol), and reduced it to about 2 tablespoons. Also added a bit  (1/2 teaspoon maybe) of garam masala. Really liked the way the spices contrasted with the natural sweetness of the squash. These would be a great way to get some veggies on the menu at a party dominated by finger foods. I think next time I might include sweet onions and red peppers to add a little more dimension and color to the dish. Thanks Sharon."
211184,159265,6/26/2006,5,I really liked this. The curry/butter sauce was just right with the squash. Thanks for posting. Nick's Mom
112818,159320,2/9/2007,0,"I did not like the taste of this recipe. I feel that it is lacking other ingredients. I would omit the chili sauce and replace it with ketchup, and the dill pickles would have to go. Of course, omitting those two ingredients makes it a completely different recipe with other ingredients."
171063,200881,12/29/2006,5,"I made this one night after dinner for my family, and it has a refreshingly fruity taste and was easy to make.  Thanks for this fun recipe."
336058,202788,2/3/2007,4,"I used all w.w. pastry flour, margarine, and frozen blueberries.  I never have good luck with my waffle maker!  The first few came out great, but then they started falling apart when I took them out.  I think I'll make them as pancakes.  I put butter and cinnamon/sugar on them and I couldn't taste the blueberries.  Might have been the all w.w. and frozen berries.  Next time will try with fresh (if I can afford organic).  Will try the orange zest next time (didn't have organic orange.)"
64642,202788,6/11/2008,5,"These were just wonderful and so easy to make.  Followed the recipe as written and had no problems with it at all.  To stop the waffles from sticking, I give the waffle iron a little spritz of cooking spray between waffles."
279989,202788,8/25/2008,4,These were a really good meal.  I fixed them for our family for brunch over the weekend.  I used frozen blueberries and omitted the pecans and orange zest because we didn't have any but I'm sure these are wonderful with them.  This was our first experience at using wheat flour in our waffles and we all agreed they were wonderful with it.  I had no trouble with them sticking to my waffle iron or falling apart.  Thanks for sharing.
128473,202788,4/8/2010,5,"Now these were some good waffles.  Really flavorful with great texture.  These big tall treats were crisp on the outside and tender inside, just bursting with flavor. I love the addition of the orange zest to the pancakes.  I made these exactly as written and didn't have any problems.  Thanks so much Calee for sharing this tasty treat.  Made for my Pac baby. :)"
2000151138,115119,4/19/2015,5,These are amazing!
705251,202788,6/28/2012,5,This is an excellent recipe for blueberry waffles.  I was looking for a recipe that included whole wheat and you've hit the mark with this gem.  The waffles had a great texture to them and packed full of flavor.  I think the next time I may exclude the nuts and add some cinnamon and/or nutmeg for a little twist.  I doubled the recipe so I could have some frozen for future breakfasts.  Thanks for sharing!
2000206708,202788,5/16/2015,5,"I doubled the blueberries, added a micro splash of almond extract, and subbed ev coconut oil for the butter.  They&#039;re fabulous!!   I remembered the egg white trick.  My brother taught me that a long time ago.  It makes them special somehow, more crisp."
270370,236801,1/20/2009,5,"My Italian stepfather used to make these and i have been dying to figure out how to do them since he is gone now.  Wow, yummy, and so much thanks for the recipe:)"
481092,239952,11/9/2007,5,"This was a nice change of pace from Italian sausage and tomato sauce.  I wasn't sure what a ""sun blushed tomato"" was so I used three roma tomatoes diced.    I liked it more than my husband, but since I'm the poster, hee hee, I gladly give this five stars."
930100,239952,9/5/2008,4,This was really good but a little too spicy for me. When I make this again I think I might try leaving out the red pepper flakes.
601528,239952,10/1/2008,4,Wooo is this spicy! I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used a can of drained diced tomatoes and that worked out just fine. Very good and we will be making it again.
58104,239952,2/23/2009,5,"This is rich, deep and delish. I sliced sweet onions thinly in half circles. Roasted garlic is a must! For the tomatoes I used Recipe #57884. 
Thanks!!!"
1197511,239952,7/24/2009,5,"I made this dish a few days ago. I followed the recipe almost exactly (maybe added a little extra garlic - I tend to). My girlfriend and I loved this dish, and I'm making it again tonight for some friends. I used grocery-shelf ingredients (red cooking wine, sausage, sun-blushed tomatoes from a jar, etc.), and it turned out wonderfully. Very highly recommended!"
1639045,239952,6/22/2010,4,I loved this recipe... was very tasteful. i removed the casings from the sausage though and pan fried it with onions some garlic and chili pepper flakes!! Was awesome even my 7 year old daughter loved it.
411045,239952,11/5/2010,0,"I am not going to rate this, since I had to make quite a few changes, but what I did was delicious.  First of all I used the ground chorizo, since it was what I had.  I did not have garlic cloves, so I used garlic powder.  I used a can of undrained diced tomatoes and in place of the red wine, I used beef broth.  It was very good having made these changes, even my 2 yo really liked it.  I will make it again.  Maybe I will be able to make it the way it is written!"
1427444,239952,11/25/2010,4,"This turned out sooo good! made a few changes though,used 2 400g tins diced Italian tomatos, 4 chirizos and 5 cloves garic(love the stuff) also used 500g of penne pasta as i made it for 5 people.will definately make this again ,thanks for a lovely recipe :)"
1877783,239952,4/8/2011,0,Sticking to this recipe brings out the best result. Have cooked variations in the past using just a few ingrediants however the addition of red wine adds another layer to this dish. The fragrant Chorizo if bought from a good deli will really be the boss on the plate. Sensational.
437727,239952,3/2/2012,5,"This is 100% KICK BUTT AWESOME!! I was debating between this and another recipe, chose this one.... and SO glad I did! Unfortunately, I didn't have any sun-blushed tomatoes, so I used some home oven-dried ones that I reconstituted in the microwave. Added the tomato water with the tomatoes. EXCELLENT!!... (and don't skip the step of roasting the garlic, it adds so much dimension to this dish!!"
2574795,239952,12/4/2016,4,"Didn't have sun-blushed tomatoes so used canned diced (long way to town for us). Otherwise followed closely. I liked the spice but it was a bit much for my wife. If we make again, I will probably leave out the dried chili pepper flakes and let each person add their own."
421546,281867,2/29/2008,5,"This is a delicious and decadent pudding.  The straining and blending make it lusciously smooth and creamy, something I probably should have been doing to all my puddings over the years.  This is just the ticket to satisfying my chocoholic husband.  Thank you for posting!"
59879,283684,2/24/2012,4,A really great weeknight dinner that is quick and tasty!  Have made several times and didn't realize that it was on here so I could rate.
53932,299611,7/25/2009,4,So simple to prepare and very good.
46196475,460085,4/25/2015,5,"Excellent recipe. Didn&#039;t change a thing.
A perfect French bread."
1060485,343892,4/28/2009,2,very bland.
247152,310201,5/27/2009,5,"This was even better than expected, especially since I had to do a change of plans at the last second. I was just starting to make this when I realized that I was out of long-grain white rice so I ended up using minute rice and following the microwave instructions (I know, gasp!)... but it honestly turned out really nice! In fact I would make this again as an easy Mexican side dish. I left out the Cajun seasoning and served this with chicken and cheese enchiladas tonight. Thanks for a great recipe! I think I'll probably make this again exactly the same or even in my rice cooker once I re-stock my rice supply :) Made for ZWT5."
323186,310201,6/5/2009,5,"Easy to prepare,  I made this quickly last night to accompany a light chicken curry, we enjoyed it very much, good flavour and a good texture.  I omitted the cajun seasoning this time, but will try adding it next time, depending on what I'm serving it with, I'm sure it'll be delicious!

Good recipe, thank you Vicki!

Made for ZWT5"
331557,310201,8/5/2009,5,"This rice is great and especially great for a change from white.  I followed the recipe as written the first time and it turned out great.  The second time I used the rice cooker - just threw all ingredients in the pot at the same time and let it go.  It was still tasty, although, oddly enough, spicier.  Thanks for posting a keeper!"
764068,310201,9/10/2009,5,Awesome rice! The smokiness of the cumin is wonderful. The only thing I changed was that I made it in the rice cooker instead as CYAOS mentioned. Could not have been easier to make and it was done in no time. Thank you for posting Vicki!!!
213139,310201,4/19/2010,4,"This was good, but we didn't feel that it was very spicy and the lime flavor could have been a little stronger.  Will definitely make this again and adjust the spices and lime juice to our likings.  Made for Spring 2010 PAC."
226145,310201,5/9/2011,5,Loved it!  Made with the cajun seasoning and it wasn't too spicy.  Will be a favorite from now on.  Thanks for posting PianoCook!
1404497,372992,10/4/2009,4,The London Broil was so tender it was falling apart.  The potatoes and carrots stayed firm.  Delicious!
1398656,372992,12/26/2013,5,"Great easy way to cook London Broil. Very tender and tasty. I make my own onion soup mix, (the recipe is here on Food.com), to reduce the salt."
1803152032,372992,9/20/2014,0,How do u make your own soup mix???
2000211886,372992,5/19/2015,1,"What a WASTE of good ingredients. I should have known from the lack of seasonings that the meat would be tasteless, but it was also completely dried out - something I never thought could happen when cooking in that much liquid. One of the WORST crock pot dishes I&#039;ve ever had and definitely the worst London Broil I&#039;ve ever made. I&#039;ll stick to grilling it from now on."
1667251,372992,1/22/2016,2,I should have realised that the lack of additional seasonings would make this bland.  The house did not smell like anything was cooking.  A waste of an expensive piece of meat.
2001081653,372992,7/9/2016,4,"I found this to be a good recipe. And I must point out to some novices that slammed this recipe: unless the recipe is for a bakery item, it gives you the basics. The blank foundation and leaves the seasoning up to. So, if you make this, you add the type and quantity of seasonings you want. Play with the recipe such as browning the near and using some red wine as part of the liquids. Add a splash of steak sauce or a dash of Italian seasoning with salt and pepper. Use baby red potatoes or try parsnips or yucca. It's up to you."
131349,387741,12/16/2009,4,"I used the dipping sauce and it is delicious, I used dry onion soup that you can buy in packages, 1/4 cup mayo vs the 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup ranch dressing. The mayo or dressing can be a little over powering so add carefully. This is a great recipe. thanks
Chris"
136997,408272,1/19/2010,5,"Delicious. I didn't have the Fusilli on hand, so used Ziti. I added the suggested Parmesan and lemon zest. Made for New Kids on the Block Tag. :)"
47892,408272,2/10/2010,4,Easy yet elegant dish. I accidentally purchased penne and not fusilli but at least it was the correct pasta shape for this recipe. (Confused myself looking at Lori Mama's photo.) I felt the dish were missing something and I added a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg to the cream sauce. A light sprinkle of Greek myzithra and the lemon zest  on top made for a very delicious and quick meal. Reviewed for Veg Swap #19-2010. Thanks!
424680,411350,3/8/2010,5,"Made these GREAT TASTING BARS to take to an art class & share with the students, & to make them a little less overpowering with calories, I cut the finished pan into 16 smaller bars (15 students & the instructor, so . . .)! Very warmly received & acclaimed ~ Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Made & reviewed in New Kids on the Block tag]"
1633475,427939,6/14/2010,5,"This is absolutely fantastic.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, and it was the most flavorful, tender chicken ever.  The gravy was a huge hit with the family.  We love spicy food, but if you don't you can use less chipotle.  I can't wait to make this again!"
178427,458421,10/11/2011,5,This is fabulous! I made it as directed. It was made for a birthday party and everyone just loved it. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing. Made for PAC Fall 2011.
2001002847,460085,1/2/2017,5,"I love this recipe but usually find that the first phase has some trouble with the flour:water ratio (usually ends up being too sticky, even for French bread). Can someone please post ingredient weights? I always prefer to weigh vs scoop, so would greatly appreciate any insight. Thanks."
2001805186,460085,11/19/2017,5,"Awesome!!! It took longer then I planned, however not bad for my first time making any bread. Can’t wait to make pizza subs with it. If I only had made my homemade wine prior. Delicious bread!!! Thank you for this recipe."
2001935821,460085,1/16/2018,5,"I use the bread machine for French bread, then turn off the machine before the last rise. I use the mixing order (put salt in last)and shaping methods by Danielle Foresterie. Look like the real McCoy and taste delicious."
384918,472331,3/29/2013,5,"Actually I forgot to add the oil, so the mixture seemed pretty dry.  I added an egg (instead of re-reading the recipe, duh) and they turned out pretty yummy!  I gave it 5 stars because they are yummy even when I goofed up.  Next time I will try with the oil  :)"
1802793382,472331,6/3/2014,5,This was a very easy recipe to follow and surprisingly tastey!
2001977923,472331,2/6/2018,5,"Turned out great. I added a tablespoon of sugarless chocolate. I used coconut oil since it was all that I had. Added 3/4 cup dried sugarless cranberries and 1/4 cup dried cherries. It was fine with only two medium bananas. Because the fruit had such little sugar in it, I added 2 tablespoons of sugar."
2002138361,472331,5/2/2018,5,"I don't normally make comments but these cookies turned out really well and the ingredients were not overly complicated or expensive. I made a few tweaks because I was out of vegetable oil so instead I used vegan becel, and added 3 heaping tablespoons of brown sugar, and doubled the amount of cinnamon. I forgot to let the mixture sit for 15 minutes prior to baking, but when I made a second batch (because they are so good) I didnt notice a difference between the cookies, so if you are in a hurry or you forget its nbd."
226863,495322,3/1/2013,4,"This recipe makes a lot of sauce to go with the meat.  I really wanted mashed potatoes so served this over mashed potatoes instead of over the rice.  This turned out a bit sweet, so I think I'd half the amount of Pepsi and ketchup next time.  I'll also simmer a bit longer to allow the meat to get a bit more tender.  Overall, this tasted very good.  Thanks for posting, and good luck in the contest!"
131126,495322,3/2/2013,5,"I adapted the recipe to fit my day. The steak was breaded and fried early in the day and then set aside. Later that evening, the steak was placed in a foil lined pan sauce,  veggies were added, and the recipe baked uncovered for 50 minutes on 350 oven.  We found the steak was still fairly tough and it would have benefited for a longer cook time.  There was still loads of sauce and the recipe had enough onions and peppers.  The sauce thickened, has notes of celery seed, and a nice hint of tart from the ponzu. The meal was served with mixed colors of fingerling potatoes, garlic bread, and a green salad.  I wish I had followed the instructions though & stuck with the suggested rice.  I saved the leftover sauce to serve over potatoes later in the week.  <br/>Next time? I would use tenderized round for frying & increase the baking time.  Good luck in the contest!"
128473,502734,7/15/2013,5,"I really enjoyed the eggs prepared this way morgainegeiser.  It was quick and really easy with fantastic results.  The eggs were perfectly cooked and had a wonderful texture and flavor.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, it made for a delicious breakfast.  Made for ZWT9."
328048,502734,7/17/2013,0,Easy and delicious. I cooked my eggs 20 minutes to get them cooked through. Great flavor. The feta adds a nice touch.
1226388,502734,7/18/2013,5,"This was really great!  It was delicious, and fast and easy enough to be a quick weekday breakfast, and luxurious enough for a lazy weekend.  It was really tasty just as it was posted, and I would like to try it next time with some additions like sauteed veggies, or even some bacon.  Made for ZWT9"
199105,62125,10/8/2006,5,I've made this several times and it never fails to impress!
133174,502734,7/19/2013,5,Made this for DH&#039;s breakfast this morning.  The butter was placed in the ramekin which was put into the oven while it preheated.  After butter melted the eggs were broken and placed into the ramekin then sprinkled with the feta.  Freshly ground black pepper was sprinkled over all.  The eggs required about an additional 4 minutes to cook to DH&#039;s liking.  This was served with butter toast.  Made for ZWT9.
383346,502734,7/23/2013,5,I baked them 12 minutes.  The white were cooked but the yolks were still runny.  It was great.  Thanks morgainegeiser :)  Made for ZWT 9
174096,502734,7/27/2013,5,"Yum, love this variation - the feta cheese really added a lot of great flavor.  I cooked about 12 minutes.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
286566,502734,8/12/2013,5,"Delicious though I did have an oops moment in that the timer did not go off so my eggs ended up cooked more than I would have liked but still the flavours were great.  Thank you morgaingeiser, made for Aussie/Kiwi Recipe Swap #79 August 2013."
480195,502734,8/27/2013,5,"This is a delicious way to serve eggs. My oven must run hot, because they were done in 10 minutes. I served them with sliced tomatoes, fresh from the garden. A wonderful breakfast. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
28818,11415,7/8/2003,5,These are also called \
200862,11415,4/17/2005,0,"As a South African, this is not the recipe I'd use again for my beloved morning rusks-and-sweet-tea. The baking powder is not enough for a good rise and the sugar used is too little -- rusks should have a definite sweetness for that early morning lift! I'd also use more butter next time. (Rusks are not a diet food -- enough sugar and butter are musts!) Otherwise, it's okay."
398101,11415,12/1/2006,5,"this rusk recipe is to die for delicious!! i am south african and  have been looking or a recipe this ggod for ages.
thank you!!"
776892,11415,2/27/2008,0,Recipe is not how I remember making rusks and it did not turn out how I remember. Too flat and not flavorful
1644688,11415,7/2/2010,5,"These rusks were lovely, after reading the other reviews I did make some changes, because I am a lazy cook, I used five cups of self raising flour instead of the flour and baking powder in the recipe. 1 1/4 cups brown sugar, 1 tsp salt and 500ml buttermilk, the rest was as is. All the other rusk recipes I have seen and used called for 250 to 500gr butter, so this was perfect for a low fat treat. I will be making another batch this weekend, Because it was very gooey, I will try pouring the mixture into a baking dish and then cut up before drying out. will let you know how it works. thank you."
2399072,11415,9/17/2012,5,"This recipe is just what I have been looking for.  It most closely matches the rusks we had in SA.  We had them mostly while on safari, but we also found them in the supermarkets (Super Spar) around SA.  I just made my first batch and they came out just as I remember them, hard as rocks with flavor, ready for dipping.  This is definitely a keeper. I love them."
2657556,11415,1/26/2013,0,I really liked this recipe because of the low sugar and butter content. They were crunchy and delicious and I will be making them again.
1803556002,11415,12/24/2014,5,"I grew up eating Ouma&#039;s Rusks, and these taste almost exactly the way I remember them.&lt;br/&gt;When I was making them, I mis-wrote the recipe down and used brown sugar instead of castor sugar, and they still came out beautifully.&lt;br/&gt;I definitely will be making these again for my South African mum."
196455,44360,2/18/2005,5,Wow!  I recently had a pistachio biscotti at a local coffee house and loved it.  I came to the zaar to find a recipe and thought that I'd start here.  No need to look further!  Clear Directions and a product that is superior to most other biscotti that I've had.  Pefect amount of pistachios and sugar...and the lemon zest really rounds it out.  Thanks!!
178077,44360,5/8/2005,5,"My first attempt and everyone loved it.  I dipped mine in melted chocolate on one side, once completely cooled.  
I also used 1/2 cup pistachios and 1/2 cup sliced almonds."
119621,44360,5/10/2005,5,Excellent outcome! Very crunchy.
262830,44360,1/23/2008,5,"Oh my goodness, this was an excellent recipe.  I couldn't find shelled pistachios so I bought ones in the shells and shelled them.  They worked just fine.  I took it to work and everybody drooled over it. Thanks for a great recipe."
766166,44360,2/15/2008,5,"This is a great recipe!  The biscotti turned out beautifully. I made 2 small logs instead of one big one so that I could get more cookies. I've been making them weekly and have enjoyed dunking them in my coffee, tea, and milk. Thanks for posting."
1012944,44360,11/3/2008,0,"This is beyond excellent.  I didn't have a ""log""pan so I tried a loaf pan...big mistake.  I took it out, then kind of re-shaped it and cooked it again on a cookie sheet.  Baking times were a lot longer and I think might be longer than recipe states anyway.  However, finished product was so worth it.  I used raw pistachios, unsalted and unroasted.  Seriously a 5 star recipe."
866668,44360,11/9/2008,5,"These biscotti are great!  I've made them a few times, replacing the butter with more oil and the zest with a little lemon extract.   I prefer making two logs for smaller cookies, rolling them out with more flour to make them easier to handle."
37449,44360,12/28/2008,5,"5 stars for taste! I made these as a gift for my DIL, who loves biscotti. I had a challenge forming them and added more flour. They didn't look so great, but tasted wonderful. I added some craisins to make them more Christmasy! Thanks!"
1489711,44360,12/19/2009,5,This recipe was awesome! I did it just as said and it turned out great. Everyone loved it!
1991590,44360,5/11/2018,5,Awesome recipe. Made it vegan with egg replacer and coconut shortening. Squeezed a touch of fresh lemon over biscotti after final bake.
21443,139831,10/10/2005,5,These were to die for!!!  Even my husband who hates pumpkin liked them ( I didn't tell him what was in them until after he ate 3 of them!)  I used white and chocolate swirl chips instead of all chocolate...I also under baked them a bit to keep them soft and chewy...Thanks for this wonderful recipe...I will making it often!!
149420,139831,10/18/2005,5,These are the best cookies with pumpkin Ive ever tasted.. I made a mistake the first time and put in a whole can of pumpkin and they were still great.. Definitely a winner..
234666,139831,11/3/2005,5,Delicious!  This is my new favorite cookie.  They baked up light and fluffy with a hint of pumpkin.  I ommitted the nutmeg.  My 4-year-old daughter loved them too!
140806,139831,11/22/2005,5,Yum! Made these from a leftover can of pumpkin and couldn't be more pleased! Not to sweet. Great with semi-sweet chocolate chips. I added a little more flour than called for and next time I will use a little less nutmeg. Thanks!
151547,139831,4/2/2006,4,"Moist and fluffy with a cake-like texture, this cookie is a welcome change from the usual. "
212391,139831,11/1/2006,5,"holy CRAP!  these are soooooo good and even better than i expected.  even my husband, who was skeptical at the combo of pumpkin and chocolate, liked them.  i usually prefer crunchy, not soft cookies, but these were awesome.  only thing i did different was i used sucanat instead of sugar and about 3/4 t. nutmeg.  oh yeah, and more chocolate!!  thanks ellie!"
173314,139831,11/6/2006,5,Excellent and kids loved it and didnt even realize they got a healthy dose of vitamin a!  Thankyou...did halve the nutmeg and used milk chocolate chips.
652506,139831,11/18/2007,4,These cookies were great!  I even used real pumpkin from our garden.  I used two full cups of it (cooked and pureed) as oppose to one can from the store.  Very light and fluffy cookies.  I will definitely be making these again.
306106,139831,3/9/2008,4,"Only a 4 because they just aren't pretty cookies. They definitely are ADDICTIVE, though, and I am not usually one for sweets! I made the recipe exactly as directed (they ARE a bit sticky, can't imagine putting them through a press, although I don't have one...) and I did add the chips and nuts. YUM! Thanks so much, Ellie! :-)"
471896,139831,4/23/2008,4,"These are really good.  I made them for the DH's poker night and they vanished.  I did have to add 10 minutes to the baking time, so watch them closely.  The time will vary depending on your oven."
61796,139831,10/16/2008,4,"These are delicious cookies.  I had to add 6 minutes to the baking time.  They weren't quite as bright and pumpkiny as I was hoping, I'm trying to find something similar to cookies I got at a bakery in College.  Oddly enough, I thought they tasted much better when cold the next day."
74652,37158,11/2/2003,5,This is my favorite way to eat yellow squash too! A real southern classic. So easy and delicious! Thanks for sharing!  :)
1230562,139831,10/12/2010,0,"Yum! I made these for a church bake sale. They are easy to put together, and I always have these ingredients on hand. They are wonderful fresh from the oven, but they taste great once they've cooled too. I followed the recipe exactly (except I halved the nutmeg b/c I don't like it so strong) and did not use nuts or raisins. I used a 2 oz coffee scoop to form my cookies and they were perfectly cooked in 14 minutes. The only issue I have is that it doesnt taste as pumpkin-y as I'd hoped, so I'll probably add another 1/2 c of pumpkin next time and see if that flavor can come through a little more. Thanks for the recipe tho, I'm sure they'll be a big hit at the bake sale."
318262,139831,12/2/2010,5,Wow these were delicious! And the batter was really really good too - almost better than the cookies :) I used Libby's pumpkin pie mix so I didn't include the spices because it was already spiced. Worked out perfectly!
591035,139831,10/16/2011,4,"they are best fresh - even a half of a day later they loose any of that baked crunchy outside and become uniformly soft. but, when you have that in mind, they are delicious. i can taste the pumpkin. i might alter it to have more spices."
1384367,139831,2/2/2015,5,"These are super-delicious (and soft!) cookies. My kids ate so many of them. I didn&#039;t use chocolate chips, though -- just raisins. These will definitely be made again and again in this house."
227652,139831,3/19/2016,4,"I made these for a friend who loves pumpkin. After reading the reviews, I upped the pumpkin to 1 1/2 cups (made a very moist cookie), and used 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon &amp; nutmeg. I baked for 12 minutes but am thinking 11 min would have been better. And I didn&#039;t use raisins or nuts. Thanks for sharing!"
2000533648,139831,11/26/2016,5,These are very good cookies. I used white chocolate chips and the whole family loved them. It's a soft cookie with a light pumpkin taste. I threw out my old recipe and will be using this one from now on.
239808,160882,6/6/2006,5,"I really enjoyed this, but did increase the volume of garlic quite a bit (sorry to anyone sitting near me today...) I also added a bit of fresh oregano that needed using. I served ot with a rice dish, but next time I'll go for just crusty bread"
65197,160882,6/12/2006,5,"I love marinated mushrooms!  I've never made them with the tomato base before, these are great!
"
37449,160882,6/12/2006,5,"This tasted really good! I used less tomatoes, more mushrooms. Instead of tomato paste I used ketchup. I had rather large mushrooms so I sliced them, thickly. Loved it! Thanks Di!"
28729,160882,6/13/2006,5,"Great combination, mushrooms, tomatoes, wine and garlic. Yummy. Thanks for an awesome pasta dish"
107135,160882,7/10/2006,5,good stuff dee
297076,160882,9/15/2006,5,"These were simply amazing! Due to what we had, we used white wine and tomato sauce... didn't matter. I think I'll be hounding Tom to make these again and again. YUMMY!"
150281,160882,6/5/2007,5,"This was lovely! Made a great pasta dinner and something my family really enjoyed. A great menu option for my fresh summer tomatoes and I love mushrooms, so what could be nicer!
Added a little more garlic, other than that made as directed.
ZWT3"
278516,160882,9/18/2007,4,"Mmm mmm.
After it'd finished cooking i just put some couscous in the pan, put the lid on & let the juices soak in.
It was unattractive, but easy & tasty.
Served as a side.
I've made it before & I'll make it again. :)"
189280,160882,4/21/2008,5,"Excellent flavors! I will definitely be making these again. I actually used canned tomatoes, white wine and I used cinnamon sugar, since I usually add a pinch of sugar to tomatoes. I cooked the liquid out and served over couscous. I love it! Thanks for posting. Made for Herb/Spice of the Month."
80353,229525,5/28/2007,5,"Made this up as a snack for DH and myself today.  Spanish Bruschetta.  Loved the ease and the flavour - the presentation was very nice, too.  Good with some cold white wine."
527607,229525,10/2/2007,5,"Just superb. One of those recipes where the simplicity and freshness of the ingredients make a feast for the tastebuds.

Thank you so much for posting this FT.

Made for photo tag in the games forum"
41767,229525,2/27/2008,5,"Yum!  I served these at a Spanish-themed book club discussion last night along with sangria and a variety of other tapas.  They were a hit.  I couldn't find serrano ham, so I used prosciutto instead.  Thank you, French Tart, for such an easy and good recipe."
552613,229525,5/12/2009,5,"Gracias for treating me to such a natural and simple dish for my lunch today.  I used vine tomatoes , Spanish olive oil and Serrano ham to really make me feel like I was having my lunch in Spain instead of slightly chilly London. It tasted as fresh as it looked.  The only thing I might change next time is just to slice my baguette a bit thinner so I can get it more easily into my mouth without spilling any of those tasty tomatoes down my top.  Made for the Chow Hound team for ZWT5."
482933,229525,5/13/2009,5,Perfectly delicious plus easy!   Rainy here so our special lunch is helping us--disfrute del dia (enjoy the day).   Thank you FT for posting.  Made for Chow Hounds for ZWT5.
58104,229525,5/13/2009,5,"Delicioso! 
Didn`t have to change a thing! Served with Cabernet Sauvignon (Reserva), Penedes, Spain.
Perfecto!"
1446971,229525,11/16/2009,5,yummy. I was looking to recreate tapas from a recent trip to Barcelona...this was perfect!
871008,237164,7/24/2008,5,"I made this and it was excellent! The only changes I made were that I baked the eggplant on the cookie sheet for an additional 5-10 min., sliced the eggplant about 1/4-inch thick, and put it on top of angel hair pasta. Even my husband, who doesn't like eggplant, ate several servings!!! Yum!"
1055438,237164,12/11/2008,5,"I made this and it was yummy! My husband, who doesn't like eggplant, tried it and loved it too. I'll make this again!"
801865,237164,6/10/2009,5,My husband and I loved this!  I made the adjustments that Renae C. suggested and it turned out so good.  The only changes that I made was to use Barilla 5 cheese spaghetti sauce instead of the canned tomato sauce and used Mexican cheese (that's what I had on hand) and it still turned out great.
848136,237164,7/3/2009,4,My boyfriend and I loveed this recipe. I felt that it was a little dry so I added more sauce and cheese.
965414,237164,7/16/2009,5,This is my favorite WW recipe!!
1041886,237164,8/31/2009,5,"This makes a great sandwich on a 1 point ""Deli Flatbread"" that is available now! Yum!!!"
54678,237164,10/30/2009,4,I'm still learning to like eggplant... even grew a few in the garden this year and I'm trying WW. First bite was bitter but after that it was fine. My husband cut up the leftovers into rice I believe and it was great
666947,237164,12/9/2009,5,"<b>IMPORTANT:</b> To get the best texture and flavor, it's important to salt and sweat the eggplant before you bake it. It's easy. Just sprinkle slices with salt of choice and give them 20-30 mins to pull the moisture out. Once they're done, rinse and pat them dry. They are now ready to bread and bake! I didn't use Italian seasoning (don't like one of the spices in it), so I just mixed in some Basil, Oregano, and Thyme. You can use a smaller baking dish, you don't need a 9X13 if you're creating 3 layers. I served this on whole wheat angel hair and instead og canned tomato sauce, I used a jar of pasta sauce. I'll definitely make it again. The first time I made this recipe I didn't salt the eggplant and it was very tough. When I made it again with that change, it tasted like restaurant quality eggplant parmesan."
450571,237164,6/6/2010,5,Love it.  Super easy eggplant parm recipe that I can do on a weeknight.  Thanks for posting!
213407,237164,7/21/2010,5,"Made this yesterday and it was fantastic.  I cut my eggplant a little thick, but baked about 20 mins on each side and layered in 8 x 8 pan.  I also added a little extra tomato sauce and cheese.  I will definitely make this again."
1235658,237164,8/9/2011,5,This was  very easy to make and tasted fabulous.  The only change that I made was to use gluten free breadcrumbs.  This baked up very nicely.
243474,237164,11/25/2011,5,"Would never have guessed this is a healthy dish!  Followed danakscullyt64's advise and ""sweated"" the eggplant.  Sliced the eggplant before I realized I should have peeled it.  Didn't seem to hurt at all to leave the skin on. From Renae C.'s advise, I baked it on a cookie sheet for 15 minutes on each side. To finish baking with the sauce and cheese, I used a 7 x 11 glass dish and had just enough for two layers.  Excellent!"
41218,237164,7/19/2012,5,"Very tasty and will make this again!  I followed the recipe except for the suggestion of sweating the eggplant, used garlic italian bread crumbs, and Lidia's Chucky Eggplant Marinara.  I also had a few veggies I needed to use before spoiling, so while layering items, I added baby spinach leaves and mushrooms on top of each layer of eggplant (photo submitted).  I used exactly the amount of sauce and mozarella cheese as called for and my photo looks different than the other submission.  This recipe does NOT lack in flavor and it's healthy - can't beat that!"
1362457,237164,1/11/2013,3,I am giving this recipe 3 stars only because I think it technically worked and was edible but I found it very bland overall. I followed the recipe to the t but I did add the step of sweating the eggplant before breading it. I think this would be better with more added seasonings to the italian bread crumbs and a regular pasta sauce as opposed to the plain tomato sauce. The texture came out nicely so I may try it again with some more seasoning... I think I'd also incorportate zuchini slices to bulk up the recipe a bit.
1179225,237164,3/2/2015,4,"Loved it, except my eggplant was pretty tough, I even took the extra step of sweating it. Oh well, maybe it was my eggplant. I&#039;ll try cooking it a little longer next time and test a bite for tenderness. The flavors were wonderful. I think these would make a great sandwich filling. Thanks for sharing this very simple, delicious recipe."
1628373,237164,7/11/2016,5,"This recipe was spot on! The &quot;sweaty eggplant&quot; is the way to go and doesn't add much time to the cooking process if it is the first thing that you do. I added Parmesan cheese, Italaian Seasoning, salt, white pepper, black pepper, garlic salt (I'm out of garlic powder) and a dash of celery salt to the bread crumbs. Instead of using just bread crumbs, I mixed half Seasoned Panko crumbs and half Italian bread crumbs (what I had on hand). I have made this recipe a few times throughout the years, slightly tweaking each time. It comes out great every time!"
227652,237164,1/14/2017,5,"This was WONDERFUL! I made some changes but stuck to the recipe as best I could. I salted the eggplant as previous reviewers did to pull out the moisture. I switched the amounts of Parmesan cheese &amp; breadcrumbs (used whole wheat) &amp; added some oregano. I got 8 slices out of my eggplant so I was only able to do 2 layers. I didn't use egg whites; just nonstick cooking spray, used low fat mozzarella, and used spaghetti sauce (not regular tomato sauce). I think baking a little longer would get it heated through better; next time I'll bake for 15-20 min. Served over whole wheat spaghetti. Thanks so much for sharing!!"
2001341923,237164,2/19/2017,3,Cool. Jesus Loves You!!! :)
2002182126,237164,6/10/2018,5,"Outstanding. So good to have a great recipe while still losing weight. Missed sweating the eggplants but still went fine. I did use an oil spritzer and browned the breaded (used Panko) eggplant on a griddle. Added my &quot;bruschetta&quot; (tomatoes, basil &amp; red pepper flakes) home canned sauce, and a little garlic powder, cheese . layered in a 9 x 13 oven baking dish. Even my husband who doesn't ever want eggplant, ate this and like it. I had made it for just me since he was gone. He came home and had a snack. Will make it again many times. Placed it over 2 oz(dry) of cooked spaghetti which I spritzed with spray (fake) butter. Amazing, and so few points. Thanks Rhlannon."
1928828,247641,6/10/2011,0,Great site!
1802999449,247641,8/5/2014,5,Awesome quick dessert!! So Yummy!!
212497,264747,1/21/2011,5,"Wonderful! My kids inhaled this and they now put it on everything -- burgers, hot dogs, chicken nuggets. Anything! Thanks so much for posting!"
1926827,264747,6/7/2011,5,"I kept seeing this recipe turn up with every search, and eventually caved and tried it.  SO glad I did!!!  <br/><br/>I'm very finicky about sauces, I was relieved to notice almost *no* difference between this and the Micky Ds sauce.  I tried some of the Thousand Island variations, none of them were even close to this, Thanks for posting!"
1926889,264747,6/7/2011,5,"This is the same recipe I use, it's phenomenal!  I did a side-by-side comparison against the real deal, and it was impossible to tell which was which.  And it's good on so many things, fries, onion rings, sandwiches... the possibilities are endless.<br/><br/>The only thing I do differently is to microwave the sauce for 20 seconds after combining the ingredients.  This ensures that the sugar melts and it blends the flavors more effectively.  <br/><br/>Amazing recipe, thanks for posting!"
179133,264747,10/5/2011,5,"I don't eat McDonald's (it doesn't like me) so can't compare this to the ""real deal"" but don't care - it's good by me no matter how it compares! I did vary *slightly* from the recipe by using all mayo and all dill relish but I added a touch more sugar to make up the difference in sweetness. For the French dressing I used recipe #135295 since I had some made up already from a couple nights ago. Can't wait to try this on a burger or fries! Thanks for sharing!"
120121,264747,10/10/2011,5,"I don't do McDonald's, but I gave this to a friend who was searching for the real deal because, of all the wannabe recipes out there, this is the one that just sounded right to me.  She called just now to say that it was fabulous and her family just freaked out at how close it was to the original."
2164780,264747,1/29/2012,2,"It's not bad, but to me it was a bit bland and really didn't taste like the heavenly Big Mac sauce. I'm familiar with this recipe as it has been circulating around the web for several years and it supposedly came from a McDonalds restaurant's employee instruction booklet, but I honestly doubt it. I've personally found that Russian dressing (in particular, Ken's Russian Dressing) is the closest approximation to whatever McDonalds puts on their Big Macs, and definitely tastes better than this recipe."
2002084345,9054,3/30/2018,1,Mush
2000805503,264747,1/7/2016,5,"This is the recipe I found years ago. It is the one in the 1969 managers&#039; manual. So far, it is the closest to the real sauce.  I would like to add that I tried the one I saw in the video by the Canadian McD chef. The one with garlic powder, mustard, and praprika............that one is not even close. It is awful. It has an overpowering taste of garlic and mustard.........none of which are in the original. I really believe that was a fake video to make people give up and go buy a Big Mac."
1920860,317428,5/30/2011,5,Had this camping over the weekend.... EXCELLENT... everyone (even the kids) loved it!
37449,351968,7/5/2012,5,This made a great spread for toast. I enjoyed it. I did scale down the recipe for one. Thanks!
167242,390060,6/28/2011,5,"This was so, so good!  I was actually really surprised at how good something so simple could be.  I thought the potatoes would just be filler, but they're weirdly integral to the dish.  And with that creamy cheese and onion.... it's heaven.  Probably went a little heavy on the bacon and onion.  Served this with an arugula salad and some white wine for a dinner, and it was wonderful, easy, and totally satisfying.  Will definitely be making again!"
58104,402456,5/1/2010,5,"Spicy good!
I used chopped clams in place of the oysters. Added more shrimp to make up for the craw-fish I couldn`t get. Used fresh 1 1/2 teaspoons thyme, 1 1/2 teaspoons basil was used in place of the dry. Used a red onion an orange bell pepper. I did make shrimp stock along with home made chicken stock. Garlic was kicked up to 6 cloves. I used my pepper flakes in place of the cayenne which consists of very hot chilies. 
Delish and a must make."
204024,402456,7/21/2013,4,"Such an adventure to make.  Our crawfish were alive from the seafood market.  We bought a whole crab and cooked and cleaned out the meat.  This definitely expanded our cooking experiences.  That said next time we would leave out the oysters, we discovered we aren&#039;t  oyster lovers.  Good and Tasty Recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
211184,418486,3/22/2011,4,This was a hit with 3 hungry teenagers last night. I was able to fit 6 good sized enchiladas in a 9x13 baking dish. Really easy to make when time is short. I didn't use the optional rice and for the cheddar cheese soup I used Fiesta Nacho. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Made for PAC Spring 2011.
128473,511790,5/2/2014,4,"This was an interesting dish.  My dh &amp; I have never tried anything like this before.  It was a pleasant surprise. Quick and easy to make with a nice flavor.  I added a lot of hot pepper sauce to the beans, we like it hot.  We did prefer the beans the following day, the flavor of the sauce had permeated the meat more.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
13593,10637,6/20/2002,5,"This was really tasty.  I ended up marinating the chicken overnight and boy what a good flavor the chicken has.  Also I lightened up the recipe by using 1/4 cup of oil versus 1 cup and it came out great.  If there are any leftovers, I will shread the chicken and use in a fresh salad with a honey dressing.  This was very simple to prepare also.  YUM!!"
309629,10637,4/10/2006,5,"wow! fabulous! Served it with roasted green beans and coconut rice. Guest raved about it. I did not flatten the chicken, left the breasts plump and baked for 25 min. Came out nice and juicy. I thnk flattened and baked for longer might be dry. "
489214,10637,5/4/2007,4,"We marinated the chicken overnight.  The flavor was good, but the ""breading"" of flour got soggy when we baked it (after browning in oil).  Next time, I might skip the flour.  Also, we didn't flatten the chicken, and it turned out juicy and tender.  If I come up with any improvements next time, I'll comment again!"
626746,10637,12/12/2007,5,Yummy! It's worth the time and effort for this dish. This has become a new family favorite.
6258,37158,9/20/2002,5,A fantastic southern side-dish.  Bacon and yellow crookneck squash absolutely have to go together.  This was so good.  It was so very easy to make and the flavor is so good.  Thanks for posting this recipe...I will be using it a lot!
37868,37158,7/11/2003,4,"I love yellow crookneck squash. This is really a very good and easy recipe to follow...I did not change nothing..we loved it. I already had fried bacon in the freezer that I fried myself and saved the bacon drippings and so I picked up at the drippings and cooked the onions added the Squash and seasoned,Crushed the prefried bacon. Just so easy having all the having the bacon cooked and the bacon drippings all ready...Thank You  for a wonderful Veggie. Hugs"
39733,37158,2/10/2004,5,"Oh yeah, this is a delicious way to cook yellow squash. I poured out almost all of the bacon grease, just to lighten it up some. It still had the delicious flavor from the bacon drippings just not quite as much saturated fats. My MIL cooks squash this way and it is one of my husband's favorites. Thanks for posting it."
78770,37158,2/12/2004,5,"Yep, this has been my favorite way to fix yellow squash for over 30 years. Sometimes I toss a little  red or green bell pepper in with the onions for color.  "
212007,37158,8/18/2005,0,***** simply ... divine!
176615,37158,9/15/2005,5,"Wonderful! This is how to make ""a mess of squash,"" one of my favorites. I could eat only this for dinner and be perfectly happy. Easy recipe, proportions are just right. Along with salt at the end, I usually add a small pinch of sugar. Thanks, Mysterygirl, for posting!"
56003,37158,9/9/2007,5,"Thanks, Mysterygirl.  Taste's just like Mother used to make.  Can never have enough good squash recipes! Simple prep is always a selling point for me."
330545,37158,5/11/2009,5,"Awesome!  I must have eaten three of the four portions!  Made for a Taste of Yellow, Spring'09."
2001592532,37158,6/21/2017,5,It was easy and this was the first time I used bacon with squash and onions. Everyone loved it! But I poured most of the drippings out before I cooked the onions and squash.
46545,58209,6/5/2003,5,"Please don't be put off by the amount of garlic here folks!  I made this for my husband and 2 sons, who are not that crazy about garlic, and they all loved this.  I kept my chicken whole and baked it in an oven cooking bag.  It turned out perfectly.  The house smelled so good!  And the juices made a great gravy with a roasted garlic flavor.  "
118840,96211,9/25/2009,5,"Of the three recipes I made and reviewed for Fall '09 PAC, this was my favorite.  I liked it so much I've made it three times  :)  I took it to work for a potluck and it was devoured in no time ... AND I made the last batch and froze individual servings for lunches.  Wonderful, wonderful dish!"
198238,109578,2/28/2005,5,"I just made this for a church Bake Off and won ""Best Taste"" for it!  Did a couple variations... Used the Cake Mix Frosting (#104747... YUM!!) instead, and in the middle I put the cherries BETWEEN the frosting and chips.  Better visual effect to have two layers of white.  The chocolate curls and cherries on top made it look beautiful!  "
89831,109578,11/29/2006,5,"This is a great cake recipe, perfect to serve at holiday season to guests, I had to increase the icing sugar slightly in the whipping cream frosting (just personal preference) I also think I will increase the sugar in the cake batter next time I make it, great recipe BK!...Kitten :)"
169430,109578,4/8/2007,4,"This served double duty today. It was dessert for Easter dinner and also DH's birthday cake. I made it as a sheet cake using vanilla buttercream icing in place of the whipped cream and placed the cherry filling on top of that. Kato, it ask for ""cherry pie filling""  but drained and chopped? After reading that and the directions I wasn't sure if you wanted the pie filling or a can of cherries. I had the pie filling and used it all right from the can. It met with great guy approval. As no body else has mentioned this I guess it's just me but it didn't rise as high as I had hoped and I wondered if possibly the amounts of soda and baking powder should be reversed? DH says Thank You for a great birthday cake."
382071,109578,7/4/2007,3,This was good and pretty. I made it in a 13x9 glass pan. I baked the cake for 25 minutes but it was a little dry and didn't have much flavor. I drained and chopped the sweet dark cherry pie filling but wish I didn't...I think it would have been good to poke holes in the cake and then pour the complete filling over it with the glaze. I topped it with the whipped cream frosting. I omitted the white chocolate chips. Made for 1-2-3 hit wonders.
252514,128376,1/11/2008,5,"Mmmmm I'm munching on one with my morning coffee as I type. Love the hint of flavor present from the molasses and honey. Very tasty, thank you! :)"
442988,128376,2/10/2008,5,"I had to try these -- I'm in Boston, it's snowing outside, and I'm so homesick for L.A. I can't stand it!  I loved the Rose Cafe, and spent many an hour there in the early 1980s.  These muffins didn't disappoint.  I was very skeptical that they'd turn out OK; the batter was very thin.  But the flavor and texture turned out great.  I made 'em as mini-muffins and am very pleased with them.  Thanks for reminding me about the Rose Cafe, and thanks for a great muffin recipe!"
323134,128376,10/19/2008,5,"It is so good! I did exactly as the recipe stated and I go 24 mini muffins (17 minutes).  The raisins and the nuts (pecans) just added to the muffin, also, I loved the flavor of molasses. By the way, my batter was not thin at all, nice and thick."
160974,128376,5/22/2009,5,"These are excellent bran muffins- 
There's a bit more bran to flour ratio than I am used to, but it turns out I like that. It makes for a chewier texture (not as cake-like). I was glad I had buttermilk on hand because I think it keeps the texture good, without being too brittle.My favorite ingred. in bran muffins is molasses so I knew I'd like the flavor. I did think they were a bit faster to stir together than other recipes, too. Thanks Lynn, for posting.
Roxygirl"
252683,267687,12/8/2009,5,Used this recipe in my cooking class for the dairy unit.  It was easy to follow and the students had enough time to make it then eat it the next day.  thanks!
1234551,367376,5/5/2009,5,"This was so good!  We had sandwiches with it today, but I have leftover mashed potatoes from yesterdays meal; so that is luch tomorrow with the beef.  Can't wait, because it was good on the sandwiches, but I know it will be just as good on the potatoes.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
358544,367376,6/14/2009,5,"The meat was so tender!! Loved the sauce mix it cooked in. We had this on sandwhiches, but I think it would be good on rice also. Will have to try with rice next time! Thank you for a great recipe."
1325795,367376,7/16/2009,5,"Fabulous, one of the best recipes i have ever cooked.
karien"
1328781,367376,7/19/2009,5,"Thanks for the yummy recipe!  My boys all loved it and the house smelled so delicious as it was cooking!  We had it on rice and next time I think I will try the potatoes like others have suggested.  It's so nice to make an easy, quick meal which everyone gobbles up and asks for more!  Thanks Jacquelyn!  Theresa"
537617,367376,7/27/2009,5,This was really great!  We had it over mashed potatoes with kimchi  and a eggroll on the side.  I know it sounds weird but it was SO GOOD!  I cook alot of Korean food and this has most of the same seasonings as Bulgoki but tastes totally different.  It also just fell apart in the pot because it was so tender.  Thanks for a yummy new recipe!
4291,367376,7/28/2009,5,"This was easy and delicious, so my DH says, which is a terrific testament to the recipe...he usually says, ""it was alright.""  i don't eat roast.  I will make again.  JacquelynLee, thanks for posting a good recipe.  Sue"
1318815,367376,8/5/2009,5,"I wish I could give this one more than five stars!  We've just been to Ireland for a short break and I made this for a family gathering.  Every last bite was gobbled down, and several people asked me for the recipe.  A real winner!"
575070,367376,8/14/2009,5,This was a delicious recipe that the whole family loved!  We did as suggested and had it on hamburger buns.  My father even said it was better than the brisket we sometimes have on hamburger buns!
1372733,367376,9/2/2009,5,Loved it and it was a hit with the kids too which is always good!
749562,367376,9/21/2009,5,This was excellent!!!  Served when we had family over and everyone really liked it.  I cooked for 12 hours on low in my slowcooker and used a chuck roast.  I think I will double the gravy mixture next time because everyone wanted extra poured on their sandwiches and my leftovers have no sauce left.  Great recipe.  Thank you:)
141972,367376,11/9/2009,5,Very good - I used a flat iron roast - but sliced it into 2 inch slices first since I started the recipe a little late.  It was done in 3 and a half hours.  I increased the sauce by half based on comments but I don't think I would do that again as I had more than enough sauce.  Smells wonderful while cooking.
1141909,367376,1/4/2010,5,"OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!! Yum yum yum. So ridiculously easy to make, i had everything i needed in the pantry (except the roast of course). I used a 1kg lump of blade and it shrunk down to the tiniest amount, so next time i'm gonna put a monster in. I cant wait to have guests over to share this delicious meat with!!! Thank you so so much for sharing this delightful recipe."
311625,367376,1/22/2010,5,"Used an eye of round roast (about 3.5 lbs), doubled the sauce, and cooked for about 8 hours. It was super flavorful and tender, easy to shred. When my husband took his first bite he said ""OH yeah""...And he's not generally the most complimentary person! Served on recipe #183081 (which is the best bun recipe ever). Thanks JacquelynLee!"
146552,367376,1/24/2010,3,"I will fix this again but cut the sesame oil down.  The flavor of the sesame oil took over and was too strong for my taste.  Maybe it was the type of oil I used, but will fix this again cutting the sesame oil in half.  We served over mashed potatoes, but I felt that it would be better over rice.  Thank you for posting."
13483,367376,10/9/2010,5,Very easy and tasty recipe.  I minced the garlic and onion in a processor.  I also added some hoi sin sauce and hot sauce.  I did mince up the meat and there was quite a bit of it!!  Great  leftovers!!  Thanks for the post.
439797,367376,11/10/2010,5,Easy recipe.
28636,367376,12/21/2010,5,"Quick, easy and delicious.  DH ate it on a bun as you suggested and DD with rice - both were great!  I did cut the amount of sesame oil to suit my family.  Served with a salad of shredded napa cabbage, snow peas, onion and carrots tossed in an asian vinaigrette this made for a great dinner!  Thanks JacquelynLee :)"
502302,367376,12/29/2010,4,"We really liked this. After reading the reviews I halved the sesame, since I often find it too strong. I was happy with that. I used a boned-in chuck roast. I didn't have much time so had to cook it on high. We really liked it although the gravy was a little salty for my liking. I may just use water in place of the beef broth or reduce the amount of soy sauce next time. I served over mashed sweet potatoes. Told hubby of the suggestion of kaiser rolls and he said he would be interested in trying it like ""au jus"" and dip the rolls into the broth."
226863,367376,3/14/2011,4,"I loved how easy this is to make.  I decided to serve this on ciabatta rolls instead of kaiser rolls as suggested, and this worked out well.  Served au jus.  Topped it with a little shredded cabbage, and spread with mayo and horseradish.  This is very good!  I have leftovers, and will try those over mashed potatoes to test it out that way.  Made for PAC Spring 2011."
204024,367376,3/16/2011,5,"One of the best things to come out of my crock pot in months! Rich savory flavor, tender enough to shred with a fork.  We served it over rice with a few stir-fried veggies for color.  We like sesame a lot, so we used what the recipe called for and loved it.  Made for PAC."
1048179,367376,10/4/2011,5,This was a really tender moist roast. I was expecting a stronger Korean flavor but it more tasted like just a delicious roast. Next time I was thinking I could add pineapple while it is cooking in the crockpot and a bit more soy. I think that would be really tasty.
74567,367376,11/21/2012,5,"Simple and great taste. Served it over rice and some green pees, it's a keeper"
1396309,367376,3/12/2013,0,"I made this using petite sirloin steak and it didn't work out at all. I can't blame the recipe for that so I am not going to give this any stars just to be fair. My meat turned out really dry and pretty tasteless. Again I really can't blame the recipe for this, I just wanted to put out a warning to others to be careful which meat to use. I would like to try this recipe again with a longer cooking meat."
369715,367376,7/17/2013,5,This was really good. I mixed all the ingredients in a container so all I would have to do in the morning was dump it over the roast in the crockpot. I did only add 1/2 teaspoon of pepper as a whole teaspoon seemed a lot to me. I did forgot to add the onions but even without them this was so good. I cooked mine on low for six hours and then it was on warm for another three hours. The meat was really tender. I shredded the meat and put it on sandwiches with some of the gravy. Everyone loved it and they aren&#039;t always fans of my roasts in a crock pot.
8344778,367376,12/13/2013,5,"Legit and authentic! I&#039;ve had &quot;issues&quot; with making slow cooker pot roasts in the past.  This recipe hits the spot and has been a family favorite for some time now.  I do however deviate from the recipe a little bit by adding a bit more soy sauce and less sesame oil.  I also blend a onion, add onion powder, extra garlic and add some kiwi to tenderize.  This combination is what I use to marinate other Korean style meats - bulgogi, galbi, ddaktoritang.  Works out well and so simple to make.  Very delicious.  Also, if the roast is super big, I like to cut into smaller pieces and cook in low heat for at least 5 hours.  Serve with rice and kimchee.  Hits the spot."
307214,367376,2/13/2014,5,"Flavour was wonderful, but i had problems...  I thought I had a roast but instead all I could find were round steaks.  I would not advice repeating this substitution.  When serving, we had to cube the steaks because they just wouldn&#039;t be pulled!!  Meat was a little chewy but still had great taste and we served it with rice.  I would definitely try this again WHEN I HAVE A ROAST."
119956,367376,3/17/2014,5,"This was easy and good tasting. The first night I served it over rice with a green veg. Then we heated it up and had sandwiches. I used a two and a half pound pot roast which didn&#039;t have too much shrinkage. I didn&#039;t have the sesame oil so subbed veg oil without a problem. Thanks, JacquelynLee."
515278,367376,10/30/2014,5,Wonderful! I might try it with chicken thighs next time.
32058,367376,11/14/2014,5,"Followed recipe pretty much exactly, amazing flavor. &lt;br/&gt;I did sear the roast in veg oil before putting in the crockpot on High for 5 hours."
394077,367376,12/31/2014,4,Very easy and good.  Thank you.
829250,367376,3/9/2015,5,Very good! Ate with white rice and stir fry veggies.
50315,17083,12/22/2005,5,Favorite banana muffins for my family.
2001675217,367376,12/18/2017,5,"It was super easy and everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe and used four pounds of chuck roast. I didn’t use sesame oil because I was concerned that it might be overpowering. I used a little extra soy sauce, and I cooked the beef for eight hours on low. I think that cooking it longer would have been even better, but it was great at eight hours. I served the beef over mashed potatoes with stir-fry veggies. I plan to serve the leftovers on some form of bread yet to be decided."
545970,392334,8/11/2010,4,"I really liked this jam.  Nice texture and consistency.  Not overwhelmingly sweet like some jams can be.  I liked the layers of flavors but my jam didn't have any spicyness from the peppers.  I will admit that I was a little confused about exactly what to do with them.  Were the fresh cayenne peppers supposed to be chopped and added or left whole and added?  Whatever the case, I had only dried red cayenne peppers so I used that.  Only 1 and left it whole and then removed it before putting the jam in jars.  My neighbors really enjoyed this jam although my parents preferred your vanilla fig preserves.  Also I used Gran Gala instead of the Grand Marnier as that is what I had on hand.  Overall, this recipe is "" jammin' ""! lol."
825843,392334,9/2/2012,5,"This is a really complex jam! Orange on the front, and a gentle aftertaste of pepper on the end. I didn't have pectin, so I made do without, just cooked for a little longer to reduce and gel. It's really wonderful. Maybe a little sweeter than I wanted, but I think that's just because the figs on my tree were incredibly ripe at the time. Might try with less sugar next time. My only complaint is that I can't taste the rosemary enough. I might add more next time."
222564,392334,10/5/2013,5,"Wonderful flavors! Served with cheese and crackers, so good!"
2000143593,397561,4/15/2015,4,"I made this for dinner tonight. It was pretty good. I added a bit of soy sauce drizzled over it. Indeed it was a nice, simple, comfort food kind of dish. Thanks!"
25792,49152,3/26/2003,5,"Steph these are great, crust is just right, topping is carmelly and gooey, just a word to the wise don't cook it too long as it gets hard.  Ty for a great recipe, next time I will try with pecans."
34879,78253,2/11/2004,5,"YES!  Perfect, we used it like tacos the first time and the next was over rice.  Even tried it with egg as in your suggestion and it was very good.  DH wants me to make this again.(he is an egg nut, so it's a perfect supper for him)
Thanks SueL, your recipes are just right for us."
62675,78253,3/20/2004,5,Stuff this into green plantains which have been slit lenghtwise and bake until they are soft.  This is very very cubano.
333518,78253,7/13/2006,1,"If you like real, Cuban picadillo, stay away from this recipe !!! :( I grew up in South Florida with friends living with their Cuban, non-English speaking relatives. The relatives often cooked picadillo. Wonderful stuff!! My mother learned to cook picadillo from some of her close Cuban friends. Mama's version of Picadillo is awesome...but not diabetic-friendly; her recipe uses brown sugar and potatoes. I also eat in Cuban restaurants. None of those picadillo's have the overpowering taste of vinegar and cumin that this recipe has. Recommend replacing the cumin with oregano...that's more traditional. Recommend replacing the vinegar with either water or broth...you want to taste picadillo, not pickling juice. :( If you want to keep the seasonings, you might try adding some brown sugar. My mother's recipe uses brown sugar. BTW, the sofrito was very tasty, but overpowered by the vinegar and cumin. :("
464333,78253,11/23/2011,5,"I actually thought this was awesome!!! I LOVED the combo of flavors and, at first glance, it looks more complicated than it is. This one is definitely going to be in the regular rotation - thanks!!"
424680,99672,2/21/2008,5,"Here's a nice way to put everything in the same pot, so to speak! I used 3 chicken breasts, then increased the amount of OJ, lemon juice & rosemary! The increased juices gave the brown rice [that I served the chicken over] a nice taste, too! Certainly a keeper! [Tagged, made & reviewed for Newest Zaar Tag, 08A, game]"
1807042,99672,1/26/2011,5,"We have been using this recipe for over two decades.  Don't know where SWMBO found it but it was pre-WWW so I suspect some magazine or cookbook.  We have always enjoyed it served over rice.  We have also prepped it for camping trips over the years.  Bright, filling meal that everyone will enjoy (or should)."
425677,305380,6/2/2008,2,"This was okay.  I had trouble with the egg whites.  First they were too runny...then too hard... If I ever made this again, I would just omit the eggs all together.  The flavor was good, but the texture was kinda nasty... Made for ZWT 4 2008."
88099,133054,10/8/2005,5,Oh my.  This truly was delicious.  The combination of herbs was right on in my opinion.  This is not only a good veggie dip but is also good with chips.  Thanks Deely for a great one.
537179,289132,9/17/2009,5,This was really good. Made for Fall PAC 2009
222478,107410,4/20/2007,5,"Mmmm, really good curry that had fantastic flavour and some sweet and sour type characteristics that went together superbly with the duck! Rather than try and dice all the duck I left a lot of it whole like legs, wings etc which I thought added to the presentation.
I like a bit of heat in my curries so used a mix of three small hot fresh chillies, and one of each of a dried habanero, a chipotle and a jalapeno with all the seeds in place. Because of what was available I had to make a few changes, I used standard fresh basil instead of Thai, ginger instead of galangal and because I couldn't find any shrimp paste I dry-fried a handful of prawns (shrimp) for around 15 minutes, sliced and ground with the mortar and pestle. A really great meal served over rice, thanks Jewelies!"
54716,125843,7/7/2005,5,"Very Simple to make and delicious. The combination of macadamia nuts, Banana and brown sugar make this reipce a winner. Will definately be make this again."
236586,125843,8/16/2005,5,I made this for a Hawaiian themed party. It was DELICIOUS and moist. I will definitely make it again. In fact it will be my main banana bread recipe. GREAT. 
157425,125843,6/8/2006,5,Very good banana bread and love the macadamia nuts! I did have to bake mine a little longer for the middle to get done but so worth the wait. Thanks Rita!!
500635,125843,6/9/2007,5,This bread is absolutely incredible! Follow recipe as is and it's PERFECT! Thanks so much for the recipe.
96796,125843,6/12/2007,5,"This couldn't be easier and it's SO DECADENT. I could eat this every day, and the flavors take me back to my honeymoon in Maui. Thanks so much for posting!  One tip - using your hands, break apart any hard lumps in the brown sugar before mixing with the butter.  Otherwise you'll have lumps of it in your bread."
526666,125843,6/22/2011,5,"This was a great tasting bread, tho I should have baked for a little longer. I did add about 5 minutes to the 1 hour bake time, and 15 minutes would probably have been right. I love banana and macadamia nut ANYTHING, and this fits the bill. I'll keep it close, for when the pang of needing a nut bread strikes! Thanks for sharing, Rita~."
1802829537,125843,6/16/2014,5,"OMG, this is so amazingly lovely to eat. I just took it out of the oven and had some while it was steamy, and I&#039;m sure glad I did. If it&#039;s even better tomorrow, I&#039;m going to declare this the best thing I ever baked."
47510,169281,6/17/2006,5,Excellent salad.  I loved the flavors in the vinaigrette.  The salad was perfect for a light lunch.
68960,171633,2/5/2007,4,This is exactally Mum's old recipe and one that both my grandmother made. Out of the good old Edmonds cookbook. Thanks for posting Sharon!
618715,171633,6/7/2009,4,"I had just bought a large bunch of mint this morning and was looking for a sauce to make with it for lamb. This was quick, easy, and pretty good. I served this over Recipe#367872. Made for my teammate on the Epicurean Queens, ZWT5: Family Picks."
313120,184543,9/20/2006,5,Wonderful.  I wrapped the chicken breasts with the bacon and fried them to cut back on the baking time.  Also heated the soup mixture and added minced garlic to it.  Thanks for the great recipe.
641071,251555,1/22/2008,5,"This was really great!  We added more chili seasoning, but otherwise pretty much stuck to the recipe.  Thank you so much!  We enjoyed leftovers for lunch today."
303545,259553,11/1/2009,5,"Delicious!  I love a good punch with sherbert in it, and this fit the bill.  Ours however didn't turn out very green, but instead quite orange.  It was a big hit, and we were able to adjust the vodka to the tastes of our costumed guests :) Thanks for posting, Alia!"
346576,270076,12/8/2007,5,Loved them!  Very quick snack.  I didn't have said gadget (I missed the show this year :() so I just sliced the onions by hand.  Thanks for posting this recipe!
1782773,270076,7/21/2011,5,YUM! Came out perfect! So easy and tasty.
363420,270076,9/21/2013,5,awesome
269480,305380,6/2/2008,5,"I made these by zipping it in the microwave taking it out once to mix well then followed rest of recipe.  I somehow suggest waiting for about a minute or two before mixing the egg whites so it doesn't solidify from too much heat and for the texture to be smooth.  Overall, I enjoyed it! I love the coffee creamy taste and I will be making this again as it's an easy coffee custard to make. Thank you! Made for ZWT4."
510313,305380,6/5/2008,4,Made & reviewed for ZWT 4 ~ Kumquat's Kookin' Kaboodles! I thought this recipe looked interesting & am so glad I tried it! I left out the egg & used decaffe coffee so the kids could enjoy this with us (DS has raw egg allergy). I also tripled the recipe & it turned out perfect...light & creamy & a delicious dessert. Thanks!
1072593,305380,5/20/2010,5,I'll take this to go in the 'large' size. Made for ZWT 6.
223979,305380,5/27/2010,5,Yum!!  Turned out great.  I topped it with whipped cream and mini chocolate chips.  Made for ZWT 6.
107583,305380,8/22/2010,5,"Delicious!  For the coffee, I dissolved 2 teaspoons instant Espresso Powder in water, since I forgot to save some coffee from the pot.  After stirring in the egg, I tasted it and thought it was missing something, so stirred in a teaspoon of almond extract.  I am going to try other extracts also.  Orange I think would be good!  Made for tag game at Kittencalskitchen.com"
101732,327635,1/20/2009,5,"I was surprised that no one has reviewed this yet! It was very easy to put together and tasted great!! I was out of bread crumbs so I made Recipe #120329. I soaked the chicken in Kraft Ceaser Italian and cooked at 350* for 40 minutes, flipping half way through. This made a great lunch for my daughter and I! We had salad and a slice of buttered French bread on the side. Thanks so much for posting!! :)"
969481,327635,5/25/2009,5,We omitted the bread crumbs because we put this on our campfire.. Let the chicken breasts soak for about 6 hours poking small holes in the chicken so the dressing would get soaked up. So simple and yet so tasty!
513551,327635,8/21/2009,5,This was delicious and so easy to make. Thanks!
330505,327635,4/3/2010,5,"Very easy to make.  I had a problem keeping the bread crumbs on when taking off the tray, but that's okay it was still very light, tender and flavorful.  Thanks for posting!!!"
953275,373000,11/5/2009,5,"Fantastic! This will be my new go-to recipe for chicken. It greatly relies on the spice mixture...I used the one you have posted and just whittled it down to get roughly 3 tbsp. The mint MAKES this so I wouldn't omit it, even if you have to use dried. This literally took 5 minutes to throw together in the morning - let it sit all day, and then threw it in the oven at about 375....had a nice thin sauce to pour overtop as well because you get quite a bit of marinade here for the amount of chicken. I don't eat chicken, but I love this recipe and my family did as well. Thanks HH!"
477439,373000,3/14/2010,5,This is very good!! I marinated it for the day in the fridge and then baked it in the oven @ 375 for about 35 min. Very tasty Chicken. Thank you for posting the recipe!!
233238,379639,7/30/2009,5,"Yes, indeed, this is the best tabbouli salad I've made.  The fine grind bulghur does make a difference in the texture and cooking time.  I didn't have tamari soy sauce, though, so will buy some for the next time to see the difference.  Recommend this recipe to all."
126440,379639,8/12/2009,5,"I loved the flavor of this salad.  I'm not sure if my bulgur was #1 grind so let it sit for one hour, then added the other ingredients.  Loved the kick from the cayenne pepper.  Served it with Recipe #303946 and Recipe #93401."
1428015,379639,4/11/2010,5,"I made this recipe 3 times and after experimenting with a couple of additions, I love it.  I followed the recipe exactly and then added 1/2 of an english cucumber, chopped,  and 1 1/2 packets of raw sugar.   This reduced the acidity a little.  Shared with others who loved it also. Thanks for posting the recipe."
394077,379639,11/3/2011,5,I love this salad.  So refreshing and clean tasting...I can eat it with everything and everyday...so good...thanks for posting it.
2153320,379639,1/19/2012,5,"This recipe totally lives up to its name. The best! I made it with Quinoa instead of bulgar wheat and it was FABULOUS. I just prepared one cup of dry organic Quinoa per the packaging instructions and proceeded as stated. I kept all of the veggies and other ingredients the same as I think Quinoa poofs up a bit more than the bulgar wheat. Plus I like lots of stuff in my salad. I eased up by just a bit on the olive oil and red wind vinegar but I don't think the whole amount would make much difference. Also, I used about 4 parts parsley to 1-2 parts mint which I got from my garden and is stronger than the stuff you buy in the store. I probably had at least a full 3/4 cup of parsley when chopped. To me, it is hard to determine how much ""one bunch"" is, so that's how I handled it. GREAT, GREAT recipe. Seriously the best Tabouleh Salad I have ever made."
937635,379639,2/12/2012,5,Great recipe! I left out the mint because they didn't have any at the store. Next time I'll chop the parsley more finely. Excellent flavor. Thanks!
2332788,379639,7/17/2012,5,"Yummy! I substituted cilantro for one half of the parsley, because that is what I had and used garlic instead of the cayenne....wow."
7578910,379639,9/11/2013,5,"Tabbouleh has always been something I wanted to make, and this recipe is the one I will use every time! I substituted Quinoa in place of the bulgur, using 1 1/2 cups of dry Quinoa to 3 cups of water and cooking it according to the directions on its package. This made the perfect amount of Quinoa to veggie ratio since I prefer a more balanced salad. Any less Quinoa &amp; I think the parsley would have been too dominant. I used curly leaf parsley, which to me seemed to be just as flavorful as flat leaf but not as pungent. I chopped it very finely &amp; took other&#039;s advice &amp; measured 3/4 cup to 1 cup loosely packed. My &quot;1 bunch&quot; of green onions was 6 onions, &amp; I used the whole onion-- both the green &amp; the white. Where the recipe calls for 1 medium onion chopped, I only added 1/4 chopped to the salad, &amp; it was a little too strong even with such a small amount. So I suggest using a mild or sweet onion or leaving it out altogether; I thought the green onions gave it great flavor on their own. I used fresh garden mint as well &amp; only needed 1/4 cup or less after it was chopped. I used 16oz fresh cherry tomatoes quartered, &amp; kept the olive oil &amp; red wine vinegar as stated. Quinoa can be a little sticky so the oil really helped keep the texture of traditional tabbouleh. My only additions were 1 English cucumber finely chopped, which boosted the texture &amp; flavor immensely, &amp; about 2Tbls of balsamic vinegar to give the salad just a little bit of sweet without having to worry about granules of sugar showing up in the salad. I served this wonderful dish with hummus, pita bread, kalamata olives, &amp; marinated Greek chicken kabobs (recipe was from a different website). Everyone loved it all!! Thank you for sharing this recipe blucoat!!"
2032489,379639,1/30/2014,5,"A most excellent recipe! I cut the recipe in half.  No rice wine vinegar - used balsamic instead... and added cucumbers. It is the perfect balance of bulgar to parsley ratio.  A few years ago,I needed a last minute dish to take to a gathering.  Looking at what I had on hand and following a whim, I stumbled across a fantastic combo of mixing tabouli with a container of classic tuna salad (not mayonaisy) from Whole Foods. The flavors came together perfectly and it was a huge hit!  The whole room wanted the &quot;recipe&quot;.  Since then, when I make tabouli, I often add a can of Albacore tuna to the mix and Wa La(!) - an excellent meal that is appreciated by all.  Top with a slice of avocado and you have heaven on a plate. Without fail, recipe requests follow the first bite. It just works. In-joy."
2000192337,379639,5/8/2015,5,"I have made this several times with quinoa. It is truly the best tabbouleh I&#039;ve ever had! I use red onion, Italian flat-leaf parsley, cilantro (not too keen on mint leaves), red cherry tomatoes, and sometimes I&#039;ll add peas, green onion, cucumber, jalape&ntilde;o or Serrano pepper, and a little minced fresh garlic. The cayenne pepper is a must. Fabulous and healthy! Everyone I&#039;ve ever served it to loves it. Thanks for the awesome recipe."
1800290575,379639,5/11/2015,5,"I added lentils to this too for more protein. All the herbs, veggies and even the vinegar are from my garden. Great recipe and will make it again and again."
14410,401631,12/5/2009,4,"Tried as written...mixed eggs into rice and cooked together. Made a congealed mass that looked bad but tasted good. Next time, tried cooking the eggs first to a soft scramble, then removing and adding rice to the pan. Heated rice, added egg and remaining ingredients. Daughter doesn't like hot sauce, asked for soy sauce instead and liked it very much in her thermos for school lunch. We'll definitely make this again. Final note...cheese seems unecessary, just made it more gluey."
2002238605,401631,8/4/2018,0,"I agree with you about mixing eggs raw into the rice. Rice comes out too gooey. My Mom made it for breakfast when there was left over rice. That was sixty years ago when you really pinched pennies but it was so good I thought my family had extra money that week and we were having a &quot;gourmet&quot; breakfast. LOL. No need for the cheese either, just salt and pepper. I love it till this day and so will anyone with a bunch of younguns trying to make ends meet. It's not only great for breakfast but good for lunch too. Make it and you decide."
125388,27615,1/1/2009,4,"Good roast with rich beefy sauce.  I probably would have preferred to thicken the sauce a little to make it more like a gravy than an ""au jus"" sauce."
64642,86560,3/15/2004,4,This is a wonderful comfort food.  We also make oyster stew the same way.
282824,86560,1/10/2008,5,"I am a born and bred northern New Englander and it is a pleasure to see a simple traditional Fish Chowder recipe shared that is made in the old Yankee manner without a lot of spices, etc. added.  I, my mother, grandmother and great-grandmother made/make Fish Chowder exactly as jneen has shared here.  If you want a true but simple and tasty New England flavor try this recipe."
54678,86560,10/27/2008,4,The soup was good but lacking in flavour - our fish was pike which was what we had on hand.
588188,86560,4/20/2013,5,"This is very much like my family&#039;s recipe, except we use salt pork cut into lardons instead of the bacon. I like to add a can of peas, or sometimes a can of cream corn as well."
305531,89253,8/7/2006,5,"Very good bread.  What's not to like about bread, roasted garlic, and mushrooms! I couldn't find arugula, so we used romaine.  Our only problem was that they were hard to eat as a salad - the bread was more difficult to cut.  So we  added the lettuce on top and ate them as more of a bruschetta. Next time, I would cut the bread into cubes.  Thanks BK."
409184,89253,8/5/2007,5,"Fabulous!! Loved by all. We actually ended up eating it just like lazyme, stacked on top of the bread and it was quite yummy! I know we'll be making this often. I did add one thing - before grilling the bread on the George Foreman, I brushed it lightly with fat free Italian Dressing. I just didn't like the idea of grilling it dry. I also used green leaf instead of arugula, we just can't get it here very often. Thanks for a keeper!!!"
527607,89253,8/6/2007,5,"Superb!  I made this as part of a menu #8077 and it was my appetizer as i waited for the shrimp to marinate.  Really good.  I subbed cilantro for parsley because my parsley had turned off, but i think it was a great substitutions."
288218,89253,3/13/2008,5,I loved it! I made it as a salad and I enjoyed so much. Arugula and mushrooms are my favorites so its balsamic. I made it as it said but next time I'll cut the bread as croutons.. Thanks so much for sharing!
89831,89253,5/22/2008,5,"this is just so delicious! I omited the roasting of the garlic, I keep roasted garlic pate in my freezer, also I omitted the fresh parsley as I did not have any, I plan on growing my own soon and I do not want to purchase anymore, this salad dish has tons of flavor which is what my family loves, thanks for sharing BK!"
166642,89253,6/28/2008,5,This is wonderful! This has such great flavor with ingredients I really enjoy. Yummy! Made for ZWT4 for the Tastebud Tickling Travellers.
266635,89253,4/24/2015,5,"OMgoodness, this bread is absolutely delicious.  If you are a fan of roasted garlic and mushrooms, you will love this.  We did not use the arugula -- just grilled the bread and slathered it with lots of roasted garlic and then smothered the bread with mushrooms.  This recipe is going into my Best of 2015 file -- will be making this recipe again and again."
2311662,116672,7/1/2012,5,"This is so fast and easy. I love it so much!! My 20 month old loves it, my husband loves it"
89831,133054,8/19/2005,5,"Five stars and more for this wonderful dill dip! the only change I made was I added some fresh minced garlic into it, and doubled the recipe but kept the dill at 1 teaspoon, as I will be taking this wonderful dip over to friends tonight. Thanks for a fabulous recipe, and one that I will make again!...Kittencal:)"
192972,133054,4/19/2006,5,"My hubby really liked this, and called it ""killer"".   I discovered it was wonderful with fish sticks instead of tartar sauce!!"
156034,133054,4/30/2006,5,"Deely....this stuff was awesome!  Thank you for making some for our visit.
I'm going to whip up a batch tomorrow!!"
223333,133054,10/31/2006,5,Wonderful. Nice change from ranch dressing. Will be making again. My hubby loved it. Gets better with time. I made mine 8 hrs in advance.
329282,133054,11/26/2006,5,"I made this dip last night and it really was delicious.  I picked this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand. Thanks for posting.  I think next time I will serve it with some rye bread, yum!!"
60992,133054,5/20/2007,5,I have made dill dip this way for WELL over 30 yearas. Infact as a young girl I had it at a friends asked for the recipe and brought a new tradition into our family. You cannot have a holiday without this. Thanks for sharing THE perfect dill dip recipe.
268464,133054,11/23/2007,4,Great Dip . . . perfect for veggies and chips.  Thanks for sharing.
354628,133054,2/17/2008,5,"This is AWESOME! Just between my husband and I, it disappeared in two days."
452749,133054,2/12/2010,5,I've made another variation of this recipe for years but decided to try yours-so glad I did!!! It was absolutely delicious!!! I've always eaten dill dip on Breton Original Crackers (sold at most grocery stores) and for some reason this dip is perfect for these crackers. I will use your recipe from now on! Thanks for sharing this!
131021,133054,5/21/2010,5,"This is very similar to a dip my MIL gave me years ago, in fact she made tubs of it for our wedding. Good stuff and made with all sorts of stuff that you already have in hand. Yum."
264017,133054,5/23/2010,5,"Ooh, this IS delicious! I made half the recipe just in case we didn't like it. It wasn't long after the first taste that I knew I'd be making the whole batch soon. It's so creamy and full of flavor! I used lite Hellman's and light sour cream. I had no tobasco, so I added a dash of hot sauce. Just great! Thanks Deely."
366781,133054,6/19/2010,5,This was wonderful.  Not the usual dill dip so my DH loved it.  Made no changes and served it with veggies and chips.
1179225,133054,10/31/2010,4,"Really good. When I make it again, I think I'll use a little less mayo. Thanks for posting the recipe."
37107,133054,6/20/2011,5,"I have been making this for a couple of years and can't believe I haven't rated it yet.  This recipe is one of the easiest I've made.  The ingredients are what I usually have on hand and it goes together real fast.  I do however use chopped green onion instead of the minced onion, and I double the dried dill because I think it needs more.  Other than that, this is the veggie dip I ALWAYS go to."
32058,133054,12/29/2011,5,Yum!  I halved this to see if we would like it.  I love it and it hasn't even had time to blend properly yet. Tomorrow it will be amazing I am sure and I was thrilled to have had everything on hand.
198154,133054,2/2/2013,5,I used low fat mayo and sour cream and it still got 5 stars from the entire family!  I immediately added this to my cookbook. No need for all those other dill dip recipes.  This is my go to dip from now on.
550557,133054,12/26/2014,5,Where has this recipe been all my life!!???
107135,135585,4/2/2006,5, i love buffulo wings and this makes it easy 
53932,135585,4/10/2006,5,This is a lower calorie and neater way to enjoy Buffalo chicken.  Loved the sauce.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.
33159,135585,4/23/2006,5,"Very satisfying & flavourful way to do chicken - tasted just like wings!  I browned the chicken on the Foreman Grill.  I think next time, I will double the sauce so the chicken ends up saucier.  We don't care for blue cheese dressing so I just served with roasted potatoes & they were great!"
60260,135585,4/26/2006,5,Everyone loved this chicken! I used Frank's Hot sauce and made the recipe as is.  I was leary of the vinegar but it worked well and I liked the addition of the celery seeds.  We made ours into Buffalo Chicken sandwiches - yum! Next time I might make just a little more sauce to add after the chicken is cooked. We are wing lovers and this sure makes getting that taste easy.
196296,135585,5/25/2006,5,"This was absolutely yummy, and very easy!!!  I like that I could eat ""buffalo"" sauce without all the fat!  I made extra sauce to drizzle over the chicken when it was cooked, and I ""scored"" the chicken breasts so they would have more of the sauce on them.  Marinated them in the sauce for about 1/2 hour first.  It was a lovely warm night so I grilled them on the BBQ.  Served them with creamed spinach, which went very well with them.  Thank you Sherribabi - what a fun recipe!"
217226,135585,6/29/2006,4,"All I can say about this chicken...is HOT! It was tasty and I like that it was low-calorie, but it was too much for the kids. Those who like the heat though, loved it! We served with ranch dressing instead of blue cheese, and baked as directed. "
328077,24554,12/16/2006,5,Excellent dish that has become a staple in our house. Thank you.
237330,135585,7/13/2006,5,"Fabulous! The taste of real wings without the mess of frying and without the ton of butter. I'll be making this often for my ""heat-seeking"" teenager. Thank you SO much! "
294700,135585,8/5/2006,5,Delicious and easy!
58439,135585,9/23/2006,4,"This was TERRIFIC too!
No mucking around with frying wings too!
Used Chilli Hot Sauce for quite the ZING!
For those who appreciate authentic Buffalo wings, this is the THING!"
269891,135585,11/7/2006,5,"Yummy, easy, and quick. We had it with mashed potatoes, and a salad with carrots and celery topped with the blue cheese dressing"
246936,135585,2/3/2007,5,Hubby adored this. Will make again!!!! Thank u so much!!!! He said if he could give it 20 stars he would!!!
355637,135585,2/7/2007,4,"This was pretty tasty!!! I like hot stuff, and this wasn't really hot enough for me, but I think I will just need to find hotter sauce. My husband lives for Buffalo Wild Wings, so it was nice to have something comparable at home!! Yum and easy!!"
173314,135585,2/14/2007,4,"We enjoyed this alot and I used leftover chicken by cutting up and putting in my salad with blue cheese dressing.  Might make again as a sandwich with blue cheese, lettuce, and tomato on a roll. :)"
47907,135585,3/4/2007,4,We enjoyed this recipe for dinenr last night.  I made as psoted except I didn't have any celery seeds so I added some celery salt and it worked fine.  The recipe was very easy to make.  I might try and cut up the chicken into strips next time and bake them that way.  Thanks so much for posting!
280271,135585,3/6/2007,5,"5 WW points!!! This is the same recipe that I have in an old 1999 weight watches cookbook called "" Cream of the Crop"" It is excellent! Nice and Hot and easy to prepare. DH and I both really enjoyed this. Thanks, Sherribabi for posting."
229850,135585,3/20/2007,4,"Thought these were good, but a little too tangy. Might cut down on the vinegar next time, or leave it out. Thanx for posting."
453924,135585,3/26/2007,5,"This was a HUGE hit! It was so simple to make! I doubled the sauce and before putting the chicken into the oven, I shredded it a little with two forks. I served it on toasted kaiser buns with shredded cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, lettuce, tomato, and onion. It was superb! A new favorite!"
159243,135585,3/27/2007,5,This was great!  And I left out the margarine to save on calories!  It was even better the next day sliced into a salad.  Thank you!
167242,135585,4/21/2007,4,"This was really good!  I used chicken tenders sauteed with a coating of garlic powder for a bit of extra flavor, and this turned out great."
361680,135585,4/22/2007,5,"I loooove buffalo chicken wings, so I thought I'd give this a try. I didn't add the celery seeds, since I didn't have them on hand and it turned out great. After cooking, I let the chicken rest for a few minutes, and then I sliced it and created a deconstructed buffalo chicken wing salad. Iceburg lettuce, blue cheese dressing, carrots, celery and tomatoes and croutons. This is definitely a easy staple from now on."
369597,135585,5/16/2007,5,Everyone loved it. WE had been looking for a baked version of Buffalo wings. This was great. I will make it again.
394810,135585,5/24/2007,5,"This tasted just like buffalo wings.  I doubled all of the sauce ingredients, except for the margarine.  I used Frank's Hot Sauce.  DH used light ranch dressing to dip his chicken in while I ate it plain."
39301,135585,9/6/2007,5,Fantastic!  I didn't change a thing and we loved this dish.  I'm sure I'll be making it frequently.  Thanks very much for posting this winner.
225179,135585,10/28/2007,5,"Thanks, Sherribabi.  I've made this twice in the last week.  It's great and the leftovers make a great salad for lunch the next day."
311566,135585,11/8/2007,5,Really enjoyed this... I doubled the sauce and will be making this again soon. Thanks!
537578,135585,11/17/2007,5,Yum Yum Yum!!!!  Would give this 10 stars if I could!!  Didn't add the vinegar and we still loved it!  Big fans of buffalo chicken in this house.  I used a little more hot sauce and it was perfect for us!  Thanks for such a great recipe!
371738,135585,11/18/2007,5,Absolutely delicious and A LOT less work than with buffalo wings.  No dressing needed.  Just the perfect kick!  Thanks.
604426,135585,11/18/2007,5,"This was absolutely fantastic!!!  The marinade tasted just like the real buffalo chicken wing sauce.  I had a cocktail party, so I used boneless skinless breasts which I cut into chunks (to be picked up with toothpicks) and poured the marinade over before baking.  I also used apple cider vinegar and omitted the celery seed because we were out of them.  This was a terrific and unbelieveably easy recipe to make.  All of our guests LOVED this recipe.  Thanks so much  for submitting this.  I will be looking for more delicious recipes from you!!"
534623,135585,11/25/2007,4,"This was a nice quick dinner, with pretty easy clean up. We topped ours with some shredded cheese and let it melt at the end of the baking process."
478451,135585,11/26/2007,5,"This is an excellent recipe.  I asked my youngest if it was too hot for him and he said that it was a bit hot for him, but the flavour made up for the heat.  Thank you for such an easy, tasty chicken dish."
344938,135585,12/3/2007,5,"This was delicious.  I used Franks Red Hot and I can't believe it's not butter... only 2 chicken breasts but kept the other ingredients the same.. I liked the extra sauce, but beware, the concentrated sauce is Salty!  It could be because of the red hot, but for whatever reason, I like salt and it was a bit overwhelming.  Love buffalo chicken but cannot stomach the skin and bone on chicken wings.  Liked others suggestion to bake more and eat leftover on a salad or even a wrap would be great!  Thanks for sharing, this ones a keeper."
226462,135585,12/7/2007,5,My family loved this!  Super easy and quick to throw together after work.  Thanks for posting!
383853,135585,1/14/2008,5,"I tried this recipe a long time ago and never reviewed it.  It was fantastic.  Now that I've found it again, I'm going to make it soon! I served it with ranch instead of the blue cheese.  Easy and yummy supper."
227652,135585,1/15/2008,4,"My husband really enjoyed this! I made one chicken breast & cut the sauce in half, but I only used a really small amt of celery seeds, and a little less vinegar (used the cider kind) & butter. It was so easy & smelled wonderful! I served it on a bun for him, with some fat free ranch dressing. Will make it for him again!"
49561,135585,1/18/2008,5,"Tried this last night and it was just yummy!  We marinated this for about Â½ hour (like someone suggested below) and did the rest of the directions.  We added some shredded mozzarella on top.  Publix has this great blue cheese dressing made with yogurt (low fat, low cal) and I poured just enough on my chicken.  We served it with Spinach & Beans #70147â€¦ what a great side with this great main dish.  Thanks!!"
497077,135585,2/6/2008,5,"I love this recipe-not only because it tastes wonderful but it is sooooo easy! I wanted to serve this as an appetizer during the Super Bowl so early in the day, I browned the chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces, and marinated in sauce until ready to bake. Bake time was just under 20 minutes. I served w/ ranch and blue cheese dressings, celery sticks, and extra sauce. Everyone loved it especially since it was a lot easier to eat than regular buffalo wings. DH and I had leftovers the next night and they turned out great, too! Thank you for a great recipe!"
123871,135585,2/7/2008,5,I made this without the celery seed. My chicken was partially frozen so my sauce was runny. I put it on the stove with flour and thickened it.I also didn't fry the chicken I put it in the oven with the sauce at 350 for an hour. This was very good and easy. Thanks!
632249,135585,3/16/2008,4,"A really good easy dinner, enjoyed by all.  I made exactly as written but there is one thing I would change...next time I would bake the chicken for 15 minutes or so (after browning) and drain the grease as I found it diluted the yummy hot sauce. Overall, a great dish! Thx Sherribabi"
183817,135585,3/18/2008,5,"Made this for dinner last night when I was craving buffalo wings. YUM!! Very easy to make. I followed the recipe almost exactly -- I did use  about a teaspoon of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter instead of the tablespoon of margarine. I used the thin cut chicken breasts, so they were ready at about 19 mins. Great way to get the wing flavor without the mess and fat!  Thanks."
55773,135585,5/13/2008,5,"Not very hot but BIG on taste...Made it twice now...Added a splash of Worcestershire sauce...

I also sprinkled the chicken with 'Durkee Grill Creations-chicken and rib rub' prior to frying (love that stuff)...

Used 2 xtra breast halves to have leftovers for topping on a garden salad...

Cut the chicken into good sized strips so it wouldn't dry out during cooking...

This is now one of our regular menus..."
470351,135585,7/5/2008,5,Holy cow!!! WONDERFUL!  Not super hot...just perfectly hot.  Not for kids probably.  We LOVED THIS!!!!  Who the heck needs fatty hot wings that are deep fried and loaded with fat when you can make this dish and it's easily just as good?  We devoured this and I had hoped for leftovers.  For the first time ever I didn't change ANYTHING!.  I guess except serving this with lite ranch vs blue cheese since I hate blue cheese. I served this with cheesy orzo and garlic artichokes...both from this site.  We are in heaven!!! Thanks for posting!
897632,135585,7/20/2008,5,This recipe is definitely a keeper! As some others have suggested: you can skip the 1/2 cup fat free blue cheese dressing (approx 180cals in total) and the meal is still delicious!
440735,135585,7/24/2008,4,I used Frank's hot sauce. The chicken had some zing to it. I may choose another type of hot sauce next time.  It was good and easy.
718620,135585,10/5/2008,3,"this was ok, definitely not buffalo sauce though...i'll stick with the premade buffalo sauce i buy in the store - i still can't figure out what makes them different, but there is something"
284922,135585,10/28/2008,5,"We enjoyed this very much!  As a big fan of Buffalo Chicken we were especially impressed with this recipe.  I think the celery seed may be a key ingredient!  I served each breast on a hamburger bun with a little lettuce, onion, and ranch (it made a great Buffalo Chicken Sandwich!) alongside a bowl of pizza soup.  Thanks so much for posting your recipe it is really fantastic and we will certainly have it again and again! :)"
354638,135585,12/3/2008,5,Wow. This was absolutely amazing! The chicken was soooo incredibly moist! I served it with skillet potatoes and it was *almost* like being at buffalo wild wings! (course though - nothing beats bw's lol) - but it was AWESOME!!!!
680579,135585,12/23/2008,5,Great recipe!  I will be making this regularly.  The only change I made was to double the sauce.  Thanks so much for sharing.
813470,312061,8/5/2008,5,Made this with fish and was wonderful.  Very different from most veg. sides I make.  The tomatoe mixture was wonderful and loved all the cheese on top.  Also worked for the low carb diet my husband is doing...
368897,135585,1/22/2009,5,"This was absolutely delicious!  I didn't have any blue cheese dressing on hand but my fiancee thought this would have been even more awesome with it, so I will make sure I have it next time.  I followed the recipe exactly, and added some low fat shredded mozzarella cheese on top before baking.  It was off the charts and it couldn't get much easier than this.  I will make this often, thank you so much for posting this recipe!!"
222433,135585,2/20/2009,5,We love buffalo chicken anything at our house! Really good and easy! Thanks for a keeper Sherribabi.
353131,135585,3/13/2009,5,Really great way to have buffalo chicken without all the work!
387750,135585,3/23/2009,4,"This was good, but I think it would be better if the chicken was marinated in the hot sauce before it was baked, just to give it more a little more flavor. But over all it was good and I will make this again!"
169712,135585,4/13/2009,4,"This was great! Instead of celery seed and pepper, I used celery salt and some smoked paprika.  I made extra sauce, which gave me plenty to marinate in--which I will do again.  (Three hours marinating seemed to do the trick) Oh, and I omitted the margarine."
344087,135585,4/15/2009,5,"this is a great wat to do chicken and makes great southwestern subs with the leftovers...worthy of more than five stars. I also cook extra now for use in buffalo chicken pizzas and it freezes well so it makes a homemade pizza very handy for supper. An on another note, this makes great chicken sandwiches with chilled mayo with dry ranch mixed with it."
352814,135585,4/25/2009,5,"Great recipe!  I sliced my chicken breast in half lengthwise and coated with the sauce.  I deleted the celery seed because it just didn't appeal to me.  Next time, I will probably double the sauce because I would have like a little more sauce to drizzle on top of the chicken.  Served with homemade ranch dressing.  This was delicious, thanks!"
444967,135585,6/1/2009,5,"This was excellent!  I used bone in skinless breasts and scored the meat after I browned it.  Then marinated for two hours before baking. Be sure to use a nice small pan so that juices stay up around the chicken.  Served with coleslaw and celery sticks w/ranch dressing.
Oh - I also tripled the sauce.  Double probably would have been fine. Thanks MoonPoodle!"
647181,135585,6/8/2009,5,I made this tonight and served it on buns as buffalo chicken sandwiches.    My fiance and I both enjoyed them.  I doubled the sauce and the only change I made was using fat free ranch instead of blue cheese.  That just happened to be what I had in the house.  We'll be putting this on our menu
846154,135585,6/22/2009,5,"Yum!  Just like hot wings but without so many calories and fat!  After looking at the other reviews, I doubled my sauce and I am so glad I did!  I think next time I will cut back on the celery seed - it wasn't bad but I didn't really need that much.  Thanks for an easy, go-to dish!"
1145840,135585,7/29/2009,4,"Let's see..my small changes: I didn't have celery seed (poor planning on my part) and I actually tripled the sauce.  Oh, and I had really thick chicken breasts (2 at about 1/2 lb each) so I actually cut them up into smaller pieces.  That may be why I needed extra sauce.  

This was very yummy, but I wish the sauce was a bit thicker.  I'll try to make the sauce a bit thicker next time, and maybe play around with breading the chicken.  

We served it with mashed potatoes and it was a perfect complement!"
544540,135585,8/31/2009,5,Super Easy and delicious!  I love it with blue cheese and celery.
358698,135585,9/3/2009,4,"This was really good - satisfied my love of buffalo wings in a healthier way.  Used my all time favorite hot sauce - Frank's.  Changes: I cut the chicken breast into strips, made double the sauce and kept some warm on the stove for serving.  Also used 1/2 the celery seeds and felt it was plenty for our tastes.  No other changes.  Next time I will try to thicken up the sauce for personal preference.  Served with ranch dressing (out of bleu cheese).  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a keeper."
113509,135585,9/25/2009,3,"This recipe didn't quite work for Hubby & I. The taste of the sauce was fine, but the sauce slides right off of the chicken. I had salted & peppered the chicken before baking it, and I was glad because that was all the flavor we had. If we did make this recipe again, I think we would either thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry to maybe get it to stick to the chicken, or possibly just marinate the chicken in the sauce. With a little tweaking I think this is a good recipe. Thanks for posting."
13483,135585,9/30/2009,5,This was a really neat and easy recipe to do.  Not quite the messy and greasy wings   but this healther version had just as much taste.  Blue chees and hot chicken just go together very well.  So glad you posted this recipe Sherribabi
231057,135585,10/7/2009,5,I loved this chicken!  Didn't use celery seed or blue cheese dressing but it was great!  Wrapped it in a tortilla with low fat mozz cheese...perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe.
189475,135585,10/10/2009,5,"Excellent! I doubled all the ingredients except the chicken and celery seed and cooked it all in the crockpot. Once it was done I shredded the chicken and then let it sit for 30 more minutes to soak in the sauce. Then I mixed in more blue cheese dressing to make the sauce more creamy and less watery. I ate it like a dip and dipped tortilla chips in it. I still had some sauce left so I poured it over tortilla chips, topped with mozzarella cheese and melted the cheese in the microwave for 40 seconds. Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
85018,135585,10/13/2009,5,"Great and so simple and easy.  Uses things always in the pantry!  Only thing different, we used lite Ranch dressing!  Gonna try AmandaMcG's idea and make these into sandwiches!  Thanks for the recipe--it'll be well used here!"
227607,135585,10/14/2009,5,"This was one of those recipes that the whole family loved(2 adults and 5 children).  I soaked the chicken in ranch before browning.  I tried to coat a few in flour before browning but it did not make it any better so I did not do it on most of them.  I doubled the recipe.  We just had this with celery, carrots, cheese and tomatoes with ranch dressing on the side.  I have used the leftovers 2 days for sandwiches for lunch.  This is an easy and wonderful recipe."
1336278,135585,10/27/2009,5,"This is very good. 

One note- DON'T leave out the celery seed. I hate celery itself but the seeds really 'make' this dish. My roomate is a really picky eater and even he likes celery seed now."
1245777,135585,10/30/2009,5,I love chicken wings buy my husband doesn't like to eat things that have bones in them.  So I really wanted buffalo chicken wings and found this receipe.  It was amazing.   The chicken came out very tender.
1442937,135585,11/10/2009,0,Soooo good.  Im so happy to have found this recipe.  My 7 year old son is the pickiest little eater but he ate a whole chicken breast and asked for seconds.  My family was so pleasantly suprised that baked buffalo chicken could taste so much like real fried buffalo chicken...in my opinion even better!  Thanks!
1348891,135585,11/13/2009,5,"I made this last night. It was hottt!! Very good. My hubbie loved it, he couldn't stop talking about how great the meal was. We love going to Hooters or Buffalo Wild Wings and since money is a little tight with the holidays coming, this hit the spot. Thanks for posting!!"
106614,135585,11/15/2009,5,"Wowza!  DH and I love, love spicy food and I figured this would be on the mark, but WOW.  Still trying to figure out how this combination results in such a HOT sauce.  Loved it.  Served w/ blue cheese dressing, roasted potatoes.  WONDERFUL."
1179225,135585,11/21/2009,4,Really good! Next time I'll make a little more sauce. Thanks for posting.
1466118,135585,12/4/2009,4,"I decided to not cook chicken before.. thought it would be easier, I think you definitely need to, or the sauce is too runny-  I added paperika and garlic powder to the hotsauce because a place near me makes their chicken wing sauce with it...it adds good flavor... good substitute for fried wings"
229787,135585,12/13/2009,5,"This is a very good recipe that I have been meaning to rate since I have made it 3 times already. :) The first time I made this I went exactly as the recipe says...Everyone liked it..I however did not like the celery seed...so the times after I made it I left out the celery seed and loved it! (no one even noticed) =) 
This is actually on my menu for dinner this week...I too doubled up on the sauce! I use Frank's Hot Wing Buffalo sauce...only because we like the taste of it better and it's a bit thicker.
Great easy recipe! Thanks for sharing!"
178742,135585,12/23/2009,5,"This was sooooo good! I followed directions exactly. The only thing I did differently was double the sauce! We loved it, it tasted just like our local wing place Roosters. Next time I think I will do chicken breast strips/tenders.
Thanks for an awesome recipe!"
1168372,135585,1/10/2010,5,"This  is the 2nd time I've made this dish, and forgot to rate it.  It is an excellent dish, as long as you like the hot sauce.   Thanks for a great recipe."
448338,135585,1/21/2010,5,"This was great!  I had about 4 med-large sized chicken breasts so I kept everything the same except tripled the hot sauce and left out the blue cheese.  Also, instead of browning in skillet, I drizzled chicken w/olive oil, seasoned w/Grill Mates Montreal Chicken Seasoning and threw it on the foreman grill for a few minutes.  Poured the sauce over then finished in the oven at 375 for about 15-20 minutes.  Sprinkled w/monteray jack cheese and served on a toasted wheat bun. Very yummy!!"
693482,135585,2/7/2010,4,"I thought the flavor was fine with these, but it doesn't ""hit the spot"" if you're looking for buffalo wings. Without the crispy coating and thick sauce, it's just not buffalo to me. If you don't mind going without those things, though, this is the recipe for you!"
1526284,135585,2/26/2010,4,"Very good!  The sauce has just the right amount of heat from the hot sauce.  

People should know that this is not a thick sauce that clings but rather a thin one.  Also, it does not have the exact flavor of classic/traditional/original Buffalo sauce.

The sauce does have a little too much celery seed for my taste, so next time I will decrease it and I will also add some salt to it."
166294,135585,4/19/2010,4,"We really enjoyed this dish tonight.  I didn't realize the sauce would be so thin so that's why I only gave it 4 stars.  We added extra hot sauce and served it with the fat free blue cheese (didn't think I'd like that, but I did) and it was a lovely dinner.  I served it with sauteed zucchini and creamy rice.  Thanks!"
951955,135585,5/22/2010,5,"awesome! I noticed the sauce was a little thin, so when the chicken was done I took them  out, put the sauce back in the frying pan and reduced it. It thickened up and tasted great, had to add a teaspoon of margarine to it. Thanks for the great recipe :)"
1017863,135585,1/14/2011,5,"This combination of flavors was great. I did season the chicken evenly on both sides with (Sazon Goya Picante) which has Habanero and Guajillo chiles seasoning. I also duplicated the recipe since I made a lot more chicken. I used Franks red hot extra hot sauce and buffalo wing sauce. The sauce was thin but I let it seat in the oven a few more minutes to thickened up a little more. The left over sauce we saved and used it the next day on Skirt steak, also added sauce to egg salad and it was wonderful. Thanks for this great recipe.  :~)"
1016620,135585,2/1/2011,4,"Being from Buffalo, I am very picky about my wings. While this recipe will never replace wings, I think it is a good recipe when you want something spicy and can't get out to get wings. I think that if i were to make it again, i would leave out the celery seed, at least on mine, my hubby liked the celery seed."
21752,258142,11/1/2007,5,"As the recipe states, this is perfect for the weekday. I used a local fish called Nile perch and cut it up into serving-size fillets.  The mayo kept the fish lovely and moist.  We had this with baked potatoes and a simple Israeli salad, and for a Wednesday night, it was perfect!"
1898667,135585,5/1/2011,5,"I made this last night and it was delicious! I, too, used Frank's brand buffalo sauce (every restaurant I've ever worked at or loved the wings from uses Frank's!). I didn't have celery salt so I skipped it but I'll try it next time. I had chicken breast cutlets so I used those and they came out so flavorful and moist. Few things: I dredged the chicken in flour before I browned it to give it a slight coating, I used REAL butter (because I think margarine is a joke), I used more sauce (enough to really coat both sides of all 8 of my cutlets), and I sprinkled them with sesame seeds (just because I see a lot of places do this with their wings so it seemed like a good idea!). Thanks for a great recipe that made my new husband think I'm some sort of a good cook!"
1723464,135585,8/21/2011,4,"A very easy and tasty recipe!  I did double the sauce as recommended by many, and agree that the amount of celery seed should be reduced.  Next time I'm going to adjust by cutting the celery seed in half, reducing the hot sauce by 25% and replacing with some Durkey sauce."
244264,135585,8/26/2011,5,I've made this about three times in the last few weeks and we love it. Frank's Hot Buffalo sauce has a little more heat in it and that was our favorite.  I think I'll make it again tonight...
928301,135585,11/3/2011,4,"Tastes good.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I doubled the sauce recipe but only used one serving of celery seed.  I also added a measure of garlic powder and paprika & I used Louisianna Hot Sauce.  I coated my chicken with flour before putting on the stove.  I didn't have to pound it & it baked to a nice juicy doneness.  I put the sauce on the stove a bit to thicken it afterward."
369715,135585,11/15/2011,4,This was good and easy to make. I doubled the sauce based on the other reviews but didn't double the celery seed. I actually didn't eat this because I don't eat hot wings but the rest of the family enjoyed this. Hubby said it was really spicy but the sauce was thin.
1624417,135585,12/15/2011,0,"Delicious but not too spicy. I doubled the sauce and dredged the chicken in flour before frying. I deglazed the pan with the sauce after pouring out the excess oil from frying. Pour the sauce slowly because it will spatter at first. Pour the sauce over the chicken and bake. I did not add the vinegar, pepper or celery seeds; served it with blue cheese dressing and tater rounds. Celery sticks dipped in dressing rounded out the meal."
2209213,135585,3/19/2012,5,"I made this Sat nite because hubby was craving ""bar food"".  He said it's a keeper!  Followed recipe except celery salt.  I also doubled the sauce as others advised.  Frank's now has a ""thick"" version of their sauce and that's what I used.  Will definitely make again!"
2324285,135585,11/25/2012,4,"This is a good chicken breast recipe, but unfortunately the buffalo sauce doesn't cling to the chicken, so my buffalo chicken sandwiches tasted pretty bland.  I had to dip it in the sauce.  I think it would've tasted better just on the plate with the sauce over it.  Thanks for sharing."
293757,135585,12/5/2013,5,"I really enjoyed this recipe, so I will be making again only change I would do is doubling the sauce, but other than that it was yyuummmmyyy, thanks again for the fab post!!!!"
1098736,135585,7/3/2014,4,Followed previous suggestions and dredged the chicken alomg with this and it was AWESOME! thanks!
1862990,135585,9/16/2014,5,"I like *hot* to a small degree, so I actually used half hot sauce and half ketchup to tone down the heat, but the result was quite delicious ... this is a quick and easy recipe that my family really enjoyed. I&#039;ll definitely make it again!"
1803173435,135585,9/27/2014,5,"So, I made this and totally misread the instructions and ended up adding the salad dressing to the mix that was poured over the chicken!  I don&#039;t like Blue Cheese, so I used light Ranch.  The verdict....AMAZING...and not at all too thin.  I spooned it over some brown rice; it had a marsala or curry-like feel to the dish.  It definitely makes too much more sauce, but it was so good nonetheless.  I kept repeating to myself: &quot;I hope it doesn&#039;t burn&quot;.  Luckily, it didn&#039;t!"
2000719677,135585,12/6/2015,4,We didn&#039;t even bake them and they turned out great!
2000837459,135585,1/24/2016,5,This was delicious! I eat low carb high fat and this was the best. Even my family liked it.
2000870186,135585,2/11/2016,5,"I&#039;ve made this quite a few times now and it has become of a family favorite. I dredge the chicken breasts in flour (seasoned with a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder) and brown them. I also double the sauce...I use Frank&#039;s and don&#039;t add the celery seed. So good!!!"
310001,135585,8/12/2016,5,"I tried this today, minus the celery seed, added minced garlic. I only had thinly sliced, boneless, skinless chicken breast on hand, so used that. I loved it, and will try it again using different hot sauces (we have at least a dozen kinds in the pantry b/c of DH). DH enjoyed it, as well as my younger son (dipped in blue cheese of course). Thank you for an easy, delicious recipe. Perhaps I'll put thin slices of swiss or provolone on top of it next time, at the end, just long enough to melt but not burn."
2574795,135585,12/31/2016,3,"Good but I think these buffalo chicken breasts are better grilled - slightly brown on each side and then baste generously with sauce turning once or twice until cooked through. But, this is a good substitute for nights when firing up the grill would not be optimal. Made several tweaks. Also recommend keeping some sauce on the side for dipping."
2001382107,135585,2/7/2017,4,"I made this tonight but I put my own spin on it. I took someones advice from the reviews below and I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and pepper then drenched it in flour sauteed for a few min on each side in real butter. I put the chicken in a pan and covered it in a mix of buffalo sauce, ranch, and parmesan cheese. Topped it with monterey cheese (or mozarella) baked at 400 for 20min covered with foil. It was AMAZING! The whole family loved it! Not too spicy for the kids either. I didnt use celery seed or vinegar at all jist because i didnt have them in the pantry."
2001461276,135585,3/28/2017,0,"I've made this twice. Used Franks, a bit of Worcester and some red wine vinegar. Only 3 breasts, as this is for 2! Add a side of Mrs.Tt's Pierogies and a salad ... Great Meal! Will make again and may also change the ingredients! I love experimenting with flavors."
894666,135585,5/3/2017,5,"So easy and so quick to put together! Just pan-fried the flour/salt/peppper coated chicken in a T of butter. Mixed the sauce together (used ranch instead of blue cheese, didn't use the T of butter in sauce or the celery seed.) Drizzled a light coating of sauce on each side of chicken when it was almost done and let it cook another minute or so. That was it!! So easy!!!! Served it with butter noodles, salad and watermelon. So flavorful!"
51501,168848,3/7/2007,4,"These were sooooo easy and delicious! Chef#319903, you were right....these do go quickly!!"
651269,168848,6/22/2008,4,Great! Icing is delicious.
634323,168848,9/7/2008,5,These were really yummy & so fast to  make.  The most surprising part was the icing.  I have looked for a while for good tasting icings that don't have butter or shortening.  This is the best I have tried.
375987,174815,12/19/2006,5,really simple to make and delicious with caribbean style curries.
582561,187394,10/15/2012,3,"Didn't quite make the grade for me and DH.  The sauce seemed to be a bit too on the dry side (may be my tomatoes weren't big enough) and while I enjoy chilies, they didn't really work with the flavour combinations.  MAde for PaC Fall 2012."
540605,208916,2/27/2010,5,"These nachos were sexy! I added a can of black beans, rinsed, to add more color and because I love beans on nachos."
8688,231539,7/4/2007,5,"We love marinated cucumbers during the summertime, and this recipe is no exception.  This is a delicious and fresh tasting salad which goes well with any summertime meal.  Thanks for sharing, CulinaryQueen : )"
226066,231539,10/21/2007,5,Used an English cucumber and drained it for about an hour.  The cucumber was so crunchy and tasty!  Added about 1 tablespoon of sugar.  Lots of pepper.  Couldn't find fresh dill so used dried.  Thanks CulinaryQueen!
80353,231539,10/28/2007,5,"Very tasty and refreshing salad.  I only ended up using half the amount of sugar called for and it was sweet enough for our tastes.  The dill is a great addition, complementing the crispy-crunchy blandness of the cucumber.  Highly recommended."
486725,231539,12/30/2007,4,"I really liked the dill in this. I halved the vinegar and only used 1/4 tsp of the sugar, so it wouldn't be too sweet (both were still plenty for us). Served 4 as a main side vegetable dish."
963505,231539,10/15/2008,5,Nice refreshing salad! I used less than a half the sugar and came out great! Thank you!
738401,231539,6/7/2009,5,"Boy do we LOVE this at our house!  I have made it dozens of times with the following adjustments:  first, I do PEEL the cucumbers and slice them with a mandoline, second I let them sit about an hour in the salt to drain off maximum moisture.  Also,  I use dried dill.  This salad is super.  Thanks."
207176,235138,10/19/2007,0,"So glad you posted this!  I had ripped it from Bon Apetit magazine, July, 2007. I like the tip that says you can keep it warm in a fondue pot"
538524,235138,5/12/2008,5,"i wanted to make this for mothers day because we had the whole family over for a carne asada! and wow was this a hit! everybody thought it was amazing! we weren't able to find the poblano chiles at the store, but its okay cause some of my family can't handle spice very well. it was great without em and we all gobbled this allllll up! pretty easy to make too!!! great recipe!"
1675225,258142,4/19/2015,2,"I used thawed frozen flounder , and my fish turned out mushy, not crispy.  Didn&#039;t like the flavor either.  Won&#039;t use this recipe again."
375111,235138,11/28/2008,4,"I took this to a pre-holiday party and I thought it was very tasty...but the guys LOVED it!!!  Many raves from them.  It is a little time consuming, but not hard.  Just make sure to give yoourself plenty of time to get all the different items prepped first, it would have been a little less stressful if I had done that:)  I also put it in a fondue pot to keep warm-thanks for the tip!"
571739,235138,8/8/2010,4,"If I could I'd probably give this 3.5 stars as written, but my husband loved it so I bumped it up.  I made a half batch and it was about and inch deep in a standard pie plate to give you an idea of quantity.  I was expecting better flavor but I found it lacking.  I think I'll make it again but instead of the mozzarella I'd use a stronger flavored cheese...not sure what yet but it was a little bland.  I think I'll also use a full flavored Mexican beer instead of the chicken stock as well.  I popped it under the broiler for a few minutes to get it good and bubbly, but it still firmed up quickly and was difficult to eat after 15 minutes, so I'll use my fondue pot next time to keep it warm."
356062,243579,9/1/2007,5,"I loooooove garlic, so this recipe was great for me since I used a garlic pesto and used a few cloves of roasted garlic mixed into the final product. Excellent fast and tasty side!"
293410,243579,9/9/2007,5,"Really glad I chose this for tag! I used my Winter Pesto which has tons of parsley, so didn't need to add any more. I bet it would be amazing with basil pesto. Next time I think I'll use more than 1 clove (garlic fiend here *sigh*). This is a terrific basic recipe that is open to variations. Thanks for posting!"
470351,243579,9/20/2008,4,"This was really tasty...but I was the only one in the family who liked it.  I didn't use homemade pesto since we're recovering from Hurricane Ike and my frozen batch of pesto melted during the power outage.  used Trader Joe's brand and while I enjoyed it, I will try it again with homemade.  I Love cannellini beans, garlic and onions.  This was a nice side dish for me.  Thank you!"
96177,243579,1/10/2009,5,"Great cannellini recipe. I used my frozen home grown cannellini's from last summer's garden and served it cold for lunch. Nice blend of flavors, love pesto and garlic and beans. I added the leftovers to recipe #348260. tagged in 123."
58931,243579,5/1/2009,5,"I made these with what I had on had, which was Great Northern beans and no parsley.  In a word: fabulous.  Thank you!"
2674680,243579,3/2/2014,4,This was very fast and easy to make. I sauteed a chopped shallot instead of the onion and used 3 garlic cloves. Didn&#039;t have any parsley. I toasted some crusty bread and then slathered the bean mix on top of it and ate it as an open-faced sandwich.
2000322630,243579,2/5/2017,4,"Like another reviewer, I used Great Northern beans and no parsley. It was very tasty and easy to make! I used store bought pesto."
131674,250973,10/22/2007,5,These were rich and fudgy.  I baked them for 25 minutes and they came out perfect.  I sprinkled the half the top with walnuts and left the other half plain.
305531,250973,12/23/2007,5,"Wonderful! I'm not a baker at all and these were so simple and easy even for me, lol. They are so rich, moist, and fudgy. Yum. I added walnuts and my family devoured these. Thanks Lynn for making me look so good."
52282,250973,12/27/2007,3,"next time i will make these in 2 8x8"" pand so they cook through. my oven might be off, but i had to bake for 35 minutes and the center was still totally wet.
you didn't mention cooking temp, so i checked my basic ""how to cook everything"" cookbook by mark bittman who had this exact recipe in half and recommended 350."
50969,250973,1/31/2008,4,"I made these on 1/31/08 for ""Comfort Food Photos 2008"" .The taste was good,but not as fudgy as I would have liked.And I don't know if baking them at 25 minutes instead of 20 had anything to do with them being dry.But thanks for posting,and ""Keep Smiling :)"""
37636,250973,4/27/2008,4,Very good brownies!!! I baked mine for 25 minutes as you suggested might be a good time to check again. They came out a cross between chewy and cakelike brownies which might please everyone regardless of preference. I put finely chopped pecans in mine. They won't last long here!!! Thanks for the recipe. ~Lorie
56003,250973,1/17/2010,4,"Very good brownies, Lynn.  I cut the recipe in half and baked for 20 minutes in a disposable brownie pan.  Came out nice and moist, just like I like them.  Thnx for sharing!  Made for Comfort Cafe Snow Queen Chalet Jan 2010."
2549237,250973,5/9/2014,5,"These were very good.  I made 20 batches to take to a bake sale at my kid&#039;s school in my Perfect Brownie Pan and they were all gone within about 15 minutes.  I had three ladies come and ask me for the recipe and I emailed this pages link when I got home, so hopefully you will be getting a bunch more reviews.  These were definitely very fudgy and delicious.  I can see this being whipped up quite often when we want a chocolate fix as they were simple and delicious.  Thank you so much Lavender Lynn.  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
299849,342432,4/18/2009,4,"Very tasty.  The tortillas turned to mush in the oven though and I don't know why.  I wonder if I didn't cook them long enough (in the Pam) or if I could have tried some crunchy chips instead.  

What a great recipe to use up rotisserie chicken!!!!!  I will try cooking the tortillas longer next time."
107135,423430,6/22/2010,5,ok this is really good  sorry i havent gotten around to reviewing you lol  nice dish   zingo tour 6 i used my greek spice recipe for this
498271,423430,6/22/2010,5,"Boy this was really good!  I don't care for onions so left them out, and left out the feta to keep the calories down a bit.  I love Cavenders - who knew it would taste so great in eggs?!  This makes a great breakfast that I will definitely make again - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT6, Zwizzle Chicks"
80353,423430,6/23/2010,5,"Took a bit of licence with this recipe - used full-fat feta and regular tomatoes, which I didn't feel compromised the recipe any.  I don't know what Cavender's greek seasoning is, so I just used a pinch each of oregano and basil (a little more generous on the oregano) as well as salt and pepper.  The kids and I really enjoyed this wrap for our breakfast - tasty and filling and fast.  Thanks."
28177,423430,6/27/2010,5,"I guessed that the black olives were Greek Kalamata, which I had on hand, so I used those.  DS & I looked everywhere for the Cavenders A/P Greek Seasoning without any luck.  Never heard of the brand even, so maybe something we don't get in this area.  We settled on a seasoning mix that had a great many traditional Greek herbs in it.  Other than that, made as directed.  Even my kalamata-hating family enjoyed them in this wrap.  I loved that it was mostly vegetables and we didn't miss the breakfast sausage because it was so flavorful.  Thanks for sharing your creation, Shuz!  Made & enjoyed for ZWT-6 Team Xtra Hot Dishes! :D"
228458,423430,6/27/2010,5,"Mmmm, this made for such a delicious lunch! I used green onions because I had them on hand, and only one egg for my wrap. I loved the crunch of the veggies with the soft egg and smooth cheese...yum! I might have gone a bit light on the Cavender's (didn't really measure as I was cooking for one) so next time I'll be sure to use it all! Thanks for posting! Made for ZWT 6, Team Mischief Makers."
56003,423430,6/27/2010,5,"What a great b'fast this made!  I had some beautiful Whole Wheat & Flax low-fat wrappers I had gotten at the store some time ago.  I guess I was just waiting to use them with this recipe.  Thnx so much for sharing your recipe, Shuzbud.  Made for the Voracious Vagabonds of ZWT 6."
171790,423430,6/28/2010,5,Yummy. I'm having one of these for my lunch as I type. Like a previous reviewer I used whole wheat & flax tortillas. I had to leave out the zucchini since I didn't have any and I used campari tomatoes which are a little larger than cherry tomatoes. I also used a different brand of Greek seasoning and green olives rather than black since that's what we usually have on hand (family prefers green over black olives). Made for ZWT6 ZINGO
192581,423430,6/30/2010,5,"Great recipe.  I used an improvised Greek seasoning mix, using garlic, oregano, lemon, basil, black pepper, etc.  Egg to veggie ratio was just perfect.  I used about 1/4 cup feta cheese for the whole recipe, and kalamata olives.  We ate this as a main veggie meal with a veggie side.  Next time, I might make sure to try to make this warmer, by warming the tortillas.   Either way, a definite keeper and make again meal!  We were both pleased!  Thanks so much :)"
527607,423430,7/1/2010,5,"Had these when a friend and her daughter were over, they were a big hit!"
428885,423430,7/2/2010,5,"Shuz, a perfect taste for a Sunday morning on the farm. Loved the greek seasoning coupled with the eggs and the tortilla. I warmed my tortilla and the eggs almost melted into the tortilla it was so good!! made for ZWT 6"
169430,423430,10/19/2010,5,"You really have a winner here. I made it using Recipe#81283 (which is fabulous) and using the feta. It's a wonderful flavor experience and made a perfect lunch. I see that some reviewers have mentioned warming the tortillas, I always warm them for a few seconds in the microwave because they are so much more compliant about being wrapped. I used kalamata olives and what else can I say except Yumm!"
424680,423430,1/16/2012,5,"Followed your recipe right on down (my other half wouldn't have let me omit the feta!), & filled 4 tortillas right up for a very delicious wrap! No need for warming the soft tortillas I use as they are ALWAYS soft, but maybe that's also because we go through so many of 'em! Wonderful recipe! [Made & reviewed in the current ADOPT A TAG event]"
2001327157,423430,12/29/2016,5,"No Greek seasoning at my supermarket, so used 1 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt. Also added about 1/4 cup fresh parsley. Amazing flavor! Adding to the dinner rotation."
2876642,512630,11/17/2014,5,Really simple and delicious!  I use this recipe whenever I don&#039;t feel like doing much work for vegetables -and it&#039;s still very yummy!
2177426,512630,2/3/2018,5,"So simple and so good! I used pink salt, just because....LOL. The temp. and timing are perfect. Thank you Martha"
2708004,514512,3/21/2014,5,EVERYONE loved this salad!  It was so easy and so different.  I will definitely be making this again (and again!).
646967,688,6/9/2008,3,These are easy to make however they never set up so we could eat them!  They tasted great but had to be eaten with a fork!  I am wondering if you need to let it boil before removing from heat so they will harden -?-
574031,688,8/10/2010,5,"This is a fabulous recipe!  I had a hard time getting them to not fall apart when dropping them, so the second time I put it into a cake pan and chilled.  Everyone loved these cookies/bars."
18660,12572,11/2/2001,5,"The combination of crescent rolls and savory chicken filling was delicious. If you ever want to jazz up a chicken salad sandwich, this filling would go well on any type of bread. The ingredients blend well together. I used low fat canned chcicken as a time saver and reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls to save on calories. Would go well with a salad."
23139,12572,1/23/2002,0,"My grandmother used to make these! I use her recipe which is the same except no olives. She used to also use tuna sometimes instead of chicken, omit the salt if you do use tuna. I sometimes use different flavored croutons..such as ranch,or garlic and onion-gives it a little kick."
37215,12572,4/12/2002,5,"These were delicious and dissappeared quickly.  I used about 1/3 cup of mushrooms instead of the olives.  I had quite alot of filling left though  so I made some pastry, cut into rounds, spooned on the mixture, folded in half and crimped the edges with a fork. They turned out great too!"
30298,12572,8/27/2002,4,"This was good!  My husband loved it.  I added more onions than were called for, and will probably take Clarebears advice for added mushrooms next time, just to give it a little something extra.  I used reduced fat rolls and light cream cheese as well, and do not think this detracted from a great meal!"
49126,12572,10/26/2002,5,"I tried this one with fat free cream cheese, pre-made biscuit dough, celery, mushrooms, onions, and chicken.  Delicious!  Thanks for an easy alternative to a box dinner.  Leftovers kept well, and were great nuked! "
65765,12572,12/28/2002,5,"I LOVE chicken squares!  They are my favorite dish!  I boil the chicken and then put it in the food processor with the cream cheese, butter, and chives.  It's a creamier consistency than if you cut up the chicken.  And then pour some cream of mushroom soup over the top of it, MMM.  You will LOVE this stuff!  Chicken rice is a good side dish to serve with it too.  Also, I find that it is just as tasty if you use low-fat cream cheese and low-fat crescent rolls.  However, if you use the low-fat crescent rolls, be sure to grease the pan!"
58407,12572,4/16/2003,4,"I love these! I have this same exact recipe, but I add one tablespoon of pimento to the chicken filling."
86627,12572,8/25/2003,5,"My kids loved these! That says alot.  My oldest kept raving about them...even hubby said.. you know... you could use same concept and make pizza or hamburger ""hot-pockets""... Thanks for posting. We'll make these again and will play with the fillings for variety."
56181,12572,11/10/2003,5,"These are so easy and good!  I made them a little different by pressing 4 of the crescent rolls into the bottom of a greased 8x8 pan, putting the fillling on top, and then putting the remaining 4 crescent on top of that, and finally sprinkling the croutons(about 1/2 cup) over it!  Hubby and I both loved these!  Thanks for the great recipe, Lauren!  Will definitely be making these again!"
50411,12572,1/22/2004,5,"Excellent!! The only change I made was using garlic butter in place of regular butter, and they were superb!!  My 6 year old son snarfed his down, and he doesn't even like cream cheese, so that just shows how well all the flavors in the filling blend together.  Very simple, very tasty, and will be made time and time again in our house. Thanks for sharing. "
117776,12572,3/15/2004,5,"These were a big hit with my kids!  There was plenty of filling so I used 2 pkgs of rolls.  I also just folded them over to make squares instead of pulling up the corners.  They were like hot pockets.  Of course I had to omit the olives so my kids would even try them. I'll be making these again, thanks!!"
27744,12572,3/16/2004,5,"I really loved this.  I did make a few changes...chopped fresh mushrooms instead of olives, half-n-half instead of milk and I added a little fresh parmesan.  The family loved it.  It'll be in the rotation from now on. Thanks!"
60992,12572,4/12/2004,5,What a great way to use leftover poultry! I used turkey and per the other review added 1 T. diced roasted red pepper. I couldn't resist adding 1/4 c. shredded sharp cheddar (but next time I will add more)to the filling mixture. The packets go together beautifully and the buttery crushed croutons on top and a great flavor dimension to the recipe. My husband adored them and so did I.
250238,12572,2/18/2007,4,These were rather plain.  I think some addition of red pepper or spice of some kind may have gone a long way in helping them out.  The pastry/crust was perfect.  They just need some tweaking to the filling.  Don't be scared to try them...just do your best to kick them up a notch!
55729,12572,4/17/2004,5,"This wasn't the exact recipe I was looking for, but I think I can comfortably stop looking. It was easy and yummy, and I had 0 complaints. I didn't have any croutons so I used bread crumbs instead, and 3/4 c. would certainly have been overkill - I only used about 2 T, and I think I'll skip it next time, but will still brush with butter. I used 4oz cream cheese, and didn't add olives."
180037,12572,1/5/2005,5,"I have been making this recipe since it won the 1974 Pillsbury Bake-off.  My family insists that no Thanksgiving weekend in our house is complete without using some leftover turkey to make this dish!  Usually I stick to the basic recipe (at the insistance of my family) but I recently had some mild goat cheese that I wanted to use up.  I mixed it with a little chutney and the chicken as the filling.  With some additional chutney on the side, it was quite tasty."
98165,12572,2/10/2005,5,Thsee are excellant and so easy. My family loves these and are always so excited when they see me making them.  Thanks again!
104472,12572,5/9/2005,5,This recipe is great. I used crushed ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs to make it more kid friendly so my boys would eat it. My dh isalways impressed with this meal - A+
37449,12572,7/31/2005,5,"I made this for my husband for dinner tonight and he loved it! I left out the olives, and used scallions. Thanks for an easy meal!"
68884,12572,9/12/2005,5,"Wow, I got raves when I served these to friends for a casual dinner . I tripled the recipe to make 12 bundles and added 2 cloves of garlic and about a cup of shredded cheddar. I didn't use the full amount of crushed croutons - I don't know why, but it didn't 'stick' to the bundles like I thought. These would be so versatile to get some veggies in - finely chopped celery & carrots or mushrooms & broccoli would go great in these. I used light cream cheese and light crescent rolls with no compromise to the taste. Thanks :) "
72243,12572,9/13/2005,5,"This is a wonderful recipe.  Every time I visit my mother, she requests I make these for her!!"
31499,12572,9/16/2005,5,"Super easy recipe that makes a nice presentation, and tastes just great. I brushed the tops with EVOO instead of butter, but otherwise followed this exactly. Really different recipe that I will definately make again."
120843,12572,9/19/2005,5,"Very good!  My 5 y/o nephew and I made these Saturday night and he gave them a ""thumbs up""  I did ""divide"" the mixture and add some canned artichokes to my half~I used Bratty's advice and brushed the tops with olive oil & Michelle's advice and added 1/4 C. shredded cheese-the results were perfect. Thanks for sharing!"
51011,12572,9/24/2005,5,"Easy and quick to put together!  I used 2 oz of cream cheese, green onions, and 1/4 a cup of cheddar cheese along with all the other ingredients.  I also forgot about putting the toping on, but the top was still golden and crunchy.  Thanks so much for sharing!"
103876,12572,9/25/2005,5,I made this recipe for lunch today because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I thought it was really good and my family enjoyed it too.  I used light cream cheese and only 1 tablespoon of butter.  The croutons added a nice crunch.
64583,12572,1/19/2006,4,These were good and the leftovers reheated very well in the oven the next day.  
177933,12572,2/14/2006,5,These were so easy and yummy.  My husband loved them.  I added a handful of peas.  Thanks!!
39301,12572,10/14/2006,5,"Easy, flavorful and inexpensive...  A triple threat!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.  Will definitely make it again.  I omitted the olives as a matter of personal taste, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The filling possibilities are endless, though!"
183798,12572,12/14/2006,5,"This was so good!  It looked like it came out a box (it was that perfect) and tasted like I slaved in the kitchen all day!!!  I made it with fresh boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  Thanks so much for this delish recipe.  Next time I might add some mushrooms (and believe me, there will be a next time and a next time - MANY more times!!! LOL)"
425105,12572,1/8/2007,5,"I got this same recipe from a good friend years ago. It's always wonderful. Her recipe called for optional pimento instead of olives, but I always left that out because I don't care for it. Her recipe also uses chives instead of onions. I usually use bread crumbs instead of croutons. I've also made this with the lowfat crescent rolls, and it comes out just as good."
418071,12572,1/23/2007,5,"I got this recipe off of the pillsbury site, and it was absolutely amazing.  It was easy and looked like it took hours to make in the kitchen."
111291,12572,3/23/2007,5,"A five star recipe.  Found this while I was ""surfing"" RecipeZaar. Thought if I didn't find it, I'd post it. This has been a ""regular"" in my home for years.  My recipe omits the olives and croutons.  Great served with a side of carrots and peas.  Thanks for sharing!!"
461156,12572,3/23/2007,5,These are perfect. Only thing I added  was garlic salt. My picky 6 year old said this is her favorite now! Thank you!!
357723,12572,3/25/2007,5,"These were fabulous. I made them exactly as directed and doubled the recipe. The only thing different is that I added garlic. VERY delicious, easy to make. Thank you Lali!"
173314,12572,3/26/2007,5,These have always been a favorite of mine and often serve when having a friend over for lunch...everyone loves this!
171790,12572,5/9/2007,5,These are really good. I first made them back in the 70's when my MIL and I found the recipe in a magazine.
480441,12572,5/9/2007,5,"wasn't real sure as I was preparing these,but to my surprise they were absolutely delicious....I'll definitely will make these again..thanks"
315055,12572,5/18/2007,4,"Looked really nice put together and perfect size for to take to lunch, but the filling was a little bland"
452210,12572,6/23/2007,3,"These were really good. I had a pretty hard time getting the first few to close up, but I got the hang of it. I gave up on trying to do the small version, but I manage a little better with the larger version. Very yummy!"
501437,12572,6/28/2007,5,"My family loved these! I left out olives, and added a little bit of shredded cheddar and it was a hit. These reheat surpsisingly well also."
166294,12572,9/4/2007,5,"We really enjoyed these.  It was like warm chicken salad in a pastry.  Yum!  My kids wanted more than I actually made.  Gotta love when that happens.  I even got the comment, ""Mom, you're such a good cooker.""  Thanks for posting!"
407007,12572,9/26/2007,5,"if I could give you 50 stars, I would -- this was absolutely wonderful!!! my house smelled so delish while these cooked and the taste did not disappoint! would not change a thing. perfect recipe. thanks for sharing it!"
363962,12572,11/16/2007,5,"This is pretty good, and easy to make, next time i 'm going to take one of reviewers suggestion and make mini size ones for an appetizer, Thanks for recipe Lali."
375111,12572,11/26/2007,5,I made the appetizer version of these for a cocktail party and they were great!  I followed another reviewer and used 1/3 less fat crm. cheese and it tasted just fine that way.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the deli since I was short on cooking time and I can't stand canned chicken and I think that added to the flavor a lot!  I omitted the olives since I din't have any and added 1 can mushroom pieces b/c I did have that.  Made into small squares and brushed with butter and sprinkled on seasoned bread crumbs.  Love them!  Thanks so much!!
672478,12572,6/25/2008,5,"I made these for a get-together and everyone loved these.  I didn't have any left over.  It did make six squares, thankfully I had two cans of crescent rolls. I'll increase the ingredients very sligthtly so that I can make 8 (for 2 cans of crescent rolls). I didn't add the olive and I also didn't used crushed croutons on the top, I didn't think it would need it.  Definitely a keeper!"
170064,12572,8/6/2008,3,We love cream cheese appetizers but we found these to be a little bland.  I didn't include the olives which may have helped.  We thought they may be better if they were a little bit smaller.
917501,12572,8/11/2008,5,"These are absolutely delicious! I omitted the olives (since we don't like them) and substituted green onions instead. I also threw in some frozen peas. These are terrific, and easy to make."
696386,12572,8/26/2008,5,I admit I was a little scared of these but I made them for a party and everyone LOVED them. I followed the recipe exactly (which was very simple) and made them a couple hours before a party. They stayed tasty through the entire night. I ended up using the crutons inside the squares because it seemed easier and that worked too. yum!
968749,12572,10/20/2008,4,I made these last night for dinner.  I actually made 2 batches - one as directed and the other with cheddar cheese instead of cream cheese for my DH who is not a fan of cream cheese.  I think I liked the one with cheddar better.  DH liked them and liked the fact that the bread was flakey and light.  I served with fried potatoes but I should have served with something else because the color palet was terrible...  golden brown with golden brown! Will probably make these again.
837995,12572,10/24/2008,5,Great appetizer for a party!  We loved them and will make for my party that is coming up.  I am sure they will go over real well!
715957,12572,12/31/2008,5,"These are my daughters' favorite!  I have to double the recipe, they eat so many of them.  I have sent leftovers for lunch, too.  Sometimes I substitute roasted red pepper for the olives.  Yum!"
371146,24554,1/26/2007,5,These are the BEST mashed potatoes ever!!  I could eat the whole pot by myself!
204177,12572,3/12/2009,5,"A great receipe, we substituted more onion instead of the olives and added about 1 ounce more cream cheese, it turned out great.  The wife and kid loved them."
622972,12572,3/22/2009,4,"I used to make this back when we were newly weds, and lost the recipe.  This was very similar, but not exact.  I leave out the olives, and the croutons.  Good with a side salad."
874900,12572,4/3/2009,4,Husband loved this.  I thought it was okay.  I made it in an 8x8 pan like another reviewer suggested since I am always short on time.  Left out olives and added sauteed mushrooms.  He wants me to make again but I will wait about a month or so.  It was an easy dish to prepare so I will make again.
1231301,12572,4/8/2009,4,"You can save calories by using reduced fat crescent rolls and omitting the butter and croutons, add veggies by adding 1.5 cups each of steamed broccoli and cut corn, and save time if you use Onion and Chive flavored cream cheese instead of dicing onions. This is a great go-to meal if you're short on time, or patience, or ideas! YUM!"
517533,12572,5/7/2009,5,"These were so good! I used the reduced fat crescent rolls, cut out the butter and croutons and added peas. I also topped with cheese in the last minutes of cooking and it was so delicious! i served it with stuffing and a gravy made in the same pan as the chicken, with a little flour, butter (roux if you will), chicken broth, and ff milk. SO GOOD!"
527375,12572,8/8/2009,5,sooo good i used green onions
951589,12572,9/19/2009,5,"I've made these twice now, and my husband is now requesting them weekly!  These are AMAZING!  I use the reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls, and leave out the olives and chopped onion, and just throw in some onion powder. I stick a pot of water on the stove and heat to boiling, while I dice up chicken breasts.  I cook the chicken in the boiling water (covered) with chicken seasoning. It usually takes about 3-5 minutes.  By accident, I left out the milk the second time, and didn't notice a difference!  I also sprinkled the squares with grated parmesan cheese instead of the croutons...that was DELICIOUS!  Mine are usually done in about 18 minutes.  To reheat leftovers, I put them back in the oven at 250*...much better than becoming mushy in the microwave.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that I will keep in my ""go-to"" recipes! :)"
876090,12572,9/22/2009,5,"My Bride and I agree with all the positive reviews. Very easy and very satisfying. Next time I am going to use Tuna in place of the Chicken. Also, the Mushroom idea sounds good.
Thanks for the recipe.
C/J"
81522,12572,10/9/2009,5,"I've made this recipe several times already but have never remembered to rate it.  It's fast, easy, and DELISH!!!  Pillsbury now makes crescent sheets, which makes this so much more easier to prepare.  It's become a favorite in my home!!! Thanks for sharing...."
714171,12572,3/31/2010,5,"My mom used to make this when I was a kid, and making it for myself now did not disappoint! I used italian bread crumbs on the top. My kids loved it-- I think I might sneak some mixed veggies in there next time."
1191030,12572,5/23/2010,5,"I really liked this. I didn't have any crescent rolls so I just made it like a casserole and it turned out really well! I did add some fresh minced garlic and included green olives. It was a little bit different but in a good way. I thought of serving it over pasta and I think that I'll do that next time if I'm once again out of crescent rolls. I also used garlic cheese croutons and loved them as the topping! At any rate, it's creamy, comforting, and very easy! Thank you so much! :)"
355637,12572,11/28/2010,4,Yummm!!
1045865,12572,12/19/2010,5,Delicious!   Easy and quick to make.
235355,12572,2/7/2011,4,Very tasty and easy to make.  Mine may have been a bit more soft than they should have because I put them in covered containers soon after coming out of the oven so I could take them to the superbowl party.  Despite this they were a definite hit at the party.  Thanks for a great recipe!
717914,12572,12/22/2011,4,Doubled recipe and left out the olives. All of us enjoyed this recipe for something differant.
1294683,12572,7/7/2012,5,These were super good and easy!  I used green onions and substitued a handful of peas for the olives.  I used cheese and garlic croutons.  I doubled the recipe and the filling was exactly enough for 8 pockets (2 cans of crescents).  Good thing because my teenage son kept going back for more. Thanks for a delicious recipe that looks gourmet! My pic is the two pockets on a white plate next to a salad.   :)
2615281,12572,1/5/2013,4,"VERY YUMMY! :-) me and my mom tripled the recipe and made outside out of little squares we made out of crescent dough sheets. We're taking them to a party, and i'm sure they'll be a hit!"
2604118,12572,1/6/2013,4,Yummy! I used shredded BBQ chicken and panko bread crumbs in place of the croutons. Will make again.
1028382,12572,7/9/2013,5,"My husband and I loved them! Sprinkled some Italian bread crumbs instead of the croutons, otherwise as directed.  My 6 year old complained but ate it, but that&#039;s normal about anything new.  Quick to throw together too!"
1800148278,12572,10/23/2013,5,I tasted the meat mixture before folding them into the crescent envelopes. I used the &quot;triangle&quot; portions to feed a large number of my husbands firefighter co-workers. While I haven&#039;t yet tasted the entire ensemble... they look just stunning!!!! So I&#039;m going to go ahead and give it a five star rating. Because the meat mixture was scrummy-nummy-yummy. I loaded a picture of my minis. Are they beautiful! I hope the firemen are happy.
2001116026,12572,8/5/2016,0,"This is a popular standard in our house. A few tweaks if they inspire anyone- I roast chicken tenders with a rotisserie chicken seasoning and pour the roasting juices into the mix. I also add sour cream instead of butter, 1/2 a packet of powdered ranch dip mix, grated onion (1 tbsp as recipe indicates), 1/2 cup finely grated parmesan and some fresh chopped parsley. I will also sub in the chopped green part of the scallion (2 tbsp) in place of the onion for some freshness if I have them on hand."
23333,16809,5/13/2002,5,"This was extremely tasty!  I used honey ham and low fat swiss cheese. I also reduced the butter and added some fresh black pepper.  Served this with white and wild rice mixture (plain) and some baby carrots.  A delicious dinner that I will make again and again!
-Christina"
28995,16809,6/8/2002,3,I must have had the heat too hight?  The sauce came out really thick and it seemed it could use more liquid.  This is the first time I tried the recipe and I had problems with the chicken too - when I pounded it out - it broke apart?  Any suggestions would be great!  But all in all it was that bad - just the cook and her preparation I guess lol!
6512,16809,1/30/2003,5,I had some left over ham and needed a recipe to use it up and am so glad I found this one!!!! This was delicous!!!!! I added 1/2 cup of white wine to the sauce. I like lots of sauce and next time I will double the sauce. 
70845,16809,2/5/2003,3,"Overall, this was a tasty recipe. The sauce did turn out really thick and most of the cheese melted out of the chicken while cooking, so I'll make some adjustments for next time. "
58229,16809,10/1/2004,5,this was sooo good.  everyone raved about this recipe.  decided not to make the sauce and used another recipe for bernaise sauce instead and cooked the chicken in olive oil. it turned out fabulous.  my husband made a sandwhich for lunch the next day out of the leftovers.  thanks for the great recipe.  
291378,16809,9/21/2006,4,"This was very good.  When I used to make it, I didn't know to flatten the breasts, and it really makes a difference.  I had to cook it much longer than suggested to get the centers done, and ended up cutting one in half to finish the center-but once I did that it took less than a minute to cook up.  The sauce was nice and thick and tasty."
186802,16809,12/30/2006,5,"This was incredibly easy!  The only thing I didn't add was the parsley... I didn't have any on hand.  Other than that, I made it like stated, though I think mine looks more folded over than rolled.  It worked in any case.  Thanks for the delicious chicken cordon bleu recipe! :)"
663171,16809,1/13/2009,4,this was good. i didn't care for the sauce and maybe it was just because my chicken breasts were on the lager side but i had to bake mine (just 350 cover w/foil for about 15 min w/a few splashes on chkn broth) after browning so i didn't burn it and made sure in was dine through. thanks for the recipe!
6512,29269,5/31/2002,5,"I  knew this would be good since it was from Inez!!! The sauce was so supurb we could not stop licking our fingers and even the bowl!!!!!!! I only had 4 pounds of ribs so I only made 1/2 of the sauce. My grill has very uneven heat and not dependable, so I cooked the ribs in the oven on 350 with an inch of water for 1 1/2 hours and then basted and put on the grill. This will be a summer favorite!!!!!! Next time I may try this  on chicken."
35729,29269,6/2/2002,5,"Thank you for a great tasting BBQ sauce, but I did change just one thing, I used just 1 tblsp. of the chili powder instead of 2, hubby can't take too much heat! He loved it, so this will be used quite a bit this summer not only on the spareribs, but chicken too!"
229236,29269,7/8/2006,5,"I also used 1 tbsp. chili powder instead of 2.  This is an absolutely delicious sauce.  I used it on beef ribs and pork ribs, grilled over a slower heat for about 1.5 hours.  "
572998,29269,5/18/2009,4,"The sauce for this recipe is pretty good, but the tomato taste was a bit strong and had me thinking pasta instead of ribs at times. I used baby back ribs cooked on the grill using low (~200degrees) indirect heat for a little over two hours."
424680,41230,11/13/2008,5,"Although I followed the recipe pretty much, I did cut back the amount of red chile by about 2/3! I also used the more moist, chewy Medjool dates & came up with A GREAT TASTING CHUTNEY, & one I'll make again! Thanks for adding to my growing number of chutney recipes! [Tagged, made & reviewed as part of my Chutney theme in My-3-Chefs]"
53002,117187,3/31/2011,5,"I don't cook this type of food often, but I am a Texas girl and my family loves comfort food...and this recipe went over well at our dinner table tonight. I made it as directed and it turned out great! I will be making this again. Thank you for posting. Rachel Castle"
65197,139213,10/5/2005,5,"I used one jalapeno chopped fine and sauted the tomatoes with the onion and pepper!!
YUMMY!!  DH thought I'd lost my mind...getting up to make breakfast before work..but soon realized it was worth my effort!!
Thanks!!"
169969,139213,10/7/2005,5,This was a perfect breakfast! I used 2 roma tomatoes and left them as round thin slices (instead of chopping). Beautiful eggs! Thanks Bethie!
56112,139213,6/23/2006,5,I am sitting here eating the most wonderful breakfast!!!  I used red onion and bell pepper because I didn't have any other kind.  Can't wait to give this a try with the Serrano.
223979,139213,7/14/2006,5,This was a really great lunch today!  I used tomatoes and a pepper from my garden.  And I served it with refried beans .  Great recipe!
131126,139213,7/16/2006,5,I subbed green pepper & a seeded jalapeno for the hotter peppers.  We really enjoyed our breakfast. Thanks elmotoo! 
175492,139213,9/9/2006,5,"I made this for our breakfast this morning, but used Pablano Peppers instead of serrano (my serrano plant simply isn't producing heavy enough yet).  Wow, what a really tasty treat to start the day with!!!  Thank You Bethie for sharing a great breakfast with us."
269891,139213,6/1/2007,5,Yum! I used jalapeno pepper(it was what I had on hand).
80353,139213,6/20/2007,5,Nice and spicy breakfast eggs.  I used a hot banana pepper instead of the serrano (can't get them here) and scaled this down for just me.
58104,139213,6/21/2007,5,"I made these again using jalapeno butter in place of the oil making a serving for one. thanks again.
 First reviewed Tuesday, October 04, 2005 Enjoyed these eggs with salsa recipe # 121276. I used cherry peppers from the garden. Cut the recipe for 1 and was still nice and filling. My tummy thanks you!"
430471,139213,6/26/2007,5,This was great. I used fresh garden cherry tomatoes and sweet onion which blended well with the pepper. I used egg beaters instead of eggs and added a little cheese.  I served with warmed tortillas. Yummy low cal low fat breakfast.
149363,139213,7/8/2007,5,"Simple and delicious, just as I knew it would be. I also added about a 1/4 of a jalepeno just for fun. Thanks for posting! Made for ZWT 3 :)"
701312,139213,12/23/2007,5,Outstanding!
223854,139213,2/2/2008,5,"Made this for Sunday Brunch with fresh eggs that a chicken kindly laid for friends of ours.  I made this two different ways, one with green peppers for Hubby and one without for Little Miss (DD), they both enjoyed them.  I didn't eat any because I don't eat eggs but their plates were empty in a flash.  Served them with butter toast and garnished with fresh parsley.  Thank you Elmotoo."
284897,139213,6/1/2008,5,"I doesn't get any quicker, easier or tastier than this recipe. A great recipe that satisfied my DD and DH for a quick lunch. I followed the exact recipe and served it on warm toast and they both loved it. A great simple and tasty recipe. Thanks Elmotoo. I am sure this recipe will be requested again soon! Made for Recipe Swap # 17. June 2008."
464080,139213,10/8/2008,5,"I used a scoop of green chilis instead of the serrano (availability issues in the midwestern US). I served this on top of corn tortillas that I turned into tostadas in the oven and topped with olives, a bit of cheese and a dollop of sour cream. Great breakfast. Made for Veg*n Swap 3."
37449,139213,12/4/2008,5,What a yummy breakfast I had this morning! I opted to fry the egg and put on top of the fried onions and tomatoes. So good! Thanks!
96177,139213,1/3/2009,4,very good. made for the vegetarian swap in.
416758,139213,2/6/2009,5,YUMMY! I cannot tell you how good this was. Served on top of a thick slice of toasted slightly garlicy french bread with cheese in between!
39835,139213,5/16/2009,5,Delish! I made this for the morning of my son's college graduation and he loved it! I doubled everything with no problems to served with fruit salad and rolls -- wonderful breakfast on his special day! Mde for Zaar World Tour 5/Mexico. Thanks for sharing!
465911,139213,7/17/2009,5,Very simple and tastes great. I had it for lunch with toast.
542159,139213,8/19/2009,5,"Very tasty. Made and rolled in a tortilla yumm. Simple and easy, you can't go wrong. Thanks for the post."
192581,139213,1/6/2010,5,"Easy and really delicious!  It was my first time using a serrano pepper, and while I was chopping it up it caused me to cough and sputter so much that I got nervous about using a whole one.  So I used a half, and was disappointed that the eggs lacked the heat that I had hoped :(  Oh well, next time I make this I'll definitely use at least 1 1/2 peppers.  My only change to this was to reduce the butter and oil.  I served it in a tortilla with cheese and yogurt on the side.  BF and I both loved it, but wanted more heat.  Will know next time."
1599919,139213,5/31/2011,5,Made this for breakfast this morning...so easy to make and so good!  I really enjoyed the flavour from sauteing the onions and pepper.<br/><br/>I omitted the butter; added black pepper; added cilantro and made an omelette out of it.<br/><br/>I'll make it again.
174096,139213,6/11/2011,5,"Easy and delicious, and very filling too!  I served with cheese-filled pupusas (Recipe #457123).  Thanks for sharing!  Veg*n Swap 35"
653438,139213,3/12/2012,5,Made for Recipe Swap#62 March 2012 AUS/NZ for our breakfast this weekend and we really enjoyed them.  I followed the instructions and put them on flour tortillas served with fresh salsa and some guacamole...Yummy.  Thanks for submitting the recipe.
471300,139213,8/5/2012,5,There is something wonderful about the combination of eggs and tomatoes.  This recipe is great and easy.  It was quick dinner with some nice bread when there was a sudden change of plans for the night.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for ZWT 8.
323186,139213,8/6/2012,5,"As easy as it gets.    I cut this in half to make a Sunday morning breakfast for DH, I added a 1/4 finely chopped green bellpepper,  served it on toast. he really enjoyed his treat, thank you, Bethie!!   made for ZWT 8"
852554,139213,8/6/2012,5,Yummy!  I used a couple jalapenos instead and threw in some cilantro.  Next time I'm going to add cheese and make it into a breakfast wrap with guacamole!  Made for ZWT 8
386585,139213,8/6/2012,5,"Super recipe - super fast and super tasty!  I had a lovely garden tomato (which I think makes all the difference) and used 2 skinny little serrano peppers with 6 large eggs.  I did add a drop of milk to the eggs, and seasoned the onion, peppers and tomato with some salt and pepper before adding the eggs.  I also added a handful of shredded sharp cheddar cheese at the very end.  A delicious and filling breakfast that I will be making again!  Made for ZWT 8."
133174,139213,8/7/2012,4,This made a very nice breakfast.  The oil was omitted and only a small amount of butter used to cook the beggies.  The eggs were beaten with a small amount of plain yogurt before adding to the cooked onion and pepper.  This was served with a toasted bread but would also be delicious in a tortilla.  Made for ZWT 8.
780172,139213,8/7/2012,5,"Quick, easy and has a nice little kick to it, just how I like my eggs. Sprayed the pan with oil and skipped the butter. Made for ZWT8."
67728,139213,8/9/2012,5,"This pretty much duplicated the eggs that my MIL makes when DH and I visit Mexico. I halved the recipe for one serving, and I used cooking spray on the pan instead of butter. I added in a bit of chopped smoked ham in the name of cleaning out some leftover items (the ham didn't have anywhere better to be, lol). I also added a bit of fresh ground pepper with the salt.  I served this with a couple slices of queso blanco and some warm corn tortillas for a nice quick comforting breakfast. Thanks for posting! Made for The Honeys for ZWT8"
305531,139213,8/9/2012,5,Good eggs. I made these as directed and thought that they were simple and good. Thanks Bethie for a nice breakfast. Made for ZWT8 - Mexico/Tex Mex.
171790,139213,8/12/2012,5,This is a very nice way to make scrambled eggs. I cut the recipe in half and substituted a green onion for the onion. Made for ZWT8
169430,139213,8/27/2012,5,Another 5 rating from me. I can only echo all that  the others have said and add that it made a perfect quick and easy dinner this evening. I added some shredded cheese on top before taking them out of the pan. Yum!
1023550,141963,1/9/2009,5,"Awesome!  I couldn't get shallots because I live in China and couldn't find them, but I used a white onion instead.  Delicious and healthy.  I will cook this many more times in the future.  Thank-you."
133174,204621,4/6/2008,5,"Truly and outstanding dish!  This was reduced to 2 servings and actually got quite a bit more than that.  For the coconut milk, I used recipe #187372 which worked like a charm and I am sure reduced the calories and fat considerably.  The spaghetti was angel hair.  The completed dish was plated and garnished with the chopped peanuts and some sliced green onions.  Made for PAC Spring 2008."
39835,211481,2/20/2007,4,"Good and easy! I also added 1/2 green pepper, chopped and used 2 garlic cloves, minced instead of the garlic powder. Thanks for sharing!"
199848,211481,4/15/2007,5,"We enjoyed this very much.  I used bow tie pasta, but made no other changes.  It is mild, but in a good way.  It's a great way to dress up imitation crab.  I used the optional cilantro and (although it was dried) it was a wonderful addition!  I recommend using it.  I'll use this recipe again.  Thanx for posting it."
1795721,211481,1/15/2011,0,This is just what I'm looking for! My daughter loves crab and I'm having a baby shower for her next week. <br/>I wanted to make a creamy pasta with crab and this looks perfect. I am going to use lump crab and add some sundried tomatoes and asparagus but I think it will be fine. The clam juice is perfect to pump up the seafood flavor. <br/>Thanks for the recipe. I'll let you know how everyone likes it.
592007,211481,7/7/2013,5,This is an Excellent Recipe! I did use fresh parsley for garnish as you suggested and put some parmesian cheese as a topping and it was Fabulouso ! Thanks for sharing!
280271,211481,3/10/2017,5,We really enjoyed this dish...I added some Parmesan cheese on top...it did seem to need additional spice so sprinkled some Johnny's seafood seasoning and that made a bit difference...loved that it used imitation crabmeat...very inexpensive dish to prepare...served it with a salad and some garlic bread...made for &quot;Went to Market&quot; tag game...
345569,217727,1/20/2008,5,"A direct quote: ""I don't like almonds, but if I did like almonds, I'd give this five stars.""  I guess that about says it all!  They were really easy to make ... the hardest part was finding almond flour!  When I finally did find it, it was so expensive that I decided to just grind my own.  I used a 9-oz can of almonds, and I had plenty of ""flour"" left over... but I only got 14 snowballs, not 24!  Thanks for posting.  Made for Photo Swap, January '08."
179133,217727,12/15/2009,4,"I found these kind-of odd. The texture of the dough was like thick wallpaper paste and was incredibly sticky. I found wetting my hands slightly to be the best way of rolling the balls. The taste is good, but not outstanding. I used sliced almonds that I ground in the food processor, measured out 1 cup worth, then processed further to get a paste consistency. I am experimenting with gluten-free recipes for a friend, but I don't think this one will make the cut, sorry. I was glad to try it out though. [Made for Let's P-A-R-T-Y! 2009]"
37449,314501,2/25/2010,5,"Easy, quick and delicious! I loved the flavors and quartered the recipe. Thanks, so glad I tried this! Made for Newest Zaar tag."
37449,360800,4/8/2009,5,Simply delicious! I was craving chickpeas and this was so satisfying. Thanks Nasseh! Made for Newest Zaar Tag.
226066,360800,5/21/2009,5,"Love chickpeas, love olives - LOVED this!!  Just added some fresh ground pepper - mmmm good!! Thanks Nasseh!"
337963,360800,12/5/2009,4,"Loved it!  Chickpeas are my all time favorite food, with olives being pretty high up on my list too, so I knew I couldn't go wrong here.  I used fresh parsley rather than cilantro.  I think I'll use a little less lemon juice next time, but that's just personal preference.  Thanks for a keeper Nasseh!"
386585,360800,12/20/2009,4,"This was really nice, and easy to boot!  I used kalamata olives, and the brininess really worked well with the other ingredients.  It made a very nice lunch.  Thanks for sharing this!"
199848,360800,3/9/2010,5,"Fresh and light flavor!   So easy to make, too.  I usually always have these items in the house and never thought to put them together.   I made this as directed, using a bit more than a pinch of paprika.  This makes a nice side salad or light lunch.  Thanx!"
593927,360800,9/4/2010,5,This is really good. I made ours without the cayenne pepper out of preference and used dark Lebanese olives that are quite salty and strong tasting which went well with the chickpeas. Made for Ramadan Tag 2010.
2432231,360800,10/3/2012,4,"I also added few tomatoes and white onions. Quick, easy and nutricious - if you remove the olive oil, the calorie count from fat will be much lower."
542159,457218,5/29/2011,4,A nice bread that yes is very dense. DH liked the honey while I would have liked a little more rosemary. I am thankful you put in your description about the stickiness as even armed with that info thought I might of blown the recipe. This recipe was made using whole wheat flour and did use the egg white wash and rosemary black pepper topping. Thank for the post.
151991,478714,8/21/2017,5,This a great sauce. I just mash all 3 bananas. Sometimes I add a cup of chopped pecans and use it to top waffles or pancakes. Thank you for pisting this recipe!
617372,19907,5/11/2009,5,I had this on Italian bread for lunch and it was just what I needed!  Thanks!
181231,36254,9/27/2005,0,You can't beat potato soup on a cold winter day.Be sure to cook bacon before adding to soup or use the precooked kind.I thought I should post this warning for any new cooks.
29920,46867,2/2/2003,5,"Oh Michelle!I used this as a sauce instead of a marinade and it was scrumptious!I baked some chicken legs for about 40 min and added this sauce to it and let it cook for another 15 min and oh wee!I was using the chicken to stuff pot stickers and I barley had enough 'cause I kept eatin' it as I stuffed!I will try this as a marinade next time, maybe on some pork steaks!I only made 1 change and that was to add some crushed red peppers!Michelle I would like to compliment you on all your wonderful recipes.You are definatly a 5 star chef!!I am lucky to have picked a chef with such wonderful recipes as you!!:)"
49482,46867,3/18/2003,5,"This is so fantastic! I marinated a thick juicy steak with it and it's absolutely great. Followed your instructions to a T. I am now anxious to try marinating some veggies in this too! Red and green pepper, onion and zucchini. Thanks Michelle for a great marinade!"
30298,46867,11/10/2003,5,"This was great.  I used it with chicken breasts, and the flavor was wonderful!  Thanks!"
34146,46867,4/28/2004,5,"Made this last night for a London Broil that DH & DS had for dinner this evening. I let the meat marinate for 12 hours, turned it once, after 6 hours. Grilled the London Broil on the BBQ. 
The guys loved it.....said it was very tender and flavorful, and did not overpower the flavor of the beef. Thanks for posting."
35140,46867,4/6/2006,5,"I used this on a cheap roast and not only did it tenderize it, the flavor was incredible.  Excellent."
244506,46867,7/29/2006,5,wonderful! I used the marinade for shish-kabobs. They were awesome!
321965,46867,1/3/2007,5,There is no way you can go wrong with this recipe.  Definately recommend it.  Thank you Michelle =)
203362,46867,9/19/2007,5,"used this for steaks, and it was very tasty..perfect for summer grilling!"
461834,46867,1/25/2008,4,Made this to marinade pork steaks for dinner last night.  I put the pork steaks in the marinade in the early morning and then took them out of the refrigerator about an hour before grilling.  This got mixed reviews and was a little on the sweet side for me.  Would make again but cut back on the brown sugar next time.  Thanks for a simple tasty marinade.
383346,46867,2/7/2008,5,"I let marinate boneless pork chops for maybe 9-10 hours.  I'm sure if it would have been 24 hours, it would have taste even better.  But I like the sweetness of it.  I grilled them in a skillet and ended the cooking in a preheated oven of 350 F until it reaches a good temperature.  Thanks Michelle :)  Made for Zaar Star Game."
50969,46867,6/6/2008,5,"Even though this recipe already had several five star ratings, I didn't think another on would hurt.I made this on 6/4/08 to give the steaks enough time to absorb the marinade. And I pan-fried the steaks on 6/5/08. And I have to tell you, this marinade made my steak the best I've ever made at home.It was so full of flavor,and so juicy.This ""WILL"" be made again.Thank you so much for posting and, ""Keep Smiling :)"""
213139,46867,8/26/2011,5,This made a very tasty marinade for our country style boneless pork.  Only marinated them for about an hour because I forgot to do them in the morning.  Poked some holes in the meat with a fork and used my vacuum sealer marinating container and they tasted great.  Will definitely make these again and marinate them overnight. Made for Healthy Choices ABC Tag
35965,53749,3/27/2003,5,"These were very good!  I had actually packed up both of my deep fat fryers to get rid of, but unpacked one of them after making these in my wok (I decided that wouldn't be a safe alternative for deep frying in the future).  I was thinking that we rarily deep-fry foods as I tend to get sick from too many fried foods to begin with, but after making these, I guess we'll be having more deep-fried than I was thinking.  My family loved them!  I used co-jack (monterey jack/colby blend) cheese in these this time.  I will experiment with various cheeses in the future.  I didn't have any 'left-over' mashed potatoes, so I boiled, mashed and chilled some fresh ones.  They made a really nice side dish.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Laurie!"
250920,53749,5/15/2006,3,My family didn't go for these as much as I hoped.  They are good to have when you have some leftover mashed potatoes but I don't think I'll add this to my recipes.  If we were to make these again we'd make the potato drops smaller since our fryer cooks pretty hot and has a tendency to burn the outside before cooking the inside all of the way through.  (We can't adjust the temperature so this was a careful process with some successes).
321371,53749,1/15/2009,5,"This is the recipe I've been hunting for for years! This taste just like the potato cheese puffs served at the Bavarian Inn in Frankenmoth, MI.  Thanks so much for posting...this is a keeping!"
1142804,53749,6/16/2009,5,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!  I have been trying to find a recipe for the Bavarian Inn's potato cheese puffs in Frankenmuth, MI for YEARS!!  Not to mention all the time I've spent trying to duplicate it.  This is it!!"
1800073293,53749,9/24/2013,1,"made them exactly how the recipe said and no matter how low we turned the fryer they all tasted like burnt cheese. they were not light and fluffy like in Frankenmuth. they were really dense and I could not taste any potato in them. The only thing it did was waste a perfectly good package of cheese. and one other thing is that there should be some type of coating on the outside of them to get them crispy. we also think there should be sour cream in the batter, it would help them hold togeather and give them a creamier flavor."
37449,128265,9/14/2005,5,"My DH and I really enjoyed these broccoli stuffed potatoes. I was going to just lay the broccoli on the potatoes, then I needed a cheese sauce and found this recipe. Glad I did! Thank you!"
83314,128265,4/21/2006,4,"I love broccoli, but DH isn't enthusiastic about it. We both enjoyed this recipe and it was very easy to prepare. "
125640,128265,3/2/2007,3,"Followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty good. These aren't as rich and creamy as we're used to for twice bakeds and weren't as cheesy as I expected, so we thought it definately needed some butter added to the mix and a little extra cheese; also I think a little garlic powder would be a nice addition just for our personal tastes if I make these again. Thanks for posting."
317267,21154,8/13/2006,2,"way more liquid then i expected, i had to drain it over night n then again before i cooked it. the cornmeal gave it a texture/grit i was not expecting. needed a lot more seasoning. i did like the hash brown similarities."
54678,131359,8/4/2005,5,"Made this exactly and it was hit with the weekend crowd at camp. We made up the cheese mixture ahead of time and kept refrigerated and when we needed an appy couple days later, I just followed the rest of the instructions. I was leary of the cooking time so took out after 45mins but prob the 60 mins okay."
186070,201954,12/31/2006,5,"Excellent coffee cake easy and tasty. Made almost exactly as written but did not have vanilla yogurt so subbed sourcream with about 1 tsp. of vanilla stirred in. I baked for 40 minutes but really could have used 45 or 50 as the bottom layer middle was still very gooey but we just cut that part off and ate it any way.  The middle layer of cinnamon, butter and sugar is very thick as I made it in a 9 inch springform pan.  If you like it rich leave it as is or you might halve the filling or double the batter but you will need a larger pan.  Spray the pan very well as the lovely carmel layer wants to stick.  All and all a very pleasy delicious desert or breakfast.  Thank you for the great recipe."
353536,201954,1/4/2007,3,"I liked this recipe but found that the bottom ""caramel"" didnt come out sticky enough... Im thinking next time I make it I will pour the caramel bottom over the top of the cake instead..."
59780,201954,4/28/2007,4,"This was a great coffee cake! I checked it after 40 minutes and it still need the full hour before it was baked fully. The bottom layer did not come out when I flipped the cake over, so I scraped it out and placed it on top. It did n;t look as pretty but still tasted good!"
424680,215757,3/15/2007,5,"Had picked this recipe out not long ago as something I definitely wanted to try, even though I'm not a big fan of asparagus! Well, I finally made it, & surprise, surprise, I found it to be very, very satisfying, while my other half said it was OUTSTANDING! So, WE are giving it 5 stars! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
464797,215757,3/17/2007,5,This recipe was wonderful!  I will definitely be making it again.  Thank you so much - my family and I loved it.
107583,215757,4/8/2007,5,This was delicious!  Made a nice first course for Easter dinner.  And so easy!  Will be making this again!  Thanks for posting.
50509,215757,2/17/2008,4,"Mine did not turn out as green as the photo - I wonder why? I loved using the rice and then blending all of it to create creaminess with no fat. After tasting, I increased the spices just a little, and I did increase salt as I was using myown salt-free broth. I had lovely fresh asparagus spears, and that nice green quality came through, as they are not overcooked. Thanks for a nice soup. I had to add more broth, and this was about 2 1/2 servings for us."
157425,215757,2/22/2008,5,"Wonderful soup Andi, thank you so much for sharing it with us! I used fresh asparagus and ran out of long grain rice so I used the wild rice from a box of Uncle Bens mix. Added the butter, used chicken stock, and heavy cream at the end. This soup can be perfect comfort food or served at an elegant dinner party. Thanks again hon!!"
713116,215757,4/14/2008,4,"This was very good - a nice light soup that we had for lunch.  I used homemade chicken stock, so I had to add a bit more salt.  The red pepper really came through, next time I'll probably cut back a bit, and I think I'll use less stock to get a thicker broth - I may not have used enough asparagus, but this was not as thick as some of the beautiful pics already posted.  
This is merely personal preference, this soup has great flavor, and we'll make it again!"
197023,215757,9/13/2008,5,"I made this delicious soup during the week, then also enjoyed it for one day during the week for a take-to-work lunch. I used my Vegetable Stock Recipe #135453 and omitted the red pepper flakes (personal taste preference), and to make the soup thicker I more or less doubled the asparagus and do admit that did cheat there (sorry, Andi) by using canned asparagus spears. For a mid-week dinner, it did make it easier! I used Greek yoghurt instead of cream and removed 1/4 cup of the rice asparagus mixture so I could blend the soup in the pot with my stick blender - much easier. Realised after blending that the cream was supposed to go in last! Not a problem: I simply added a dollop of Greek yoghurt to each bowl. Delicious! We loved this, and it was so quick and easy to make. Thanks for sharing another great recipe, Andi! And yet again, I loved your back story: this time of the little asparagus heads."
110078,215757,4/17/2009,5,"This was absolutely amazing!  I cannot wait to make it again, except I have to double it...  I did increase the seasoning salt to a tsp but, we like things salty."
226863,215757,9/14/2009,5,"I made this for dinner tonight after a long day at work.  It is quick to put together, and tastes great!  I can't wait until the cooler weather arrives to make this again.  I used homemade chicken stock, and I think that made mine look ""browner"" than some of the other reviewer's.  I would add a little more asparagus next time....because I love asparagus!  Thanks for sharing your wonderful story and your great recipe.  Made for Fall PAC 2009."
286566,215757,1/17/2010,5,"The DM and I have just enjoyed this delightfully delcious asparagus soup for lunch with some buttered wholemeal/wholegrain bread.  I smoothed it all out (the only way I can get the DM to eat it - doesn't like the lumpy bits) and just sliced a spear to decorate mine.  Thanks Andi, made the January Event - Soup Is On."
142617,215757,1/18/2010,4,Very easy to  make but I thought it was a little bland.  I added 3 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh dill and 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice and like it much better - also added more salt.   Next time I'll  sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top.
130663,215757,1/28/2010,5,"Delicious,just added a bit more salt & pepper.Made with my homegrown asparagus. For Everyday is a Holiday,2010."
405233,215757,2/27/2010,5,"Nice,easy and very tasty!! The rice gives it a nice texture.  I added a bit of fresh marjoram, abd along with the dash of red pepper flakes - gave it a little zing- but not too much.  Did not add the asparagus tips to the soup.  Instead I sauteed them w/ some chicken-garlic-herb sausages (already pre-cooked in the package) and added it all to the blended soup at the end.  That way you had a little protein and something to chew.  Besides I hate to pulverize those wonderful little tips! 
Used fat free half and half - probably about 1/4 cup (why take it out of the fridge for a tablespoon?!) And didn't have the croutons or saffron.
But, a nice glass of white wine and some crusty french bread topped it all off nicely.  Hubby and I had a fabulous lunch!!"
324390,215757,4/5/2010,5,"This soup is a wonderful way to welcome spring! I was surprised how much the rice fluffed up and made the soup perfectly thickened. I cubed some day old bread and pan fried it with a little oil, butter, garlic salt and seasoning salt to top it off. I'll be making this one all spring long! Made for PAC '10."
707663,406219,2/15/2010,5,"This soup is amazing! Easy, delicious, warm and comforting! I'd dare say better than Panera Bread's soup. I did make it wheat free/gluten free by thickening it with a cornstarch and water mixture (just eyeball the amount) instead of the flour. We entered this in a ""soupfest"" gathering where the competition can be pretty fierce and we won first prize! Thanks for the recipe AmyZoe!"
315479,406219,12/7/2010,5,"I chose this recipe because I have three daughters who love Panera Broccoli Cheddar soup. After I looked at it, I wondered if it could be as good because it was so simple. I added a bit of dried minced onion and used vegetable stock and low fat cheddar. I just cooked the broccoli in the stock, then pureed it. It was fantastic! It was thicker than Panera's, which I liked, but for the girls, I might use less flour next time. They also suggested adding some chopped carrot, which I may try. This is a keeper!!"
1221074,406219,1/8/2012,5,Right on!!! This IS panera bread soup! I added a grated carrot to give it color and to be just like panera and VOILA! Very nice on a warm rainy day.
650938,406219,1/29/2012,5,This was really good soup.  Mine didn't really thicken up so next time I'll add more flour and that suggested carrot.
2709872,406219,11/11/2013,5,"I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted exactly like the soup i had just bought at the store!!!&lt;br/&gt;The only think I will do different next time is double the amount,"
539686,434181,6/7/2011,5,Made for ZWT #7 and our team Witchin Kitchen...and so glad I did. It is great and a wonderful way to incorporate the healthy quinoa into a regular American dinner. I served it with pork chops and sourdough bread.
37449,434181,5/8/2013,5,Tasty salad!  Also healthy and filling.  Loved the mint and feta. Thanks Jenny! Made for being VIP in the Vegetarian Swap - May 2013.
47892,434181,5/14/2013,5,"Made as written except for lining bowls with fresh baby spinach and baby arugula for a &quot;meal in bowl&quot;. Delicious, quick and very easy to make. I served the veggie bowls at room temperature. I like the use of the sherry vinegar in this recipe. The quinoa was cooked with weakened veggie broth for added flavor. Fresh mint from our garden-good quality organic feta. Yum! Made for Veg Tag/May."
57222,434181,5/26/2013,5,"Oh, so good!! The feta &amp; chickpeas give the salad a wonderfully savoury flavour. I made 1/2 recipe, used steamed regular spinach instead of baby spinach, and stirred in all the feta. As both I and my grocer were out of sherry vinegar (gasp!!), I had to make do with red wine vinegar - and the salad was still insanely good! Thank you for sharing!"
486725,434181,3/11/2014,4,"I have never made quinoa with smoked paprika, and loved the addition of it. The cucumbers were also one of my favorite parts, so I think I would add lots more of those for extra crunch. I always toast then rinse my quinoa and then cook it with broth, so did that here. I used about half the cheese and only a tablespoon of oil for our tastes. We really liked this dish and its flavors, and enjoyed it as an entree."
227978,441733,11/29/2010,4,"We enjoyed this dish because it was so easy to prepare and was on the table in such a short period of time.  But we felt the amount of wine was excessive because it seemed to overpower the rest of the ingredients.  For the cheese, I used all sharp cheddar (since I dind't have any gruyere on hand), and I thought that was a great touch.  Thank you for posting your recipe, June Langton."
1701315,444030,3/1/2011,5,"As you can see from the pictures, I used loaf pans because the batter wouldn't all fit in my bundt pan.   (I think it is a bit on the smaller side as I've had that problem before.)  I don't think that would affect the recipe too terribly much, but I'm not a baker normally, so if anyone disagrees, please feel free to say so!<br/>That said, this is yummy yummy yummy!  Dense, moist...almost a banana bread consistency (at least in my loaf pans, lol :D )  I love the pineapple/banana/pecan combination in this cake. And the amount of spice from the cinnamon really allows those flavors to shine!  It feels very nostalgic to me... like something my Grams would have made (if she could cook!!!).<br/>Delightful warm, can't wait to try it cooled...maybe with a sprinkling of powdered sugar (my mouth is watering just thinking about it). Thanks, AuntCoco for yet another winner!"
50509,460277,11/11/2013,5,"What a wonderful treat! I reduced the ingredients to make a cheesecake for my 6&quot; springform pan and then cooked it in the slow cooker. I was a bit nervous, as the filling was much more liquid than I am accustomed to, but it worked out beautifully. I forgot the icing sugar in the crust, and used 2 1/2 tbl butter (made half the recipe of the crust), and it worked out just great. Definitely a cheesecake to consider."
163112,493845,9/14/2013,5,"Ooh quick, easy &amp; utterly delicious!  I used a cast iron skillet to &#039;grill&#039; the figs.  I cut this down to 2 servings but added an extra fig.  ;)  Very nice serving size.  I left out the water &amp; used a splash extra orange blossom water instead.  It came through nicely but wasn&#039;t overpowering.  I basted the figs, lol, but in the end wished I hadn&#039;t.  When the figs were removed, I added the rest of the syrup to heat for just a moment before pouring it over the sundaes.  I wished I&#039;d had more syrup but I&#039;d used it basting.  DD &amp; I thoroughly enjoyed this treat &amp; I even got a pic for ya!  Made forrrr....Autumn NA/ME Tag  9/13.  :)  Thanks, A!"
47892,493845,12/18/2013,5,I tossed everything in the blender and blended for a full 2 minutes. *Yum*! My changes were I used dried figs (barhi figs) and I didn&#039;t grill them and added a small pinch of cardamom. Made for NA*ME tag Dec-Feb 2014.
1802656792,496008,4/10/2014,1,"Oh my goodness this was just plain awful. Even after 3 hours cooking, the rice is still hard and the tofu is chunky. &lt;br/&gt;Trying to save it by letting it cook longer. There HAS to be a step or three missing."
42586,21154,3/24/2003,5,"I saw this recipe and had to try it for my girls who will eat anything that looks slightly like a pancake (small, flat, and round lol).  Of course, my 2.5 year old immediately saw the green and turned up her now, but my 1 year old and I really enjoyed them.  I served them with a simple dip of diced cucumbers, yogurt, and dill.  A lot of liquid did develop, and as suggested I drained and it worked well.  Thank you!"
59064,21154,6/5/2005,5,"These are excellent!
Easy to make and the batter ended up the perfect consistency. Fried up very well. Enjoyed by both the one year old and the 4 year old so it definitely passes the kid friendly test. And passes the adult approval test for sneaking in zucchini!"
161747,21154,11/22/2005,5,Yummy!  I just love fritters and these have become a very welcome addition to my collection.  Thanks.
125640,21154,2/20/2006,5,"I somehow missed adding the onion, but I think the fritters forgave me. Aside from that, I made them exactly as directed and served them plain and they were absolutely delicious. I think next time they'll be a breakfast food as they remind me so much of hash brown patties, but the zucchini really does make them something special. And the butter and olive oil mixture they're cooked in really brings out the flavors. Thanks so much for sharing."
189643,21154,9/1/2007,5,"I loved these. I liked the texture of the cornmeal. I did end up straining it quickly before I fried the fritters; I think I'll salt the zucchini and let it sit in a colander for a few minutes first and then I don't think it will need the straining later. (I didn't like watching all my yummy ingredients going down the drain.) But these were easy to put together and delicious. I made a whole meal out of them, dipping in sour cream. Yum!"
666682,21154,11/29/2007,3,"I made sure to read all the reviews before starting the process. I decided to squeeze out liquid from the potato & zucchini with a cloth before mixing all the ingredients based on the comments. I had a hard time cooking them though. The parmesan cheese just ran through the whole pan and made an awful mess over the entire pan. I got some help from my friend after the 1st batch got ruined. The fritters tasted great, but the cooking process I found was hard, next time I think I will omit the cheese."
507614,21154,1/15/2010,5,"Delicious! I did press out water from the zucchini before mixing it in with everything else and added a 1 tbs extra cornmeal to remove excess moisture. While I liked the olive oil/butter it was fried in, for simplicities sake the second time I made these I used regular vegetable oil for frying and they turned out just fine."
895132,21154,8/8/2011,5,"WOW - great fritters! Easy to make and gluten free, too, and VERY tasty. I omitted the cheese because I can't eat it, but I don't think it made a huge difference. They are very flavourful anyway, and I'll make them again often! Thanks for posting this keeper!"
1276184,21154,6/14/2012,5,"These are amazing!  I was looking for just a zucchini fritter recipe and I'm so glad I found this one!  The taters really added a nice texture and flavor - I forgot to skin the taters but it didn't seem to matter.  I had to add onion powder since I was out of fresh onion and I was out of corn meal so I substituted glutern-free Bisquick.  The batter wasn't too runny since I followed other reviewers suggestions about draining the vegies.  I also added dill which kicked up the flavor.  This recipe is a keeper!!  Thanks, Uncle Bill!!"
37107,21154,7/31/2014,3,"These weren&#039;t bad.  I&#039;ll tell you why I only gave a 3 star.  Before I mixed the potato and zucchini, I squished the grated veggies in paper towel to remove excess liquid.  Apparently that wasn&#039;t enough. I had soooooo much liquid at the bottom of my bowl that most of the seasonings were lost in it.  Next time I will sprinkle the salt on the zucchini and let sit in a colander for about 10 minutes before squeezing and mixing.  I also dredged the individual fritters in cornmeal as well as what was in the mix.  Made them crispier.  I&#039;m sure the next time I make these - and there will be a next time - they will be much tastier because all the seasonings will stay put and not get lost in the water that went down the drain."
1756250,24654,12/9/2010,4,This is really yummy!!!
59064,63961,11/6/2004,5,"These are delicious! I had no eggs in the fridge and my laying hen decided to sit in the laying boxes just when I decided I needed to raid it for eggs. So I decided to substitute applesauce for the egg [a vegan substitute]. Doesn't work very well as the pikelets all stuck to the frypan :(. But the edible bits were delicious. So I ended up dividing the left over batter between some ramekins and baked it at 180C for about 20min. Worked well too.
Update: Finally made these as the recipe states and it makes delicious pikelets. It is quite a thick batter so if you like a runny pikelet batter applesauce instead of apple or extra milk."
214855,63961,5/7/2006,5,Great easy last minute recipe. DD's rate it 5 stars!!
115758,63961,6/20/2006,5,"A nummy snack, I omitted the oil and cooked with a little butter in a non stick electric pan (I find it easier to regulate the heat better for piklets/pancakes in elec instead of on the gas)As with all piklets flip over only when the little bubbles have risen to the top and are starting to pop. A quick and easy snack, thanks for sharing!"
1598157,131904,4/15/2010,5,This is a must try.  Loved it!!
39334,137025,10/17/2005,5,"This was awesome!!! So easy to make and so dang YUMMY!! I did halve the recipe as I didn't need the full 20 servings, and I also used 1/2 c mustard and 1/2 c mayo...as we like mustardy potato salad. But other than that, I made it exactly as written and will make again and again!!! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe, TDC and congrats on winning the football pool! "
4740,137025,7/5/2009,5,"Yum. Simple is good. I'm not very good at making potato salads, but this one came out great for me."
261366,166433,5/6/2007,5,"This was so easy and turned out wonderful.  I too, used chicken breasts and was very happy with the outcome.  Very tasty!  Thanks!"
170628,166433,5/14/2007,4,"We enjoyed this, however it was very greasy using chicken party.  I would definitely use skinless chicken the next time.  In addition, I felt the sauce was too salty from the soy, so I had to add quite a bit more of the preserves to balance out the flavor. With those changes it is delicious!"
439056,166433,6/12/2007,4,"Super good! Thank you so much!! My husband and I both agree that next time, I'm gonna use more preserves! It was so good! We did ours over rice. Yum yum! Thanks again!! Love, Meg"
8629,207860,6/19/2010,5,"A very good big batch recipe for mayonnaise.  I don't think my eggs were free-range eggs but they worked just fine.  I used just about all of the 2 cups of vegetable oil called for. The mayonnaise was a great, smooth consistency.  I'll use this recipe again."
442988,166433,10/25/2007,5,"Very good!  I needed a chicken dish that was fast, easy, and flavorful, and this fit the bill perfectly.  I made the recipe pretty much as written, although I did use sherry instead of white wine (all I had on hand).  I particularly liked the little bite that came from the red pepper flakes; I thought the balance of sweet and hot was perfect, and (unlike other reviewers) I wouldn't add more preserves.  A definite keeper -- thanks for posting this!"
169969,166433,12/25/2007,5,Fabulous and easy! This is a great chicken recipe. I used boneless skinless breast. The marinade gets really thin as it cooks and I was afraid the flavor was not going to permeate the breasts and the chicken did not have skin for it to stick to .... but was I ever wrong. When the breast were finished cooking I basted them and put them under the broiler for a few minutes. This is a great recipe that takes hardly any time at all to put together. It is extremely kid friendly as well. I used low sodium soy and vermouth! Thank you Parsley for a great dinner!
350812,166433,6/18/2008,5,"EXCELLENT!  I had 3 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts, so I doubled the recipe.  The only changes I made were to NOT double the black pepper, and eliminate the red pepper & ginger.  My picky picky picky 7YO son actually ate an entire half a breast without a peep of complaint!  No higher compliment exists from him!  Thanks for sharing!"
323933,166433,6/10/2010,5,My husband raved about this!  I used one sliced yellow onion which I cooked in oil in the saucepan before adding 400ml apricot nectar (didn't have preserves) and I substituted 1tbsp grated fresh ginger for the powdered.  Left out the green onions and pepper flakes.  Thank you for submitting this recipe!
563496,166433,1/22/2014,5,"Good, quick, easy.  We all loved.  Leftovers were great too."
1160345,166433,6/28/2015,5,"I also used boneless chicken. Boneless skinless chicken leg meat and homemade apricot pineapple preserves. A pound and a half of it for the three of us (husband, son and myself) and the leftovers would have been great, had there BEEN any. I might go light on the pepper flakes next time but this is probably going to be our favorite recipe for a long time! Served with rice and a veggie and this is perfect."
83093,179578,9/21/2007,4,"These taste so good to be so easy! It took a bit of doing to get them baked as I was quite confused about the size.  I started with mini-muffin pans and liners but the vanilla wafers would not fit in them. I had some little amaretti cookies that did fit so they became my crust. With a scant 1 tablespoon of filling, they were filled to overflowing . Then I read step 7 -whoops! I'm guessing that for the minis, I should have used only 1 1/2 tsp. of filling. So I mixed up some more filling & used the vanilla wafers in standard cupcake liners.  Everything fit. The bake time was perfect for both sizes, surprisingly. They rose and fell some upon cooling like a cheesecake.  I topped some with cherry pie filling as suggested.  The flavors were scrumptious together.  Now that I've got the sizes and amounts figured out, ;-) I will make these often as a quick dessert or treat.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
226462,179578,10/5/2007,5,"Color Guard Mom, these are so yummy !  I actually made these and took to a tailgate party.  Once there I topped them with blueberry filling and they were gone in no time. These have already been requested again but in a larger quantity LOL. Wish I had a pic, but I had 18 people in my group and they were taking as I was topping ! These were made for PAC fall 2007."
535633,179578,3/9/2010,5,"Made these late last night,  I will be taking these to a meeting tonight.  Of course I had to try one.  Yummy.  I like the idea of putting these in paper liners.  I can't wait till the others tonight try these.  Thanks for the great recipe CGM.  I will be making again."
424333,183397,7/16/2009,5,"Easy to make, fast and very yummy!  I used large refrig. biscuits and rolled them out a little bigger.  Added all ingredients except the baharat and just added red pepper seasoning instead of the real thing."
239758,207860,2/4/2007,5,"This really is the best-ever mayonnaise, and it is so quick to make. Don't change a thing. You can use this recipe for all your mayonnaise needs."
344231,207860,4/25/2007,4,This is going to save me HEAPS of money. I'll never buy store-bought mayonnaise again. Thanks for posting. I used it to make Petroushka's Recipe#210251. Perfect fit!
157425,207860,8/9/2008,5,I was a little worried at first when I tasted the mayo because it seemed to salty. Put it in the fridge to set for awhile and used it to top Crafty Lady 13's recipe #316313 and the mayo was great. I did use my blender but next time I would use the food processer as the mayo had trouble blending at the top. Didnt find free range eggs so I used Eggland's Best and the 2 cups of vegetable oil. So much better and fresher tasting than store bought mayo.  Made and reviewed for Recipe Swap #19.
296809,207860,2/10/2009,5,"Tagging this recipe in the *Best of 2008* game was timely for me. DH & I had just *discussed* his habit of buying a sml amt of mayo & then asking me to make a big batch of tuna salad w/no mayo on-hand. I used my *Magic Bullet* & the recipe is all my fave things - an easy quick-fix, ingredient-friendly, tasty & easily doubled or halved. Food costs vary a lot here, but I will compare this for the future. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us. :-)"
1597124,207860,4/13/2010,0,Easy and flavourful but just a tad too salty.  Next time I'll use 11/2 tsp salt.
1835874,207860,5/1/2011,5,OMG! After trying another very finicky recipe (which was a disaster) Eureka! I will never buy mayonnaise again.  I made a half batch and used 1/2 tsp salt after reading previous reviews.  Thank you so much for sharing this gem of a recipe!
176342,207860,1/17/2012,5,"This really is very good. Most of the mayo recipes I'd tried didn't have a good ""bite"" but this is just sharp enough with a clean flavor. Very easy to make in a quart jar with a stick blender. I did not find it too salty at all ( be sure to use level teaspoon measures ;-)   )."
53932,207860,4/30/2012,5,I thought this was perfectly seasoned.  Very easy to make and very good
1264706,207860,10/19/2012,5,This was really good I made this with my magic bullet.  I didn't add all the oil and vinegar at once but it came out just fine.  I didn't measure the salt I just grind some in. It came out perfect. I don't think I will be buying mayo anymore.
2476219,207860,10/31/2012,5,"Absolutely amazing! Very easy and makes everything taste better. I have tried a couple of different oils and am really pleased with the grapeseed oil. Nice, mild flavor. I agree with others...this can be done in the blender but works better with processor. Perfect to dip fries in!"
2535042,207860,11/29/2012,5,This is a very good recipe. It makes quite a bit. I used grapeseed oil and apple cider vinegar. It came out beautifully and tasty. Only 1 tsp of real salt. Next time I may use half vinegar and half lemon juice. Don't use evoo it tastes bitter. Have fun playing  with this one. Perhaps some fresh cracked black pepper! Enjoy GMO free!
2355181,207860,1/20/2013,5,This was an easy recipe to follow and make.  Since I do not use salt I cut the salt by 1/4tsp and next time will only put in 1tsp instead.  This is a very good fresh tasting mayonnaise and will be making this instead of buying it.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone to make it is very good.<br/><br/>Jane
269575,207860,5/5/2013,5,"Great recipe, I used only half a teaspoon of mustard and i used 1 cup of olive oil and one cup of sunflower oil. I put the oil in 2 pop top drink bottles and this made a very consistent stream when pouring the oil, the mayonaise came out much thicker this way and it also thickens up more in the fridge. I also clean the eggs with abit of vinegar before cracking them to kill any harmful bacteria, as the dangerous bacterias that are a risk when using raw eggs are actually preesnt on the shell not inside the egg."
2423451,207860,5/9/2013,5,"WE love this.   As for the fresh eggs, I go outside to the chicken coop and get an egg or too.  I like the half vinegar and lemon juice version better.  I also use salt substuite because of my hubbies diet.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;if this repeats sorry."
761979,207860,8/10/2013,5,I thought I had some mayo in the fridge but it turned out to be Miracle Whip and I wanted to make this:  [url=www.food.com/recipe/chunky-blue-cheese-salad-dressing-55514]Chunk Blue Cheese Dressing[/url] so I halved this recipe and used it.  It turned out great!  I did leave the blunder running for a bit longer after I had finished pouring in the oil to fully incorporate it.  I used EVOO since that&#039;s about the only oil we ever use around here and it came out fine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I occasionally make another Mayo aka Beauty Mayo that has a lot of Apple Cider Vinegar in it which is too vinegary for his tastes and I didn&#039;t think it would work as well for the salad dressing.
1802468158,207860,2/8/2014,4,"I made this recipe to the letter!  Other than it being too salty, it turned out really well.  It had good consistency and overall flavor.  I will make this again but next time I will use 1 tsp. salt instead of 2.  We raise chickens, so we always have fresh eggs!  ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you for uploading this recipe!!!!"
1206909,207860,7/24/2014,5,WOW! Just made it and it was so easy and so delicious.  I am shocked at how easy it was in my nutribullet.  I will be doing homemade from now on!
1905458,207860,8/13/2014,0,"Was looking for a good mayonnaise.  And I have the freshest free range eggs available. .most times they are still warm, I have chooks. ( chickens for those in the USA)  Cant wait to make more"
5210524,207860,3/17/2015,5,I used 1 c canola oil and 1 c veggie oil &amp; only 1-1/2 tsp of salt.  Tastes very similar to the real Best Foods mayo but without all the preservatives and NO GMO!  Will do again and use garlic and red wine vinegar.  I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be buying store-bought mayo again!
2000184335,207860,5/4/2015,5,"I tried this several ways.  All were easy and good however malt vinegar tasted the closest to store bought Best Foods or Hellman&#039;s. (not Merical Whip which has high sugar content.  I too thought it was salty UNTILL I let it get cold, like regular Mayo.  As any good cook knows, chilling decreases seasoning.  It&#039;s why homemade Ice-cream will taste too sweet until it&#039;s chilled. So once chilled this mayo was not salty at all.  Had I reduced the salt, tasting it warm, it would not have tasted as authentic once chilled. 

Christopher Lowell"
1802998801,207860,11/1/2015,0,"simple, quick, tasty--added fresh dill and it was really good. great base for herbal mayo and garlic mayo thanks"
2001062421,207860,6/25/2016,2,I have been making homemade mayonnaise for over 20 years and this is the worst tasting mayonnaise I have ever made. It had too much salt and too much white vinegar in it. I will not be making this again.
2384579,207860,9/25/2016,3,"Very good, but too much mustard and vinegar (I used white wine vinegar). Tasty, but definitely a much stronger flavor than I wanted or expected. I would say truly outstanding for ham sandwiches, but I was making a waldorf salad and needed something milder. That said -- I thinned it out with yogurt and my salad was a big hit."
2001260086,207860,11/22/2016,1,Yuck!!! I thought this was TERRIBLE!!!!!! Waaaaaaaaaaaay too much vinegar!!!!! It almost made me gag just smelling the finished product--smelled like it was almost all vinegar. (I used white vinegar.) I will definitely NOT be trying this recipe again.. :( What a waste of ingredients....I don't even really want to even give it 1 star
431813,221978,4/19/2007,5,"I probably would have normally given this four stars, but it was just so quick and easy, I had to give it five!  Excellent flavours.  We love anything with lemon and capers, and the pork was so tender!  Thanks for a great recipe!"
431813,304643,6/2/2008,4,"Very tasty salad!  Our only complaint was that the dressing was a bit too tart.  Maybe a bit more mustard next time.  Overall, quite yummy! Thanks Leopard Apron!"
461283,304643,6/11/2008,4,"I think the dressing ingredients should be more like 1/4 Cup olive oil and 4-6 TBS lemon juice. Instead of the other way around. Other than that, this is a wonderful salad and I will make this again."
498271,304643,4/10/2012,4,Very simple and tasty salad!  I really liked the lemon and dijon in the dressing but I did add a teaspoon of sugar to cut the tartness just a bit.  The optional parmesan cheese was a great topping to add a bit of salty flavor too.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for Spring Pick-A-Chef 2012
338515,174325,12/5/2007,5,"A quick, easy, and tasty recipe that looks like it came out of a top restaurant!  This is one of our favourites at home (as well as the cookbook!)"
37449,175669,8/20/2006,5,"Delicious! I made as directed, but used all 26 ounces of the spaghetti sauce I had. Everybody loved it! Thanks Luv!"
112077,175669,11/1/2006,5,"Delicious, wholesome, and healthy.  My husband and 2 children liked it (a rare occurrence in my house)! Thanks for sharing.  "
1198491,175669,11/22/2009,5,"delicious and a great way to add veggies to your kids' meal!  I pretty much doubled the recipe and used a full box of recipe-ready lasagna noodles.  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese because it's what I had and used extra sauce.  By doubling the recipe, it needed extra oven time, approx. 45-50 mins total."
223979,199891,5/26/2010,5,This is great.  A wonderful springtime dinner.  So many fresh ingredients.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Would not change a thing!  Served this over fettucine.  Made for the Bargain Basement tag game.
890853,233972,4/27/2009,5,"I use chicken (grill method) to make delicious torta-type sandwiches.  We spread a little avocado on some bread, top with the chicken, lettuce, onions, and a little El Pato spicy tomato sauce.  So good!"
1100313,256419,8/13/2010,4,Very good! Missing one star because it needs a sprinkle of sesame seeds.
361069,276350,7/8/2008,5,"yuuuuummmmm!!! This was beautiful.

I added garlic too, and used 4 potatoes.
I ended up having not much time on my hands, so instead of letting the sauce reduce down i added 1 tspn of gravox to the stock and quickly stirred it before spooning it over our lamb......what can i say...these tatoes were tasty as!"
832955,278695,2/13/2009,5,This was awesome!!!  We would make it with a little more of the veggies - but otherwise - it was perfect!  Made it with Jasmine rice and used basil.  Fantastic!  Couldn't recommend it more!!!
1695994,278695,10/2/2010,5,Excellent with jasmine rice. I used some fresh sweet corn in the packet and it was fantastic!
206385,288205,3/16/2008,5,"I was looking for a simple granola recipe and this is exactly that.  It was very easy to put together, and smelled heavenly while baking.  I will definitely be using this one from now on.  And as an added bonus, Anything you like can be added.  Coconut, craisins, dates, nuts, etc.  I plan to be a little more adventurous with the ingredients as time goes by.  But, for now, this is perfect as is."
619973,288205,3/25/2008,5,"I have searched for days for a good granola recipe and finnally did this one delish thank you...I made a few subs and additions, took out the ground flax seeds and added a 1/2 cup wheat germ, sliced almonds and about a 1/4 cp of pecans, and for the ""other"" cookie sheet full I added when done 1/4 lil choco chips and some cherry flav. crasins...kids just came home from school and are already eating lots they love it I am excited.... Thank you again....will be making this again and again"
564317,288205,10/9/2008,5,"This is a great granola recipe.  Because I don't always have everything, I revamped it a bit and like it even more.  
Instead of 1/2 C Corn Syrup, I used 1/4 C of Corn Syrup and 1/4 C Pure Maple Syrup.  I also added 1 C chopped almonds.  Yum yum!  My entire family loves it!"
986714,288205,12/18/2008,5,"This is great, even my five year old loves it.  I added pecans, slivered almonds and dried cranberries (stir in the cranberries after it's cooked and still warm or they get really chewy).  Delicious!!"
1168432,288205,1/18/2011,5,"this is a super easy, very yummy granola recipe! i followed the recipe, then i add extras later like raisins, craisin, or almonds. thanks for sharing!!"
870840,299157,5/4/2010,4,"This was enjoyable and quite simple to prepare.  I am not a vegan but am finding the benefits of eating less meat and being content with the many fruits, grains and vegetables the Lord Jesus has provided.  I did however, put in too much cajun seasoning thinking the recommended amount was too little.  This made it too spicy for my kids and I had to really encourage them to eat it allowing sips of their water or juice, whatever it was, after each bite.  But I enjoyed the spice!  If I make this again I might just leave out the cajun for my family and ad it just to my own bowel.  Jesus bless you for sharing!"
171303,306351,8/20/2009,4,"We enjoyed this recipe.  I did halve it with good success, and chose to grill the kabobs instead of broiling them.  Thank Queen Butter-Bean for sharing the recipe."
56061,306351,9/8/2009,5,"We picked this recipe because my kids loved your name.  Boy, did we luck out.  The meat was incredible.  We used ground beef and we gave the onions a whiz through the food processor, used fresh garlic and ginger, but otherwise followed the recipe...including the hummus, Israeli salad and bread.  Queen Butter-Bean, it was fantastic.  Thank you!!"
1470474,306351,12/3/2009,0,"This is just like we had in Israel.  I used half beef and half lamb, and grilled them.  They have lots of flavor and I'll make them again and again (it will be part of my Middle Eastern Christmas dinner menu).

Many thanks!"
451456,362232,3/7/2011,5,"Thank you for posting this refreshingly unique salad!  My best friend and I are beet fiends, and we really loved the way that the spinach and oranges complimented the earthy and sweet flavors of the beets.  The colors were beautiful as well.  I can't wait to make this again!  I used Recipe #443992 for the dressing.  The poppy seed dressing might have been a little too sweet for our taste."
1149132,369436,6/28/2009,4,"These are yummy! Make sure to flour when rolling out. I got 25 buns out of the recipe. The instruction line that says ""oil"" should be ""yogurt"".

15 mins was enough in my gas oven, otherwise the WW flour makes them a little doughy.

I had 4 LOL"
656928,369436,4/4/2010,1,"Unfortunately, these did not turn out at all for me.  I had problems from the first step.  The dough didn't rise, and they turned out heavy and tough.  Too bad - I had high hopes!"
78425,31610,8/30/2003,5,These are dee-licious!!!!  They are a huge hit!  Great for a crowd.  Perfect sweet/salty treat.
305531,385632,8/23/2009,5,Yummy! I made this as directed and really enjoyed the simplicity and the great taste. Thanks SB6 for a nice 'comfort' meal. Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag.
1170292,385632,9/12/2009,5,"This recipe was really good.  The steaks were so tender and tasted great.  I made mashed potatoes with them so I did make extra gravy.  I did not use the Kitchen Bouquet in it, cause I could not find it, but it was still delicious."
226863,385632,11/9/2009,3,"This was easy to make, but didn't turn out the way I thought it would taste. I'd cook the onions while the meat is browning, so that they are nice and tender in the gravy. My onions must have been very ""thick"", because they weren't tender after 1 1/2 hours of cooking. I was expecting a taste more like country fried steak, but as SB6 pointed out in her zmail in response to my review, that is not what she intended with this recipe. A side of sauteed mushrooms really compliments this dish."
1058097,385632,11/9/2009,5,"The cooking takes awhile, but there's very little work involved.  I left out the Kitchen Bouquet, which I don't care for.  It really didn't need it.  Nice tender meat.
Note:  This is country STYLE steak, which is not the same thing as country FRIED steak.  They are very different dishes, with different cooking methods."
614389,385632,12/19/2009,5,"My husband and I loved this recipe. It was delicious. The gravy was very good on the mashed potatoes.
Thank you !"
560491,385632,3/8/2010,3,"This was good, but after simmering for over an hour, my steaks were still a tough (needed a knife to cut them).  I added 1 tsp of the kitchen bouquet; never used it before so I wasn't sure what it was supposed to add as far as flavor wise (salty, smokey, etc.)  Served over buttered noodles (would have preferred potatoes but 4yr DS doesn't eat them and didn't want to make extra food).  Made for Cookbook Tag March 2010."
396078,385632,3/10/2010,4,"This is a very tasty and rich comfort food dish.  I could not find cube steaks at my local grocer, so I substituted beef top round cutlets.  The meat was tender with an intensely beefy, thick gravy.  I used 2 tsp. Kitchen Bouquet but should have only used 1 tsp., as it made the gravy too salty for DH and my taste.  DD enjoyed it emensely.  She couldn't shovel it into her little, newly teeth-populated mouth fast enough, gobbling up every last bit.  I served it over rice with a side of roasted asparagus.  This dish is definitely easy to prepare but not as ""quick"" as the recipe title implies.  Thanks for sharing!  (Made for AUS/NZ Recipe Swap #38)"
37449,411854,4/22/2010,5,"So good! I used some basil I had frozen from the garden, scaled the recipe down to make one nice sandwich. Thanks! Made for PAC(pick a chef) in the contests forum."
14000,360,1/17/2002,5,"A great dish, loved it. Your 2oz. cheddar cheese is only 1/4 cup, not 1/2 cup. Great taste."
258819,360,11/25/2006,5,"i enjoyed this, though I did make changes, I used whole eggs and also added more vegetables and lesser cheese. this will be made again in different avatars! thanks!"
27443,4034,5/22/2002,5,"This was wonderful, didn't have greens for salad, but was hungry for blue cheese. Served it with steamed asparagus, whole string beans, sliced zucchini, fennel and garnished with thumb tomatoes."
125266,4034,4/18/2004,5,"What do you do when you are having a dinner party with both vegans and meat-lovers invited? I made this recipe as the main course, with a vegetable stock substituted for the chicken broth. The blue cheese and thinly sliced grilled chorizo were served in side bowls for those that wanted to partake. Plenty of grilled vegetables, steaming noodles,a baby lettuce salad and a soy based coffee ice cream with ginger snaps rounded out the meal. It was fun to watch both groups bend some of their dietary restrictions and talk to each other."
221624,33496,4/8/2006,5,Excellent for dessert served with cold ice cream!!  I added a little bit of cinnamon to the batter as well.
99785,70671,11/25/2003,5,DH raved about this one!  I didnt use any orange rind but did everything else exactly.  Very good.
60575,70671,1/10/2004,5,Delicious and very easy to prepare.  I decided to replace the half cup of water with orange juice.  Great mix of flavors !
315684,70671,5/4/2006,5,"This one is a keeper.  I made this last night and we loved the flavor. The only thing I changed was the breadcrumbs. All I had was Japanese breadcrumbs, so I used those.  Great recipe. "
725448,70671,1/12/2008,4,"Easy to make and good, too.  I will definitely make again."
258528,70671,2/13/2008,5,"Outstanding recipe....easy to make.
Substituted orange juice for the water..Will make it again."
184723,86858,9/14/2005,5,My husband loved this.  We will definitely be making again as it is a good standby for when you don't have a lot of stuff in your kitchen... very filling and makes quite a bit.  We made with macaroni noodles!
559414,70671,5/24/2008,5,"Fantastically easy, chicken stayed really moist, great flavor.  As in another review, I also used orange juice instead of water.  Next time though, I might add a tad of lemon juice just to cut through the sweetness of the glaze."
354675,149502,3/14/2007,5,"Perfect Pita Scoops!  Why didn't I think to ever just toss them in a bowl with oil instead of painstakingly brushing each one with oil?  This is so much simpler and faster!  Omited the parm cheese since the dip I'm making has a ton of parm in it.  Anyway, these are great, thx so much!  PS: a little birdy told me they keep for 2 weeks at a cool temp or can be frozen!"
59478,165984,9/22/2012,4,"I wonder if there is an error in this recipe. I followed as instructed and batter was way to thin. I didn't measure, but I think 2 cups of Bisquick might be a better amount. They were quite yummy, though!"
360587,200162,1/26/2007,4,"Rachel Ray has never let me down. Anytime I want a fast, easy recipe that my whole family loves I turn to one of her books. This one is good with or without the cranberry sauce."
405597,218412,11/22/2009,5,"Great holiday cookie recipe, not too sweet and a wonderful old-fashioned home quality.  My Mom said she had fond memories of eating ones prepared by her grandmother, but we did not have that recipe.  According to her, this one is even better than the ones her grandmother made."
222564,218412,3/1/2014,5,Fantastic cookie to use up that left over mincemeat. I halved the granulated sugar and that suited us just well.
67656,257642,11/16/2007,3,"I loved the idea of these cookies and am always on the hunt for new additions to our family holiday trays.  The dough was a snap to put together and the taste was delicious, not unlike that of marzipan.  The lemon zest was very faint and acted more to highlight the wonderful almond flavor.  Chilled as stated and began to make the cookies.  Things sort of went downhill for me after that. I wasn't really clear about the size  of dough needed to yield 48 cookies and used my scoop that measures 2 teaspoons, turned out the right amount was about half that as I only had 23 logs.  Unfortunately, I started rolling since the dough was getting soft quite quickly.  I had a very difficult time with the egg wash -- messy aside -- as I didn't find that it helped the almonds adhere any better than simply rolling the dough in the nuts directly.  Ended up doing 1 dozen each way to see if there was a difference in the final results and did not find one. Given my thrill with the dough, I was a little disappointed with the final cookie which was a bit tough and lost some of the nutty flavor. I think this recipe has absolutely fabulous potential and want to experiment a bit more, for example, all that mushing to get the nuts to stick may require the dough to re-chill to get better results. Definitely planning to tinker."
704950,264927,4/24/2008,5,"What a delicious, exotic spice cake!  I love cardamom so I knew this would be good!  The spice combo turns out like chai tea flavor.  The confectioner's sugar on top sweetens it just right.  I halved the recipe because I don't have a bundt pan so I put the batter in a 2 qt, greased non-stick cake pan and it turned out great!
Thanks for this delicious recipe!!"
169430,264927,3/27/2009,3,"I made a half recipe and while I love spice cake this one was a bit overpowering for my taste. It's very moist and easy to make. I might make it again and trim back all of the spice except for the cinnamon. Made for Pac, Spring 09."
695933,264927,4/17/2013,5,"I loved this cake! It keeps it nice and simple, with the cardamom taking center stage but not overpowering. I loved how moist and fluffy it was! I made these into cupcakes, and they worked out wonderfully! THANK YOU !! for posting it."
233431,289469,12/11/2008,0,"These were made and given to me by one of my students around Valentine's Day 2008.
Oh...my....goodness. They are THAT good. You can use the recipe and your imagination to get a pretty good idea of what they'd be like, but in real life they are somehow about 350% better!  I'm not a huge butterscotch fan; I'd probably substitute dark chocolate; and you can probably use any nut you've got around (pecans).  I wish I could give it 10 stars!"
125388,289469,4/19/2010,5,"I saw the luscious picture of these pretzels on the TOH website and just had to try them.  I made 2 different styles; one type coated with a mixture of mini chocolate chips and plain toffee bits, and the other type coated with M&Ms.  The small size of the mini chips and toffee bits worked really well because they adhere so easily to the pretzels.  The M&M type were very colorful and would be great for kids.  I wanted to use the mini M&Ms but I couldn't find them in the stores.  I think they would have worked better and looked nicer than the large M&Ms.  The pretzels were fairly easy to cut in half; only a few didn't cut neatly.  (The ingredient should really be listed as pretzel rods instead of pretzels sticks.)  I made these by myself, but it would be quicker if 2 people were working together with one to dip the pretzels in caramel, and the other to dip them in the coating.  I had to stop and reheat the caramel often which would be lessened with 2 people.  Overall, a very fun (and tasty) project.  Also, 2 of these sticks fit nicely in a snack size zip-top bag which would be good to do for a bake sale."
173579,86858,9/20/2005,5,This is a very tasty recipe. DH and DS said I needed to make it often.  Thanks for posting.
248772,86858,10/10/2005,5,Wonderful for all agaes...A+
107583,435829,9/19/2010,5,"Delicious variation on an old favorite!  The lemon really makes this special.  I cut recipe in half with no problem.  I also sprinkled a bit of nutmeg on top, with the cinnamon.  Made for tag game at Kittencalskitchen.com"
1692486,438268,9/27/2010,5,"What a great way to start off my family's day! <br/>I used red and orange peppers along with some thinly sliced pepperoni for my carnivore hubby :)<br/>It turned out beautifully and was scrumptious. It was nice to learn a new way to enjoy the incredible, edible egg!!"
678456,438268,10/9/2010,5,"Excellent!  Followed recipe and they turned out really nice. Next time I might change up the veggies, maybe add ham or turkey, who knows. Might try with only egg whites to keep it even healthier."
542692,438268,11/19/2011,5,"OMG!!! I just made these to have for my low cal diet. I did make a couple of modifications out of taste and diet. I used spinach instead of the leeks and peppers, used skim milk, egg beaters (2 cups) instead of eggs, and used apple smoked gruyere instead of parm. I just had to try one tonight because they made the house smell so good, and they were unvbelievable!! A couple of notes, I had to cook them about 45 minutes because they still had liquid coming out after 25 and 35 minutes (but that might be the egg beaters) and next time I will cook them in muffin cups because they stuck to the pan a bit. But, Nikki, such an awesome recipe!!!! Thank you so much!!!"
877233,438268,9/18/2012,5,"These came out WONDERFULLY. Thanks, Nikki! I used 7 eggs instead of the eggs/whites because I feel weird about just using whites in things and wasting the yolks - yolks are the best part! :) Also added some bacon bits - makes them a tiny bit unhealthier but added an awesome dimension of flavor."
1803677434,510938,1/18/2015,5,"This was delicious.  I am not vegan, however, I do enjoy a lot of vegan recipes. To the mixture, I added kalamata olive tapenade for extra oomph. Other than that, I made as directed. Love, love, love the cashew spread! Will use this often. It&#039;s nice to take a break from animal products now and then. This recipe surly did the trick. Thanks Psalmsome!"
92001,91880,9/11/2004,5,"Now, that is an awesome recipe.  I was in the middle of making Pozole and after tasting it, I felt I was missing some key ingredients.  After looking through several recipes, Nurse Di came to the rescue and more!  The marjoram, oregan and black pepper were the exact things it needed!  Then, I got to learn of adding zuccini, and using pickled jalepenos and black olives as garnishes as well.  I also crumbled tortilla chips and added dollops of sour cream, and usually use lettuce and radishes as garnishes.  All in all, I love this recipe.  Something old and loved made new and exciting again.  Yum!  Thanks!"
101153,91880,10/28/2004,4,"Very good recipe, my family loved it. Easy to prepare and leave while at work.
I like anything that can be cooked in the crockpot!!!!"
339239,91880,1/26/2007,5,"This recipe is perfect! The spices blend nicely. I omitted the zucchini and jalapeno (didn't have them on hand), added an extra can of hominy, and used pork rib meat. I threw everything in to the crockpot, except the hominy, and had it on high for 2 hours, then lowered it to low for another 4 hours. Just before serving I added the hominy and garnished with shredded cabbage. My husband loved it and so did my daughter. We had enough leftovers to eat it for lunch the next day. This is bound to be one of our favorite recipes. Thanks!"
122878,91880,5/8/2007,5,"This pozole is very flavorful, fast and easy to prepare.  The crockpot seems to be the ideal vessel for making many soups and stews and this was no exception. After the pozole was done, I put it in the refrigerator to meld the flavors.  The only change I made to this recipe was to add a full 32 oz. can of drained/rinsed hominy as that's what I had in the available; it's just awesome. Thanks for another goodie NurseDi!"
31331,35984,4/10/2003,5,I clicked on this recipe because I liked the name.  Moose shrimp?  LOL!!!  I made my first batch of Moose Shrimp last night and served it along with bacon wrapped grilled filet mignon for our 5th wedding anniversary.  Hubby liked it so much that it guaranteed me a lifetime of anniversaries!  Simply delicious with just enough spice to make your mouth happy.  Thanks Millie!
63128,53272,8/30/2003,0,"I HIGHLY recommend using diced potatoes instead of pasta because I have never tried it with pasta (I had altered it for a contest, naively assuming it would work).  "
66008,53272,3/23/2007,5,"decided to make this recipe at the end of RSC#9, as a hidden gem from RSC #3. I now live in Chicago where Italian beef and sausage are popular. This was a very tasty soup! I was worried when putting it together because there was no salt or pepper. However, between the saltiness of the broth and the spiciness of the sausage there was no other spice needed. It definitely has a kick to it. I was also pleased at how easily it went together. For the rest of my family, I think I will try it with a mild Italian Sausage the next time. Thanks for a good recipe, Picholine!"
101823,74830,9/29/2004,5,"I loved these sprouts!  the butter/lemon glaze is just right and the cashews add the perfect sweetness/saltiness to the dish.  Brussels sprouts are one of our favorite dishes, and we will be making these again."
37636,74830,11/30/2004,5,"Simple, but very nice! I think the cashews are the secret to this recipe, as they give the brussels sprouts a nice nutty flavor. I did season these with some compound herb butter I made- enjoy these a lot! Thanks for posting."
103809,74830,11/25/2005,4,I took this to Thanksgiving dinner and everyone enjoyed them.  They were easy to make but the cashews and glaze made them special.
37779,74830,3/18/2007,4,"I steamed these a little longer because I prefer brussel sprouts more tender than crisp. The slight tartness of the lemon-butter glaze with the salty cashews was a good counterpoint to the flavor of the sprouts. Cheers for another quick, healthy side dish. Thanks."
146187,74830,11/5/2007,5,"These are amazing!  Who'da thought brussels sprouts with cashews!?  We like our sprouts ""shaved"", so I sliced them up really thin before lightly steaming them. I then browned them in the butter and added some chopped garlic with the lemon juice (about 1TBSP).  Once the garlice softened, tossed in the cashews & served.  DEFINITELY a keeper!  Thanks for sharing Bergy! I know I can count on your recipes!"
29196,74830,6/3/2009,4,"We enjoyed these thanks Bergy-the sweet, salty crunch of the cashews worked well in the dish. I might shred and stir fry my sprouts next time so the nuts get more evenely distributed through the finished dish."
133822,86858,3/19/2004,5,"Excellent recipe, my husband loved it a lot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
125773,86858,6/6/2004,5,"Great recipe, It was very easy to prepare. I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used a can of tomato soup. I did omit the salt. This recipe is a keeper for quick dinner."
132368,86858,7/7/2004,5,"This recipe is so good. Everyone thought that it was even better than my grandma\'s
goulash recipe!!"
82507,86858,9/2/2004,5,"Couldn't stop eating.  A little too much soy sauce, according to my wife.  Next time maybe just two Tbs.  Easy and delicious."
162958,86858,9/14/2004,5,I loved this recipe:I only used two Tbl of soy- and doubled the pasta to a whole cup:  Awesome is all I can say. and easy too
60989,86858,9/23/2004,5,"This is awesome. It come together very easily, smells wonderful and tastes great. I used a tablespoon less of soy sauce and it was still well seasoned. I easily doubled this recipe. Thanks!"
123865,86858,9/25/2004,4,This recipe was very good and will be made again. I did add extra garlic but other than that followed the directions exactly. Thanks for sharing.
29405,86858,4/19/2005,4,"Nice recipe. I cooked my onion, pepper and garlic with my ground beef. I added hungarian paprika and a can of diced tomatoes with chili seasonings. I used shell macaroni. My husband really liked this dish."
83847,86858,4/24/2005,5,"I prepared this with a tin of crushed tomatoes instead of the soup and added a splash of homemade tomato sauce (ketchup). The family loved it and so did I. Will definetely become a regular around here. 
Many thanks"
213547,86858,6/28/2005,5,"Loved it, I couldn't have asked for better and so quickly!"
205753,86858,7/25/2005,4,just made it and it was a hit!!! used ground turkey instead of beef and used hot pepper flakes instead of sweet   but it still went well. served it with garlic toast too. we'll  make it again
147107,86858,8/22/2005,4,"The picture that's posted doesn't do this dish justice....it is VERY good and perfect for a teenage boy, to fill him up. Super simple and very filling...I'll be making this one again....thanks for a great recipe."
243905,86858,10/11/2005,5,"Wow this is great!  I used 1 1/2 cups of elbow macaroni.  To make it easy to put away, before adding the cheese I transfered it all to a caserole dish.  I melted the cheese by putting the dish in the oven and using the broiler. 

Excellent recipe that's relatively cheap to make and tastes quite good!"
68960,86858,1/29/2006,4,Very good family meal and for ease of cooking it was definitely a 5*. I used about 1 1/2 cups of baby shell pasta that I found in Coles and added an extra 1 cup of water at step 5. I didn't feel it needed extra salt with the soy being enough. A great recipe to add extra  veggies to. This time I included a couple of finely chopped zucchini. Would be great to freeze. Thanks for posting.
166711,86858,3/28/2006,5,"I screwed this recipe all up and it's still VERY good!  I intended to make Mock Chop Suey, but realized after the meat defrosted that I forgot to buy vegetables this week.  I still wanted a ground beef dish with rice and found this recipe.  I had no green peppers and had a headache so I didn't feel like chopping an onion.  I used onion flakes and pre-chopped garlic from a jar.  I browned the meat with the onion flakes and garlic.  After draining the fat, I added the water and soup, but I did not add soy sauce.  I started pouring before I realized that the bottle in my hand was worcesteshire and not soy sauce.  Doh!  So at that point I added pepper and salt (I wasn't going to use salt with the soy sauce).  Then I added the rice. Again, my headache impaired my judgment.  Take my advice: Follow the recipe and do NOT add the rice until after the mixture has simmered!  The rice soaked up the water too quickly and my dinner started to burn.  Luckily I caught it just in time before it was completely ruined.  I added more water and let it simmer until the rice was cooked.  I used only parmesan cheese - no Velveeta.  Despite all of my mistakes, it tasted really good!  And my headache was gone after I ate! Coincidence?  I look forward to making this again - correctly.  Although I did like the worcesteshire sauce, so I'll probably keep that in..."
172114,86858,10/4/2006,5,"This was really delicious, and so easy to make.  I doubled the green pepper and macaroni, and it was really good.  I think next time I will try using cheddar instead of the velveeta."
309967,86858,12/11/2006,5,This deserves 100 stars!!! My husband and baby loved it. I didn't have velveeta cheese so i used cheddar. Also used  3tbs dark amoy soya sauce. Loved it. Thank you for sharing.
344716,86858,12/24/2006,5,"anything i can get my kids to eat deserves 10 stars. haha. i added some corn to it, just for a vegetable and they didnt even notice! thanks for posting. :)"
142878,86858,1/29/2007,5,"Yum gbmc3, this was deelish!  I added some curry powder and it worked really well.  Thanks for posting!"
449290,86858,2/12/2007,5,"Home with a headcold and a house full of men working on our remodel.  Lunch was fast approaching but luckily I found this quick and tasty recipe to make for the hungry crowd.  Doubled it up and added in corn as someone else had suggested.  I too didn't use velveta, but used cheddar cheese instead.  The only ""error"" I made was cooking up the rice beforehand instead of throwing it in uncooked into the pot to simmer - but it turned out great and every last bit was devoured.  It's a keeper!"
210117,86858,3/1/2007,5,"The flavor is definitely 5 STARS!!! I, like others used just 2 tablespoons of Soya sauce.  What I don't understand is how there could be 6 servings, not only because it is so good, but because it truly did not make that much for us.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong or what but I will for sure add more macaroni and water next time.  Thanks for this delicious dish."
244502,86858,3/30/2007,4,"I added corn and more pasta, finished it off in the oven with th cheese on top... great quick recipe :)"
526565,86858,7/18/2007,5,This was very good - I used ground turkey instead of beef and it still turned out great.
114681,86858,8/1/2007,3,This just didn't seem to have a whole lot of flavor to me.  I ended up trying to do a whole lot jazzing towards the end.  Added some mushroom soup.  Finished it up in the crockpot.
461324,86858,8/8/2007,5,"I've made this twice and its absolutely fantastic.  My boyfriend, the picky eater that he is, ate it all up and didn't mind the peppers.  The flavor is great, and its so easy to make.  I halfed the salt b/c of the soy sauce."
558106,86858,8/12/2007,4,It was good and easy to make.  I used cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta and whole grain pasta for a healthier kick. My two year old ate the whole bowl.
149363,86858,8/17/2007,5,"This was easy and surprisingly delicious. Not your average goulash. I used whole grain pasta and some mozzarella cheese, and my whole family loved it. Thanks for posting!"
153627,86858,9/19/2007,5,great easy dish. My wife loves it.
350018,86858,9/26/2007,5,"I made this tonight for dinner, and it was sooooooooooooooo good!!!!!! the only difference was I didn't add the salt due to the soy sauce. This is a keeper, we will make this again.  Thank you for sharing gbmc3!!!!"
614302,86858,10/13/2007,3,"I made this but thought that the amount of macaroni was off. According to this recipe 1/2 cup is only 4 oz which is equal to 4 servings. We put in about a cup and with 4 of us eating had some left over. I also thought it needed more zing, and put in some hungarian paprika and more pepper. So I think it is a good start but can be improved on for us."
616686,86858,10/28/2007,5,"Just cooked it it was great!!  Added more macaroni and garlic salt(didn't use as much soya)!!
Thanks!!"
156901,86858,1/8/2008,4,"Great recipe, made this last night with the following changes: used approx 2 lb. ground beef, added fresh mushrooms with the onions and garlic, omitted the Grn. Pepper, added two 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes, used two cups of macaroni,a Tbs. of paprika and cheddar chs instead of velveeta.  Very easy and good too, how can you beat that?"
49168,86858,2/10/2008,5,Awesome with ingredients on hand.  No green pepper in the house so I just left it out.  We like the macaroni version.  Thanks for posting!
764128,86858,5/26/2008,1,"I was surprised how many people found this delicious...I found it rather bland.  Added ketchup, mustard, worstershire and more pasta (and water).  It was still only okay.  The tomato soup was probably the recipe killer for me.  Should have used canned tomatoes."
97780,86858,8/27/2008,3,I tried this desperate for a quick easy -don't feel like going to the store -meal.  Every one of my children turned up their noses when I put it on the table but liked it when they gave it a chance.  Next time I would use 2 T. soy sauce and 1 T. worchestershire and at least twice as much maccaroni.  I think it was the addition of the velveeta that saved the day for me. I'll definately keep this in mind for next time I'm in the same situation but would probably not use it for a pre-planned meal.
635868,86858,12/10/2008,0,"Omitted the bell pepper as I did not have any . Used cheddar / marble cheese . Used a smaller macaroni ( Ditalini ) 

Recipe was GREAT ! Tasted alot like hamburger helper :)"
709548,86858,12/29/2008,4,"This was good.  I started the receipe out exactly as posted, but to me the sauce didn't have enough flavor so I added some mustard powder, balsamic vinegar and italian seasoning.  It turned out really good.  Thank you for the recipe."
617153,86858,5/12/2009,5,This recipe is excellent! I prepared this for my family with both macaroni noodles and with rice and my family couldn't get enough of it. I switched things up a bit and added an onion/red pepper mix instead of the chopped onion and green pepper and it was a tasty twist.
68605,86858,7/12/2009,2,"I'm sorry gbmc3 and other fans, but this had too much soy sauce (I used ""light"" soy sauce and no salt).  I only added 4 teaspoons, and the smell and taste was overwhelming.  I used rice...it probably would've been better with macaroni.  Just a little too strong on the soy end."
26535,86858,11/7/2009,5,"this was REALLY yummy!!  my dear dear boyfriend was a bit skeptical at first when i told him what i was making...needless to say, he devoured it...then finished off the leftovers the next day!  the flavor of this is so tasty, yet a little unusual (maybe cuz of the soy sauce).  i didn't have a green pepper so i left that out, i also only used about 1 tbsp of soy sauce (which to me was plenty), and i used a full cup of macaroni, and instead of adding a can of water, i used a can of beef broth which really enhanced the flavor of the meat...then i topped it off with shredded cheddar (again, that's what i had). to me the beauty of this recipe is that this meal really is made with simple ingredients that you almost always have on hand...nothing fancy.  we loved it and i'll definitely be making it again!  thanks for a fast yummy EASY recipe!  :-)"
1418504,86858,11/26/2009,5,"Very Good!!! I followed this receipe exactly even with the 3 Tbsp of Kikkoman Soya sauce and I thought it was fine I think if you use a different brand of Soya you are going to get a different taste since all soya's taste differently.  My kid's gobbled it up so it is definately kid approved.  The only thing I did different is dice up(finely) celery and mushrooms since I have a hard time of getting one of my kid's to eat vegetables I try to hide them where I can.  This was very good the first day, it was fabulous left over.  It reminds me of a homemade hamburger helper but better and better for you."
446192,86858,2/3/2010,5,I must admit...I was skeptical at first BUT then that all changed when I dug in!!! This is AMAZING!!! I used orzo pasta and added a little more water as others suggested and it turned out great. Thanks for an easy night recipe that can be made in 30 minutes.
461887,86858,2/16/2010,5,"Delicious recipe. I have made this many times now, and have developed a few changes. The 3 Tbsp. of soy sauce made the goulash a bit too salty for us, so now I only add about 1 Tbsp. I also use a can of tomato sauce, rather than tomato soup. I use a box of macaroni and cheese for the pasta and add in the powdered cheese, instead of Velveeta (less fat).  Thanks for the great recipe!"
884411,86858,3/24/2010,5,"Easy, quick and yummy!  I used ground venison, reduced the soy to 1 Tbl., added a touch of basil, and topped with shredded cheddar.  Wonderful dinner and even picky kids were pleased.  Thanks so much."
768828,86858,2/2/2011,0,"My DH had three helpings - so I'd say this rated at least five stars.  I used half a box of shells and cheese and half of the cheese package (about 1 cup of shells.)  Also didn't use the parmesan cheese as I thought there was enough cheese in with the shells & cheese.  Thanks for a great, easy to make recipe."
266955,86858,3/10/2011,4,"I couldn't get it to stay moist enough after I added the noodles!  I added 1/2 a cup 3 times, but that probably was more user error than recipe, lol!  What didnt burn was very good, even the kids liked it.<br/>Thanks!"
222564,24554,11/4/2007,5,Wonderful even without prosciutto!
970862,86858,3/17/2011,0,"ONE OF MY FAVS!!!!. i add a can of corn, a can of diced tomatoes, and a can of tomato paste, then serve with saltine crackers. LOVE I     p.s.   I precooked my noodles befor adding them"
330889,86858,7/19/2011,5,"This is REALLY good!  It's so easy to make and it tastes fantastic.  The only changes I made were that I used a pound of ground beef/pork that was left over after I made meatballs.  I didn't add any salt because the soy sauce adds enough saltiness.  And I used about 1 1/2 cups of elbow macaroni and just melted shredded cheddar over it.  Seriously, I could eat this every day.  It's so easy on the wallet, easy to make, and definitely easy to eat!"
494084,86858,11/1/2012,4,This was pretty good.  It is an interesting flavor...kind of unlike anything I've eaten before.  What I really liked was that it is so modifiable.  Tonight I threw in half a bag of frozen vegi's but I imagine you could do just about whatever you felt like.  Thanks for the recipe gbmc3....
1802367921,86858,1/17/2014,5,This was delicious!!!&lt;br/&gt;There was about a spoonful left over. Great flavor and very easy to make. Will definitely make this again!!
45272898,86858,1/21/2014,5,My family LOVED this recipe. I followed recipe exactly and it was great. I asked my 14 year old son what he wanted for dinner tonight and he asked for this. He calls it the &quot;homemade hamburger helper&quot;. He has never had hamburger helper so he has no idea that this is WAAAY better! It is cheap to make and really filling so a little goes a long way. A new family favorite.
1616592,86858,10/1/2014,5,"Loved it! I read the review so limited the soy sauce to 1 tablespoon, didn&#039;t add salt, and used cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta cheese. It reminded me of my mom&#039;s bachelor&#039;s hash (not sure what was used for tomatoes but it included canned mushrooms and chez wiz instead of Velveeta). This may have even been better the next day for lunch too after the flavours had time to sit."
1802667833,86858,1/21/2016,5,This is a new easy favourite for my family. We use macaroni instead of riceand I just shred up some cheese and mix it right it. My picky family really enjoy this one and I will keep coming back to it!!
2000810575,86858,2/6/2016,5,"My family LOVED this goulash! Even my hubby, who kinda snarled and said, &quot;I don&#039;t like goulash&quot; had 2 helpings the first night and then ate it for breakfast &amp; lunch the following day! When my daughter was little she asked my mom, &quot;Nana, will you cook me some of your yummy eyelash&quot;! It took us a few minutes to realize she meant goulash. I hadn&#039;t made goulash since my mom was killed over 10 yrs ago, and I&#039;m glad I picked this recipe. The only changes I made was to use tomato sauce instead of soup and adding shredded cheddar and an Italian cheese mix on top of each serving, instead of in the pan. (popping each into the microwave just long enough to melt the cheese). It was delicious and I definitely won&#039;t be waiting 10 yrs to make it again! Thanks for the recipe!"
2001175794,86858,9/19/2016,4,"I didn't tweak this very much so I think I can still review it. I only put in two tablespoons of the soy sauce, used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup and added beef broth in place of the water. I also put in two cups of macaroni instead of just 1/2 cup. I really didn't care for the soy sauce in it. I hope it improves for tomorrow as it made a bunch!"
2001348474,86858,6/16/2017,3,This recipe is always good any way it's made.
2001010400,86858,7/12/2017,4,I wanted to make this to use up some ground beef and I love pasta so it looked good. I discovered I didn't have any tomato soup so I used mushroom soup instead as well as some sliced fresh mushrooms. Did everything else like the recipe indicates. Loved it.
2001722458,533575,9/20/2017,5,This surprisingly worked out really good 5/5.
53932,108366,4/29/2007,5,Delicious indeed.  The blue cheese and walnuts were very good addition to the spinach.  I would more finely chop the walnuts next time just to have them more evenly mixed throughout.
230102,120865,11/5/2005,5,"This was wonderful!!  It turned out very moist and was high-rising as promised. It was easy to make (I'm not Martha Stewart) and created a minimum of mess.  I made Lemon Butter Sauce for Cake #87610 and it was truly the proverbial ""Icing On The Cake!""  Thank you for taking the time to post such a nice recipe!"
570804,120865,4/30/2008,5,I love this gingerbread not only for the taste but for the ease of preparation.  I have substituted applesauce for half the oil with excellent results. Thanks for subitting.
101823,129925,8/1/2005,4,"I prepared this using cantaloupe and honeydew melon.  I didn't have any oranges on hand and omitted that zest.  I like the flavor of the dressing, but my husband wasn't as big of fan.  He felt the ginger was too strong."
104295,129925,8/15/2005,5,"We really enjoyed this!  I remembered, as I was putting this together, that I was out of ginger!  So I used candied ginger which gave it a really nice flavor.  We had this for dessert (with no ice cream) and we loved it.  Think the sauce would be good on other fruit as well.  "
176124,129925,1/27/2006,5,"This made a great summer dessert. The zingy warmth of the ginger complimented the sweetness of the rockmelon (cantaloupe). I didn't have a lime so doubled the orange zest, then cheated by adding a dash of lime extract. I heated the mix on the stovetop which made it caramelise slightly. This super quick recipe was an easy way to turn simple fruit into a ""dessert"". "
131126,129925,6/19/2006,4,I liked this simple dessert and thought the flavors were excellent with an Asian meal. The ginger is bit strong. I will reduce it some next time.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!  
67656,129925,6/24/2006,5,"Accepted your invitation to try this on other fruits and used a combination of apricots, plums and strawberries.  I'm a little shy about the sweetness of honey but the lemon and ginger really kept the sweetness down and offered a nice contrast. I served mine on top of plain yogurt for breakfast and garnished with chopped crystalized ginger. Thanks!"
223979,129925,6/25/2006,5,This was so easy and so quick to put together!  It is really refreshing.  I love trying all these new recipes on Zaar!  I will serve this many times this summer!  
58104,129925,6/27/2006,5,This was delish and easy! Had as a dessert but would be great with some grilled tuna.
107135,129925,6/29/2006,5,good stuff dee
88099,129925,7/12/2006,5,This made for a lovely light lunch.  Very quick and easy to put together.  Thanks
269521,129925,7/12/2006,5,This was so good!   Forget just dessert . . . made it my entire lunch today!  I love anything with ginger.  I did not have orange zest so added a little orange marmalade and cut back a little on the honey!  Wonderful!   Thanks for sharing.
65197,129925,7/12/2006,5,"YUMMY!!  I love the taste of ginger! I can see the combo of ginger and zest on several different fruits!!
Thank you!"
133174,129925,7/13/2006,4,"I loved the combination of lime and orange zest with the gingerrot.  I did reduce the amount of honey by half and drizzled the mixture over a bowl of melon, peaches and bananas.  This was served for breakfast and topped with some plain yogurt."
80353,129925,7/14/2006,4,Very nice.  I served this for breakfast with Greek yoghurt and it was delicious.
579298,129925,4/6/2010,5,"Very very good combination of flavors. I enjoyed mine with a dollop of yogurt, like many of the previous reviewers suggested - and I froze the leftovers: I am eager to see how it turns out! Thanks for the great recipe!"
855685,129925,8/26/2010,4,"This was good, but I used a micro plane for the ginger and lime - that was too harsh.  Also try adding a bit of cinamon -picks things up nicely."
316194,129925,5/12/2011,5,"This was a simple and delicious dish!  Its cool, lime-infused taste went very well with the spicy Mexican entree we had for dinner. The whole family liked it. Thanks for a great recipe Littleturtle :)"
222564,162515,7/23/2014,5,"Wonderful! Love Halva. I did not separate the eggs, being lazy, turned out very good all the same! Oh, and I upped the sugar to 1/2 cup."
585449,349788,7/8/2009,4,This was great! I added mushrooms too and this will definitely be something I make over and over!! YUM!
204024,212669,10/14/2007,5,"This fudge recipe is great. It is very smooth and creamy. I would definitely make this again. Thanks for a good recipe. Made for Fall PAC 07

Added.  My DH took this to his work.  His boss and boss wife thought it was the best fudge they had ever had.  Boss Wife is very picky.  Boss wants my to give wife the recipe."
487279,256978,5/14/2008,5,"Perfect!!  I made it as it's written and wouldn't change a thing (except I'd like to try it with the lemon thyme which I don't have).  The green beans go well with it, and I love the way the oil and tuna make up most of the dressing.  Used barley.
Light and filling meal, thanks!"
163112,274368,1/5/2008,5,"I've been craving polenta so when I found this among your recipes, I was thrilled!  This is easy & it turned out perfectly.  I needed no extra water.  Made for the 1/08 Aussie Swap."
527607,274368,1/25/2008,5,polenta is heavenly and this is a great technique for making it.  Served it with a rib sticking stew :)
205783,274368,6/1/2008,4,Thanks mersaydees for posting this.  Made for ZWT4.  I have another recipe that I use (by Anna del Conte) but thought I'd give this a go.  It made a lovely polenta (and the tip about using a whisk at the start is inspired - no lumps) but for me the difference was the butter - Anna's recipe uses olive oil & I think I just prefer that better.  This is a good standby though and I would definitely use it again if I was out of olive oil.  Thanks for posting.
37449,274368,6/25/2008,5,Very nice! I had this for breakfast this morning. I cut the recipe back a third. Perfect! Thanks!
452940,274368,7/29/2008,4,I made this for breakfast (like grits) with some eggs and bacon. I loved the butter flavor in this dish and your instructions are spot on.
103876,274368,2/24/2009,5,This polenta turned out wonderful!  Soft and creamy.  Perfect comfort food!
50969,275555,11/11/2010,4,"I made this recipe on 11/10/10 as part of mine and SO's dinner. After reading over the recipe and noticing the pancake batter I was thinking, ""Well why not give it a shot ?"". I followed the recipe as it was written,even frying it in a skillet :).But the oil must not have not been hot enough, because the coating kept falling off. But as far as the taste of the chicken, it wasn't too bad at all. Very moist, tender, and flavorful. Thanks for posting and, "" Keep Smiling :) """
538524,280085,4/12/2008,5,ooh this was an interesting combination of flavors!!! it was really good!! i'll probably be making this again soon!
28177,309387,7/13/2008,5,"I was searching ingredients to use up some buttermilk.  Imagine my surprise when I found this recipe with all it's crazy ingredients & I had them all on hand!  Well, I didn't have any cake flour left, so I used bread flour that I sifted twice.  Everyone loved these muffins.  They were moist & very flavorful.  They had a beautiful balance between sweet & tangy with the ginger (I used homemade crystallized ginger), cranberries & white chocolate.  Be sure to spray the muffin tins with non-stick cooking spray first.  Since it wasn't noted I sprayed 6 cups & left 6 dry.  I used a 2-1/2 inch ice cream scoop & one scoop filled each muffin cup perfectly.  There was exactly enough batter for 12 cups.  I baked mine for 20 minutes & they tested done with the toothpick, but after cutting one open, it was a tad bit moist, I think they could have gone another 3 minutes in the oven.  We still ate them immediately with no regrets!  Thanks for posting this, Elly.  I've already forwarded the recipe to my mom."
204024,309387,7/28/2009,5,These are ingredients that I don't usually have on hand.  I was able to get just what I needed at the bulk food bins at the grocery store.  I am glad I made these. There is a great blend of flavors and textures in these muffins.  Made for Summer Comfort Cafe.
135470,309387,7/30/2009,4,"This are chock full of goodness! I used almonds and half white half semi sweet choc, and made them mini muffins - they cooked in about 15 mins. Love the cranberry and choc. together.
Made for the Comfort Cafe July 09"
1025608,349788,1/13/2010,3,"My husband and I both thought this was a little bland. I did the zucchini, onions, tomatoes, mushroom, some garlic, parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. But it definitely needs something."
57437,349788,3/12/2010,5,I have made this twice so far and love it! Passes it on to several friends on ww too. I like to use the mushrooms and add garlic to this. Last time I added some yellow squash. Very easy to put together and great that it is so low in points. Even my sons liked this recipe. I am sure to make this over and over as there are so many ways one could make it using different veggies. I put this in a square pan to bake and cut in four at 3 pts a piece. Thanks for sharing.
93726,433774,1/6/2012,5,We really enjoyed this!
15892,436917,5/15/2011,4,"I just HAD to monkey with this! Sorry, it's what I do. I subbed one cup of chicken stock with sherry and added a healthy dose of dried thyme.  I was hoping to use up some leeks and mushrooms on their last leg, and then freeze it. So I've not yet added the cream; I'll do that when I thaw and reheat.  This smells wonderful, and was very easy to make. I'll let you know how it thaws / tastes once I get there. Thanks, Abby Girl!"
280271,489598,3/22/2013,5,I&#039;ve made plenty of cucumber salads...this is the first one that used mint...I love it...it&#039;s really refreshing and adds a wonderful taste...thanks for posting it...made for Spring PAC 2013f =)
1803050408,518015,8/19/2014,5,"This was terrific.  the Polenta was creamy and rich, and the Turkey was tangy and Flavorful.  When i tried this dish i couldn&#039;t stop eating it, the two components of Polenta and Turkey would have stood on there own, but together it was really incredible.  I would have this again any day.  putting the recipe together was not hard at all and the results were great."
1803050779,518015,8/19/2014,5,Great Dish.....
1803051069,518015,8/19/2014,5,This recipe was a big hit!
1803055453,518015,8/20/2014,5,Good to the last bite......
1803056088,518015,8/21/2014,5,"This recipe is amazing! This dish has become my favorite food, which I would eat everyday, if possible. The creamy mascarpone polenta is a subtle contrast to the tangy A1 sauce. The savory turkey blends perfectly with the sauce and polenta."
1803058579,518015,8/22/2014,5,"As we say in Texas, this meal would make the rabbit hug a hound. I don&#039;t think this recipe would serve 8. I had 3 helpings all by myself."
1803062017,518015,8/23/2014,5,"My wife and I tried this and though I&#039;m not a good cook, it was fairly easy and very delicious and we will definitely have it again in the near future."
1803061344,518015,8/26/2014,0,The only thing wrong with this meal is I couldn&#039;t stop till i thought id bust. yep 3 servings later it was love at first bite  the Polenta and the turkey realty complement each other 5 yummms
1198627,518015,8/26/2014,5,Super Yummy! Who new A-1 was not just for steaks.
1803076811,518015,8/27/2014,5,Keep the leftovers. This dish is even good re-heated.
1803072039,518015,8/28/2014,5,The mixing it was a nice suggestion. Great recipe.
1803080660,518015,8/30/2014,5,This was a SUPER meal. Everyone should try it.
1803101057,518015,9/3/2014,5,"Someone made this dish for me, and it was really good. GOT to learn how to make it."
1803101652,518015,9/3/2014,5,"I had this dish at a company potluck, and it was terrific. Now I have the recipe, and can&#039;t wait to make it for my family."
1803108520,518015,9/6/2014,5,"Had this at a potluck. All the dishes were good, but this one received the &quot;Best Entree&quot; award."
1803109127,518015,9/6/2014,5,"My girlfriend and I prepared this for my family get together. Now my family wants me to marry&lt;br/&gt;Carmen so they can continue being served this delightful, creamy, delicious dish. If we do get married, this will be a holiday favorite. Kudos to the chef who created this recipe."
121985,33861,9/3/2004,4,"I left out the jalepeno pepper becuase i didn't want too much heat and used a green bell pepper instead.  This turned out great!  I served it with taco's for dinner last night and my boyfriend was very impressed.  I made salads for lunch today and used it as a salad dressing/garnish.  YUM!  Thanks for the easy recipe, I will be using again!"
160378,33861,9/20/2004,4,"I liked this recipe but i used habaneros instead of the jalapenos that this recipe called for, all in all it was a great recipe. My lips are still burning."
407625,24554,11/15/2007,4,"Definitely rich, but yum-my, even using old-school US bacon instead of prosciutto"
32253,33861,9/29/2004,5,"  This is a wonderful addition to my recipe collection.  I didn't have fresh jalapenos so I used the pickled ones, it turned out great.  I also added 1 tablespoon olive oil for flavor, but it wasn't necessary.  I recipe is wonderful as is.  Thanks, I'll be sharing it with friends and family."
231132,33861,8/22/2007,5,"I had to leave out the jalapenos because of the tastes of the people that would be eating this, but what a great, fresh dish!  I actually quadrupled the recipe and took it to a birthday party untested.  It was a smash hit!"
133174,33861,9/2/2007,5,An excellent recipe for Pico de Gallo.  This was made using fresh from the garden ingredients.  Wonderful!
475706,33861,9/4/2007,5,"Served this with tacos and Spanish rice. This 1 gets 5 stars for flavor and ease. Tastes just like the pico we were served in Mexico, just a little milder. I used a serrano pepper (jalapeno too hot for me) and added a dash of garlic and cumin powder. It was so quick to whip this together. Perfection!"
122878,33861,10/8/2007,5,"This is an awesome pico de gallo. I prepared it to be served with pollo asada and homemade refried bean and tortillas. I followed the directions exactly as written and used the 2 jalapenos and roma tomatoes. Thanks Sharlene for sharing. I'll be making this regularly.

10/8/07: There's not enough I can say to applaude this pico de gallo.  I just made a batch to accompany tonight's chile verde.  This time I used large salad tomatoes finely chopped and white onion.  I also used one very large pickled jalapeno, seeded and chopped finely.  This is just the bomb and so easy to make.  A big thanks!!"
650938,33861,1/5/2008,5,I've made this twice now and the flavor is PERFECT!!!
204705,33861,3/3/2008,5,I made this for my husband and he loved it. It was my first time making pico and it turned out great. I did use a red onion instead of the sweet. Will be making again!
335277,33861,4/29/2008,5,"With sweet Texas onions on sale, now seemed the perfect time to try this. And boy am I glad I did. Very basic ingredients and very easy to put to together. I made this along side refried bean burritos and tortillia chips. A wonderfully fresh side. Only change was to use lemon juice instead of lime. Will be making this again."
704950,33861,6/23/2008,5,Wonderful pico!!!  This is perfectly seasoned and will definitely use this recipe again and again. !Muchas Gracias!
296112,33861,7/16/2008,5,SIMPLY AWESOME!!! I made this to go with Carnitas (Authentic)Recipe #127058 and it was fabulous! The only thing I added was garlic (love that garlic LOL) I will be making this to go with the Carnitas recipe listed above a lot. Thanks sooooo much for sharing.
287084,33861,8/12/2008,5,I loved this recipe... definitely one of my faves!
811564,33861,8/25/2008,5,I halved everything and it still worked wonderfully (no surprise). Loved it every time I've made it. Works best if you let it sit for a bit so the flavors can meld.
663997,33861,8/21/2009,5,"Delish!
Served with nachos and my husband was excited.  Thanks, Justine
Update:  My family is now getting mad when I buy store salsa.  They only want your recipe. :)"
363055,33861,8/22/2009,5,"Wow!!  This is the best fresh salsa I have ever tasted.  Used fresh tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos from my garden...will make a lot more of this."
241242,33861,6/24/2010,5,Fantastic!  I like it with a little Green Pepper too.
653438,33861,12/14/2010,5,Awesome!  I made this as written except for adding some really minced garlic...definately a keeper.  Thank you.  Made for Let's P-A-R-T-Y tag game 2010.
267665,33861,6/12/2011,5,"Great recipe, easy and simple! first time I made it I used purple onion DON""T DO IT! much too strong, but that was my fault:) Thanks for posting Sharlene~W"
1098889,33861,8/7/2011,0,"Excellent pico!  I have realized I do not like cooked salsa (the kind that comes in a jar).  Fresh is the only way for me!  This recipe is super-easy to make, and the flavors are great."
476538,33861,9/5/2011,5,"I have been looking for a good salsa type recipe for my spanish husband... and then it occurred to me that he might not like salsa but be looking for more of a pico type dish. Needless to say, we tried this one and it was fantastic. I halved the recipe just in case he didn't like it, and I put a little less onion in it and it was still fantastic. The next time I make it, I will make it as is in the recipe and probably double it. I had no idea he would eat the whole bowl! It was great! Thanks!"
91584,33861,10/19/2011,5,Excellent! Very fresh tasting.
28455,42552,10/10/2002,5,"This is great, easy and yummy, just what I like.. thanks! Donna"
56009,42552,10/15/2002,5,My family totally loved this recipe.  It was very simple.  I used a white sharp cheese rather than cheddar and I added a small can of pea's with carrots.  It was great!
36988,42552,10/18/2002,4,"I finally got around to making this yesterday for dinner. I really liked it although I think I would add peas and sliced carrots to the mixture next time I make it. My husband thought it was ""bland"" and my son didnt like it at all! Too bad as I thought it was wonderful...."
42290,42552,11/2/2002,4,"This was nice and easy! I added a box of thawed chopped spinach (squeezed dry), some sliced mushrooms, a few dashes of Frank's Red Hot and sliced swiss cheese (all I had!) instead. Very good!"
52800,42552,11/3/2002,5,"I loved this recipe. I used Pillsbury already made pie crusts, for time saving purposes. The cream of potato soup and cheese added great flavor to the hamburger, while the onion and green peppers provided some nice texture. This is quick, easy, tasty, and a great meal for during the week."
60020,42552,1/10/2003,5,This was an awesome hamburger pie. I used Pillsbury's refrigerated pie crust dough. I cut little slits in the top crust to let the steam vent. Turned out perfectly. Very hearty well seasoned filling. Simple old-fashioned comfort food. Thanks Country Granny Judy.
199418,42552,3/1/2005,5,"This was really good - I did add a little bit of worcestershire sauce and cayenne pepper to spice it up a little bit (my DH likes things spicier, it would have been fine as is for me)"
875207,42552,10/26/2008,4,"Good recipe. Kids loved it. Very easy. I made it ahead, put in the frig and baked it right before dinner."
1856666,42552,5/25/2012,5,"For as simple as this was, it was amazingly good. And you can play around with the ingredients. I used ground chuck because I found that on sale. I added fresh mushrooms, really big ones,that I quartered, added those after I browned the beef , onions and green pepper.I probably used a little bit more cheese than what was called for.I also used refrigerated pie dough which made it easier. And I added garlic. <br/> My husband said it tasted like an Upper Michigan Pastie, which we love. When I got home from work there was none left, I wished I would've made 2 ! I will be making this again very soon."
80063,53630,4/9/2003,4,"Recipe turned out very well.  Easy to make.  I did have to substitute soy sauce for the Oyster Sauce since I couldn't obtain any locally.  I also used marsala wine cooking wine since I was out of rice wine.  It was delicious.
One slight correction, the broccoli is not part of the marinade."
90626,53630,6/19/2003,0,"This recipe was terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wouldn't advise anyone out there to make it. "
95496,53630,7/23/2003,5,"I've made similar recipes that went well after cooking it a few times, so I chose this one to work with.  I added more ingredients (onion, mushrooms, garlic, etc)and substituded white cooking wine for rice wine.  It worked very well and I particularly like how the broccoli turned out!

After getting used to this type of cooking, particularly the cornstarch sauce getting cooked into the ingredients, it works very well and tastes great!"
108495,53630,11/15/2005,5,tasted just like take-out
672870,53630,1/14/2008,4,"I also thought this recipe was delicious and tasted similar to take-out.  I followed the recipe as written, except that I used white cooking wine instead of rice wine, and ground ginger since I didn't have any fresh.  I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic when I added the broccoli back into the wok, and I added about 1-2 tbsp of soy sauce to the ""seasoning"" mixture.  This was a delicious recipe - thanks for posting!"
165933,53630,3/26/2009,4,"This was an easy recipe to put together.  I did add carrots, onions and garlic, just a habit of mine.  Not sure if it tastes like take-out, I've never had beef and broccoli as take-out but it sure was good!  Thanks."
175124,187850,8/7/2007,4,"This was a very tasty soup. My 2 year old daughter LOVED it. The blend of spices was very nice and the toppings (we used yoghurt, currants, and parsley) made it a bit ""different"" to your everyday soup. I did have to make a change, as I realised at the last minute I had no canned tomatoes. So I used 2 cans of pureed ones, instead. I do think the ""body"" of the crushed ones would've improved this, as the broth was a bit too thin. Next time I think I will also use stock or add a few tsps of stock powder to the water, as did need a lot of salt. I also think some diced carrots would be good in this. I also have to wonder if you could just cook the lentils with the rest of the ingredients, adding a bit of stock or water if needed. That would save a step and probably thicken it up a bit."
169430,187850,11/13/2007,4,Loved the seasonings in this Toni. The cinnamon cooking with the lentils was out of this world aromatic. I thought that the cumin seed and the ground cumin might be a bit strong but it all worked perfectly. I found that the lentils still had a tiny bit of crunch when I ate it. Check them for tenderness before you scoop them into serving bowls. If your a hardcore Meatitarian chopped chicken would not be amiss in this at all.
1525581,187850,1/18/2010,5,Fabulous!!  Easy and great taste.
133174,198139,4/22/2007,4,"This is a really a quick and delicious meal.  I used 16 precooked turkey meatballs that had been frozen.  They were warmed in the oven and then combined with the sauce and simmered as instructed in the recipe.  It was necessary for me to add additional milk.  I don't think that the amount of sauce would support 24 meatballs.  In place of the sour cream, I used plain yogurt.  This was served over Recipe #180273."
47723,198139,4/23/2014,4,"This was good. I did have to double the milk and the nutmeg. I served it over egg noodles. While I wouldn&#039;t say it was as good as made from scratch Swedish meatballs, it was easy because I used frozen meatballs. I liked it, but my wife thought it was just okay."
1671995,198139,8/27/2014,4,"No, it wasn&#039;t as good as from scratch Swedish meatballs, but it was as close as could be expected considering the ingredients. I doubled the milk,  nutmeg &amp; sour cream. Also, I used a whole family sized (26 oz) can of soup. I put everything EXCEPT the meatballs into a skillet &amp; brought to a boil. I added leftover uncooked egg noodles, (about 6 oz)  cooking them for a few minute while zapping the (thawed) meatballs, which I then added to the skillet. I finished according to the recipe, although my cooking time was a few minute less."
2000502639,198139,9/27/2015,5,Super quick and delicious. I used HEB home style meatballs and egg noodles. The kids loved it. I loved it. Very quick and very easy. Bravo!
1900559,198139,10/20/2015,4,The one thing missing that makes these more traditional Swedish meatballs is coffee.  Instant is fine.  It give them a great flavor.
2001533432,198139,5/12/2017,0,I don't understand what is Swedish in this recepy!
169430,204841,1/13/2007,5,I may keep this on hand from now on! It's wonderful. The color is gorgeous and you can put it on anything and I love the amount. It's small enough that you won't have to worry about finding more freezer space. The trick is not to eat the bowlful at once.
58104,210276,2/19/2007,5,Warming rich and comforting!
25455,210276,4/26/2007,3,"I hate to give this such low marks, but it was over the top on chocolate (then again--maybe that isn't such a bad thing).  The flavor was good--and it was RICH.  I cut the recipe in half because chocolate I used was $1/oz. and even then, I only used 3.5 ounce of chocolate for 1 1/2 cups of milk (just over half of what was called for).  It was so heavy on the chocolate even my teenager daughter could only handle a sip before she ""milked"" it down with a couple of cups more milk.  I think what this would be great for is to pour a bit into a cup of hot coffee."
169430,210276,6/30/2007,5,"Oh my! just what the Dr ordered for the 2 days of rain and cold that we have had. Rich, chocolaty and very comforting! To my figuring 12 ounces of chocolate into 4 servings comes out to 3oz per cup so that is what I used. The fact that I simply love bittersweet didn't hurt any. Changes: I used fat free evaporated milk in place of the cream and Splenda for the sugar. I also added a good dash of cinnamon into the steaming pot and skipped the whipped cream."
80353,210276,10/5/2007,5,"Scaled this down to enjoy all by my lonesome today.  It was lovely.  If you scale back, you may want to beat the tiny amount of cream with an immersion blender - I have a special kind of wand that did the trick.  The  dusting of cinnamon over top was a treat."
424680,210276,2/2/2008,5,"Oh, yeah! Just what the chocoholic ordered! I opted out of the whipped cream, just because I usually end up stirring it in, & I didn't want to dilute the chocolate one bit! Absolutely great tasting {I should know, 'cause I drank it all, over a short period of time! Thanks for the posting! Made for Cupid's Choice Beverage Tag Game"
68526,210276,2/11/2008,5,"I halved the recipe and then proceeded to drink it all by my lonesome :)  What a chocolate fix for me!  Thanks for sharing Lainey.
Made for Zaar Stars Tag Game.  Linda"
37449,210276,2/19/2008,5,Oh my! What a chocolate fix I enjoyed! I halved the recipe and drank both cups! Thank you Lainey for a morning treat!
47907,266042,11/18/2007,4,"I made these today and they were very good and very easy to make.  I did have some problems with the bake time.  I put them in for 15 minutes and it was really too long as a couple of them were on the verge of burning.  Next time, I would really watch them starting at about 12 minutes or so.  Except for that, I had no other problems.  I plan to make these again for Christmas.  Thanks for posting!!"
2092716,284065,12/13/2011,4,"This was fun and easy to make! It was a little tricky timing everything and it was much sweeter than anticipated, but it was a huge hit! I put the mixture into martini glasses with a dollop of cool whip and sprinkled it with cocoa powder and chocolate chips for decoration."
424680,323571,10/18/2008,5,"Had a lot of fun making this shake, especially since I don't usually get so fancy in the presentation! Will tell you, though, I doubled the recipe & got 2 nice-sized, satisfying shakes for 2 very appreciative non-alcoholic drinkers! Thanks again, Rita, for a keeper! [Tagged, made & reviewed in This Round's On Me!]"
52448,325024,10/19/2008,5,This made lots of cookies! Found the dough not easy to work with but added some more flour whilst working with it. I did not ice them ...just filled up the cookie tins. They are soft and chewy just like you said!
1004031,325024,10/26/2008,0,"Great recipe right up until I saw the Nutrition Facts!  Wow, talk about killing people with kindness."
900931,325024,12/2/2008,5,"For chef 1004031
Just a note: The Nutrition facts are for 1 dozen cookies so you would have to divide by 12.  Not much different than most of the sugar cookies in this section."
436697,325024,12/3/2008,5,"This is the same recipe I have used for 20 years.  I don't think I would ever use another recipe if you paid me.  I do however prefer to use the hard glaze for the icing, it makes it so much easier to stack them during transporting.  The absolute best cookie for Bake sales, Christmas, Easter, Birthdays and even a great Welcome to the neighborhood gift."
789123,325024,12/6/2008,5,"I did add 1/4 cup more sugar,  added 1/8 teaspoon french lavender essential oil  and 1 T Royal Velvet Lavender Buds from www.blossomfarm.com  was a great hit at the christmas tea I attended last night.  I tried putting a few lavender florets on top but was and over kill of lavender.  Oh for the frosting I used butter and purple food die."
1057319,325024,12/20/2008,4,"These cookies turned out exactly how I wanted them to: very puffy, soft, creamy colored and sweet but not too sweet (perfect match for icing)! Unfortunately the dough was extremely difficult to work with -- very very very sticky! I ended up adding a lot more flour to make the dough even workable and using cutters with narrow parts was nearly impossible. Once I got the consistency right, however, it was smooth sailing. I used http://www.recipezaar.com/Royal-Icing-19250 for the icing - perfecto! Will use this recipe in the future!"
2470494,325024,10/28/2012,1,Disappointing!  We did not like these cookies at all. Soft and doughy but not chewy.  Texture more like gingerbread cookies than sugar cookies The dough was well chilled so we didn't have a problem working with it.  But won't be making these again!
37449,328584,3/6/2011,5,"I enjoyed these deviled eggs! I scaled down the recipe for 4 eggs. I liked the whole grain mustard, gave a nice tang. Thanks! Made for PAC event."
311625,369380,9/11/2009,5,Kids and hubby loved it. Doubled the recipe and had no leftovers. Thanks!
780172,379102,2/19/2010,5,"This was quite easy to make and it was really good. Only thing I might do next time is try and find a more ""healthy"" type of sausage (if one even exists!) Also, I think this would be a great dish for a brunch."
461834,379102,4/5/2010,5,"Wonderful all in one pan breakfast!!  I made one change to it as I didn't add the bell pepper because DS and DH don't like it.  For the potatoes I used refrigerated hash browns, so took the lazy route lol!!  I could see adding mushrooms and cheese and for me I would like the bell pepper as well!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe that all 3 of us enjoyed.  Made for Photo Tag Game."
174096,379102,4/21/2011,5,Delicious!  Can't beat a combo like this.  Thanks for sharing!
126440,379102,4/24/2011,5,Great breakfast!
323186,379102,1/9/2015,5,"This was so good and easy - I made this for dinner and we loved it, a delicious change of pace.  I used a red bellpepper, pork sausage,  added a small gem squash (You said it was ok to add more veggies :) )   and some garlic.  Thoroughly enjoyed this, a real keeper, and comfort food to boot :)  Thank you, made for Consideration Tag Game"
1157312,386633,7/17/2011,5,"This was a real treat.  Mixing it up was easy but I was a little worried at how thick the batter was.  Still, I spread it out in the pan with the spatula and crossed my fingers.  But it rose up perfectly and the zucchini made the cake SO MOIST!  I followed the recipe precisely other than adding about a tsp of cinnamon.  I tasted the batter and just felt like the cinnamon would add just the right aromatic and flavorful touch--and it did.  Don't skimp on the lemon zest here--that really sets off the flavors.  This recipe is a keeper for me.  I am eager to try out some barley flour or other whole-grain flours to beef up the nutritional profile a little.  :)  My boys were dubious about trying the cake due to the zucchini but when they did try it they loved it.  I didn't frost the cake--it was perfect the way it was."
425260,386633,7/12/2012,5,"This was a weird zucchini loaf recipe so I followed the directions to a T (ok, I did add lemon ZEST not RIND).  Absolutely great cake!  Extremely moist, holds its shape, and I can even detect the lemon flavor which is delicious.  I cut the zucchini into small dice and it really worked.  My molasses made the cake dark to a point that it looks chocolate.  It's right on for sweetness."
455641,455565,5/25/2011,5,"Absolutely incredibly delicious!!! It was velvety smooth and the flavor was perfect from the vanilla coffee and rum, yummy. It took a little patience to get mine to unmold, but you could eat it out of the dessert cup too. I couldn't find gelatin leaves or sheets, so I did a lil looking and figured the equivalent to be one envelope of powered unflavored gelatin, and it worked just fine for me. I added the powdered to the hot mixture after it came off the stove, stirred till dissolved, and strained and all like the rest of the recipe. We loved this, thanks so much for sharing! Made for Witchin Kitchen ZWT7!"
222564,455565,8/20/2013,5,"Yumskis! Made with full fat milk, turned out just as delicioso!"
55729,6921,5/16/2004,4,"I used legs (drumsticks) for this recipe. A good balance of flavors. I didn't marinate overnight, but I wish I had, because I would have liked a stronger flavor."
4005,8507,4/22/2001,5,"This is a delicious, healthy and beautiful salad that takes only minutes to prepare.  I look forward to the homegrown tomatoes and basil from my garden."
8000,8507,6/12/2001,5,"Sounds good.  I would mince the basil, and place it directly on the tomatoes."
12756,8507,7/17/2001,5,"This recipe is *awesome*, but here's a nifty little hint:

Instead of regular mozzarella, use buffalo mozzarella.  Add cucumbers to this dish, and spoon a homemade salsa relish (think tomatoes, not heat) on top of the cheese.

A superb little dish!"
16481,8507,8/29/2001,0,"I agree with the other comments (use fresh mozerella, etc.) It's hard to find in some areas. Trader Joe's has it. Italian deli's have it, if you are lucky enough to have one where you live. I just have one suggestion. Drizzle on some Balsamic vinegar along with the olive oil. I travelled all over Italy last summer and ate this salad everywhere. Many places added the Balsamic and it makes a good salad really good!"
17095,8507,8/31/2001,5,This is a great light salad.  Even my children love it.  I like to add a little fresh cracked black pepper to it.
12777,8507,10/20/2001,3,"actually, switching avacado slices for the mozzarella, and adding a homemade french dressing makes it absolutely fabulous, and do use basil."
7308,8507,2/18/2002,4,"I didn't have the opportunity to use ""real"" mozza and fresh basil, but it still turned out great.  I found I needed to add some balsamic vinegar, as another reviewer suggested - to give it a little more punch."
45007,8507,6/20/2002,4,"This is a great recipe.  Another variation on it is to subsitute Feta Cheese for the Mozz.  Layer tomato, basil leaf, and Feta on top.  Microwave one minute.  If you use thick sliced tomato it adds a great deal to the eating experience."
59064,8507,6/21/2003,5,"I love, love, love this combination of ingredients. Mozzarella cheese is often truly vegetarian ie contains no animal rennet, so this is a good recipe for vegetarians. Perfect summer food."
7802,8507,6/27/2003,5,"I had eaten this in restaurants before and loved it, so I decided to give it a try at home. I made exactly as the recipe describes except I stacked mine: tomato slice, basil, mozerella, olive oil drizzle. Very simple recipe...and very tasty. Thanks for posting it Tish."
26512,8507,5/25/2004,5,"This tastes just like summer! Absolutely delicious. I drizzled some balsamic vinegar on the finished product as well. I could eat this until I pop :)
I did have some leftover and I made Bruschetta with it this morning and melted under the broiler. I'll be making this often, thanks for sharing!"
18765,8507,6/10/2004,5,"I've made this type of salad many times and everyone devours it.  This is excellent to bring to a picnic - you can layer the tomatoes, cheese and basil on a large tray or dish then drizzle the dressing over after you get there.  I also like to add some very thinly sliced sweet white onions to the plate.  "
8688,8507,7/9/2004,5,"We have had this salad in restaurants before, so I already know we would love it and I certainly was not disappointed!  I served this on individual salad plates which worked out perfectly.  It's a beautiful salad and a delicious one to boot.  Great for a summer supper using garden tomatoes.  Thanks Tish!"
185105,8507,7/10/2005,5,"Sooo good!  Thank you for posting this, Tish!  I think I saw Giada make this on the Food Network...Really fresh and light.  I did use Rebecca1's suggestion and drizzed some Balsamic vinegar with the olive oil as well...YUM!"
175574,8507,7/11/2005,5,"Our Summer side dish staple once the tomatoes in the garden get ripe!

This is a perfect salad to showcase summer's freshest ingredients.  This is all about taking just a few REALLY GOOD ingredients and putting them together, nothing can be hidden or 'fudged' with this one.  Use your favorite extra virgin olive oil and if you can't get really ripe fresh tomatoes, dont' bother making it! Great recipe post Tish!  "
71324,8507,7/24/2005,5,"This is exactly the same as my recipe for this salad. One of my favourites and so easy to make at the last minute! This time I made it with cherry tomatoes grown on the vine, just cut in half, that's why the toms in the picture look so small. Thanks for posting!"
96177,8507,9/19/2006,5,"Yep.. this is a keeper. Just like the caprese I lived on while touring Italy years ago. Thanks for sharing. There's nothing better than fresh mozzarella and tomatoes, and fresh basil a top.
Maryanne"
133174,8507,10/17/2006,5,"Garden fresh tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and fresh garden basil makes a wonderful salad.  I sprinkled the salad lightly with Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Wonderful and so easy."
29196,8507,11/15/2006,5,Simple and delicious. We used bocconcini and freshly ground sea salt and black pepper for this.
363962,8507,12/20/2006,5,"one of my favorite combinations is tomatoes and fresh basil, and the rest of ingredients made this even better, this is my favorite salad now, thanks Tish."
373817,8507,1/25/2007,5,"We had this tonight with our pasta. I didn't have any balsamic vinegar, but I did have red wine vinegar--So that's what I used! It still tasted great! Yum!!!"
431813,8507,2/11/2007,5,"Perfect light summer salad.  I served it with Lemon Spaghetti (#125120), Chicken Breast Lombardy (#41009) and Foccacia for a casual dinner with friends.  Everyone left full and happy!"
158086,8507,3/4/2007,5,I made a big plate of this for our italian dinner on sunday...it was all gone....so it must have been a big winner...
171084,8507,6/10/2007,5,"Excellent recipe.  I first had this at Big Daddy's in Dallas, TX several years ago.  Since then, it's been a staple on our dinner table.  Thanks for posting this awesome recipe."
53932,8507,6/11/2007,5,If only I had home grown tomatoes for this!  I used fresh mozzarella and did add the balsamic vinegar.  Simply delicious.
207176,8507,7/11/2007,5,We love this with the balsamic too!
20480,8507,7/25/2007,5,Great recipe!only difference is I used lemon juice intead of balsamic vinegar and I slivered a handfull of basil and sprinkle it on. So glad I found this one again; simply fresh!!!
403028,8507,3/15/2008,5,I loved this recipe.  I lived in italy for three years and have been wanting to make a caprese salad.  This was so close to the real thing only thing that would have made it better was if i could have gotten some Mozzarella di Bufala
665035,8507,11/9/2008,5,Love this recipe and make it just like it is posted everytime I get the craving!
1052065,8507,3/12/2009,5,I had Italian night at my house and made this. It was a hit with everyone> I chilled mine for a few hours and did also add the balsamic vinegar. Nice fresh clean taste.
231054,8507,5/20/2009,5,I've been making this salad for several years.  It's especially wonderful when I can get my hands on some vine ripe tomatoes at the peak of the season.  I also like to use fresh Mozzarella -- and I never omit the balsamic vinegar.
248097,8507,6/6/2009,5,This is an excellent dish. I serve it as a salad sometimes. I have added chopped black olives and finely chopped anchovies also. Use less salt if adding anchovies.
440324,8507,6/14/2009,5,Simplicity at its best!
425154,8507,6/23/2009,5,"Yum!  What an easy, summery, flavorful salad!  Especially so, because I had home-grown tomatoes and basil!  I love the presentation, too.  I did add the balsamic vinegar...nice!"
511388,8507,8/12/2009,5,Yum! I made fresh Mozzarella today (30 Minute Mozzarella) and made this salad to go along with some stuffed pasta shells with white sauce. It was sooooo good. :)
447742,8507,8/30/2009,5,"Summer on a plate!!  We eat this often every summer.  I agree, fresh mozzarella is a must.  I never thought of drizziling with balsamic.  I'll have to try some that way next time."
1380151,8507,9/10/2009,5,"My favorite tomato dish! Used home grown basil, really set it off. Fantastic!"
844554,8507,10/15/2009,5,"Yum! Made as part of dinner last night. I stacked sliced tomato, chopped basil, mozzarella slices and drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and pepper. Very good! Thanks for posting."
485109,8507,1/20/2010,5,One of my favourite recipes! I didn't use balsamic vinegar- I prefer to let the other flavours shine through. Wonderful just as it is!
400708,8507,2/2/2010,5,"In Italy I think this is called a ""Caprice"" Salad. It's one of our favs and yes - fresh Mozzarella and Fresh Basil is a must. Best in the summer when all those vine ripened tomatoes are in season."
1651996,8507,11/17/2010,5,"I made this after watching Giada make it on Foodnetwork and it was so delicious,so easy, and doesnt leave you feeling hungry afterwards like most salads, its very filling. I usually add a little pepper flakes to give it a little spice. Very yummy i've eatin' it 3 days in a row for lunch."
1606864,8507,5/16/2011,5,Yes yes yes... I make my own Rasberry-Balsamic reduction (reduce Framboise and a nice Balsamic) and drizzle that over along with a good cold pressed Olive Oil (has a little peppery kick depending on the region). When I really want to make a bang I serve this with a few white anchovies on the side of the plate. YUM!
542060,8507,6/22/2011,5,"Always wondered what people saw (tasted) in a tomato, basil, mozerella salad, but made this because I had a basil plant growing wild. Mmmmm it was so delicious and the best part was that the kids loved it too."
177638,8507,8/7/2011,5,A delicious and easy way to use summer tomatoes.....pretty for company...
74904,8507,10/9/2011,5,"Absolutely perfect, just as written!  Pleasing to the eye.  Thank you, I will be serving this often."
394496,8507,5/21/2013,5,"Exactly what I was looking for. I liked it with balsamic vinegar drizzled, though I was a bit inept on the &quot;drizzling&quot; technique."
738401,8507,6/22/2013,5,"I&#039;ve made this very salad many, many times.  Just purchased some ciliegine (small fresh mozarella balls) and cherry tomatoes last night to make again today with my own fresh basil.  I do cut the basil into strips when I make this salad.  I enjoy it both with and without the balsamic vinegar - but if you have a really good aged one, it is superb! Fresh cracked pepper is a must in my opinion.  I agree with a couple of other reviewers that fresh or canned anchovies alongside the salad is a great addition once in a while!  Thanks for posting this simple and delicious recipe, Tish."
1800292167,8507,10/16/2014,5,This is such a refreshing treat!  I loved it! :D
1060667,8507,9/22/2016,5,"Please, please, please you only fresh mozzarella in this! The cheap waxy stuff will not be the same. This is a delicious appy and of course I chose to drizzle with the optional balsamic, who wouldn't? :)"
2001248861,8507,7/25/2017,5,Excellent but used buratta instead of mozzarella and used balsamic glaze with the olive oil. Great recipe!
2001862185,8507,5/29/2018,5,I have made this for years. Always a crowd pleaser. Kick it up a notch and use 'reduced' balsalmic and toasted walnuts. Yum!
2001853029,8507,6/4/2018,5,What is there not to like perfect in every way and perfect presentation and the taste is great thanks
2001728203,8507,7/3/2018,0,So good!
12076,19485,5/19/2002,5,"My husband loves spinach & served this up to his great delight! Really nice.
Lynn"
171551,19485,10/24/2006,5,Yum!!  This is so much better than boiling in water.  I sauteed the onions and garlic with the bacon.  Then added the rest.  This one's a keeper.  Thanks for submitting. 
440324,19485,11/30/2011,5,An excellent side dish. I used prosciutto in place of bacon. Thank you.
38049,29467,9/9/2002,0,"Delicious recipe, however the recipe did not state what to do with the oatmeal. I used it in the meatballs."
28177,129528,7/17/2008,4,"Very easy recipe & I loved that it grilled right along with the steaks.  No heating up the kitchen at all!  I wish I could rate it a 5 star but there was just something missing.  I will make these potatoes again in the future but I will add a lot more seasoning.  At the table we ended up sprinkling on some Johnny's Seasoning Salt & that made a huge difference.  They were just really bland without it.  This is probably just personal preference, as my family tends to like a lot of flavor.  I used both green & red pepper in the mix & next time will use fresh garlic instead of the powder.  Thanks for sharing, Lvs2Cook!  Made & reviewed for July 2008 BBQ/Grilling photo challenge."
369715,129528,9/9/2009,4,Hubby was making steaks on the grill so slide these on beside his steaks. I followed the recipe as written but have to agree with Tink that they lacked a bit in the flavor department. My kids just put some ketchup on them and enjoyed them that way! Made for Fall PAC 2009
313076,161887,4/23/2006,5,"Great for a cold, rainy day!  My kids loved it!"
56734,161887,8/20/2006,4,Made this on a weekend when it was raining out.  It was great! 
1012643,161887,2/20/2009,5,This soup was 100% wonderful. I made wheat egg noodles with my pasta maker. I will make this again and again!
133174,215412,10/19/2007,5,A delicious and hearty gumbo. Perfect for the cooler fall nights. I did find it necessary to add approximately 1 1/2 to 2 cups of water and it was still very thick. This was made the night before and reheated for dinner. I think this allowed the flavors to blend. DH and I ate half the recipe and the other half will go into the freezer for later. This was served with recipe #253678.
306797,215412,10/29/2007,5,"Wow, this was fantastic.  We had this for dinner tonight, simply accompanied by crackers (due to lack of time).  I substituted potato for sweet potato, as neither of us particularly like it.  I also left out the coriander for the same reason.  Due to time, I browned everything, then put in my pressure cooker for 10 minutes.  This worked perfectly for us, but will try cooking as per the instructions in the future.  I'm sure the leftovers we're having for lunch tomorrow will be spectacular.  This will be a regular in our house.  Thanks so much Jen for sharing this fabulous recipe."
439759,215412,11/30/2007,3,"3 stars means liked it!  I liked this recipe, but if I did it again, I'd substitute sweet for regular potatoes.  I used left-over pork chops instead of pork tenderloin for the meat and left out the okra/zucchini.  Ate with corn bread."
75919,296757,6/30/2008,5,"This dish was so rich and luxurious and delicious! My French friend went mushroom picking and gave me a big bowl of chanterelles and this was the perfect dish for them. I made it a little easier by skipping the sauteing of the mushrooms and pancetta ahead of time. I just sprinkled them on top of the chicken. I also did not drain the marinade from the chicken. I let everything cook in it to make a wonderful sauce. I picked the leftover chicken from the bone and used it with the leftover sauce, mushrooms and pancetta over pasta the next day for lunch. So good!"
223854,395825,10/28/2009,5,"Hubby's favourite cut of steak is Porterhouse, so I had to try this recipe.  I used Certified Australian Angus Beef and cooked it for 4 minutes each side (Hubby loves medium rare).  Served with steamed broccoli and Recipe #203668.  Hubby and Little Miss (DD) really enjoyed the steak.  I don't eat red meat so I can't comment on the flavour but the technique was really easy to use.  Thank you mightyro_cooking4u"
481092,395825,3/20/2010,5,Perfection!  This is the best way to grill steaks as it just enhances the natural flavor of the meat.  Grilled a total of 7 minutes on high flame of gas grill for a perfect charred rare steak.
67728,448630,5/4/2014,5,"Unusual and tasty! Eye-catching and pretty pink, too! When warm, they are very gooey and a tad greasy from all the butter, but they cool down into something more like a traditional blondie in texture with a slightly crisp outer crust.  I used 2TBS less butter than the recipe called for (didn&#039;t feel like cutting into a frozen stick of butter for the last 2TBS). Seeing how mine came out when warm, I&#039;m guessing that you could probably cut the butter amount down to 1 stick (1/2 cup) and still get good results in the end. The amount of white chocolate chips seem like overkill when mixing them in, but it&#039;s perfect once baked. I wasn&#039;t sure I was even going to get to try these, since Strawberry Nesquik is pretty scarce in my area for some reason -- I looked for it at 5 different grocery stores before locating it at the sixth! And yes, I DO turn into a persistent terrier when I&#039;m looking for special ingredients for something, lol. I&#039;m really glad that I got to try these, though. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
2001473707,448630,4/5/2017,5,"I made these with 2 tbsp less butter and added chopped walnuts in them... AMAZING! Everyone loved them. Fudgy consistency, very sweet flavor that is balanced enough to bring the strawberry and white chocolate out perfectly. They have a mellow pink color that's perfect for Valentine's day or a pink themed party of sorts. Highly recommended if you have Nequik lying around that you need to use up or want to try something new. Thanks!"
537937,477434,6/4/2012,5,"Awesome bars.  If you like raisins, you'll love these.  The crumb topping is also an added bonus with the chopped walnuts.  Made for PRMR."
39835,477434,2/2/2014,4,Very good bars which we enjoyed - they taste like the hermit bars we used to make. Comfort food for a winter day! Thanks for sharing!
2545728,521583,3/10/2016,5,"What a great recipe! I add some jalape&ntilde;os on top at the end, just to give it an extra kick ;) This was so easy to make! I will be adding this to my monthly recipes!"
276837,56516,12/24/2005,2,This was a little bit too sweet for me. I like my hot chocolate a little bit more of a deeper chocolate taste.
33159,56516,12/26/2006,4,This hot toddy hit the spot!  I found this to be the perfect amount of chocolatey but a little too sweet - I don't think the sugar has to be added when using the syrup.  Very nice before-bed treat!
60989,69272,10/17/2004,4,"This is great comfort food, warms you up and fills you up quickly on a cold day. I used 1/2 cup extra pasta (little shell pasta) because it was still a bit too soupy. Next time I might mix  bit of garlic into the meat for a touch more flavor. Thanks for sharing! "
56463,178702,7/25/2006,5,"This is a delicious, nice mix of flavors and textures. I roasted the green beans with olive oil, salt and pepper for 18 minutes in a 450 degree oven. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I only used half the dressing and it was plenty for us.
I found that letting it marinate at room temperature for about 30 minutes mellowed out the red onions. My husband and I both enjoyed it. This would be great at a potluck supper. A can of drained garbanzo beans would add fiber, but it is just great as is. Thanks, Carole in Orlando"
145352,178702,7/18/2007,5,"Delicious!!!! I made a little more dressing than I needed, but I'll just save it for tomorrow!! Beautiful too!"
41894,180403,8/3/2006,5,I have made this for a few years now. It is one of our  favorite recipes!  
328235,180403,8/10/2006,4,"This was really good and filling. Next time I make it, I might skip the Bean w/Bacon Soup as I don't much care for the flavor. 
Thanks for the post. "
278493,180403,4/18/2007,4,The filling is very good. Great to eat on a cold night.
199953,180403,4/1/2008,4,"Very filling and yummy. We got about 9 servings out of it. I made a few changes, using Smart Ground instead of beef, lowfat cheese, only half the can of soup (next time I'd leave it out -- didn't like the flavor), and only 3 T of cornstarch. It was really tasty, but the bottom pastry got a bit soggy. I think it would be good with just a top crust or -- even better -- a cornmeal top crust."
975775,180403,10/2/2008,5,I took the advice of some of you and omitted the soup because we don't care for the smokey taste of it and our dinner came out delicious. I also forgot to add the garlic but it was wonderful!
2001483818,180403,4/11/2017,5,I have been making this recipe for years. It is a family favorite! Even better the second day!
136997,192698,11/25/2006,5,"What can I say, but that this is simply delicious. It didn't say which italien sausage to use, s I chose the mild as my tounge can't handle very spicy things. Because of this, I also ommited the hot sauce/pepper. I also halved the recipe, since it's just 2 of us at home now. Another winner Carol! :)"
405761,192698,1/25/2007,5,"I used this recipe as an apertizer for Christmas lunch served over a simple salad of my favourite greens and dressing. It turned out to be a great hit! I did have to adjust the servings since there was only 3 of us. A great appertizer to ""make ahead"" and take to a dinner party!"
311566,192698,2/12/2007,5,"Well, Kitten...
I have actually made a many of your recipes and needless say this one is another great one. My BF requested these for his birthday dinner and they came out fantastic!!! I did halve these for the two of us. Thanks for the recipe!"
465872,192698,1/22/2009,5,"I had to use a great deal of substitutes (regular pork sausage vs. italian, bread crumbs+seasonings vs. croutons, italian blend cheese vs. mozzarella) and they still turned out perfect!  Love the recipe!"
418438,192698,2/22/2010,5,Really yummy!  Thanks for the recipe.
1803587929,192698,12/31/2014,5,Delicious! This recipe tastes exactly like the sausage-stuffed portabellas I buy from a local gourmet shop.  The recipe is really easy and the end result very satisfying.  Next time I am going to use baby portabella caps and make as an appetizer.
1802421864,192698,5/23/2018,5,"Wonderful dish, awesome recipe!"
592481,193648,7/2/2010,4,"This dressing is very strong, and you won't need much to spice up a salad.  Next time I might add more mustard and a bit less vinegar.  It turned out pretty good for a fat free dressing."
248640,196493,4/21/2007,5,"This recipe is great!  Very versatile!  I made it with just crawfish once, and just shrimp once.  The only thing I added was 1/2 sweet red pepper.  It ws very simple to make, and even with a whole stick of butter - it's not too bad calorie-wise.  WW pts - 6 when you break it down into 8 servings.  This recipe is added to my book!  Thanks Chef!"
740430,196493,3/13/2011,3,"I thought this was a fairly good start but bland as is.  I added about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, a few dashes of tobasco sauce, salt and black peppper.  I think after that it was a pretty good dish ~ about 4 stars."
157167,211223,6/22/2009,5,"Wonderful!  I made the Japanese curry powder, and it tastes almost just like the bottled stuff, which I can't find at the store anymore.  I couldn't find any fenugeek either, so I didn't add it.  I also used ground spices so I didn't toast them. Great recipe, I'm so glad I gave it a try.  I thought I'd add that I served some curry made with this to a Japanese friend.  He asked for the recipe, and has shared it with three Japanese friends.  It must be authentic :-)"
86318,211223,7/27/2011,5,"This review and rating are for the second listed, Japanese curry powder. I made it to use in Ellie's recipe #62534. I quartered the recipe since I don't like keeping spice mixes in my kitchen, and got almost 3 tablespoons curry powder. I did greatly increase chili pepper, which I think is a personal issue. I also think I will increase the turmeric slightly when I make it again. Thank you, Sandi, for posting this recipe."
427184,233853,9/2/2008,5,"I'm familiar with the Sonoma diet, and make many of the recipes in the book. For diet hummus this is great!"
213909,288651,4/9/2009,5,"Wow, this is Fantastic!! I served it over a salad of mixed greens,carrots, green onions and lightly salted peanuts and Chow Mein Noodles on the side.15 Ladies devoured almost the entire pint it made! :-)I would love to know what ""Wafu"" means/stands for? Regardless this is a KEEPER."
1802884114,288651,7/3/2014,5,"There was only one Japanese restaurant I tried this addictive dressing at and finally have found the recipe!  It&#039;s not the raw gingery type or the sesame gritty creamy type...it&#039;s more like a Japanese ranch, awesome!  You can tailor it to your liking by adding more soy or vinegar depending if you like tangy or salty."
1111119,288651,7/11/2018,5,I was very surprised at how much sesame oil the recipe calls for - sesame oil has a pretty strong flavor - but the flavor of the finished dressing is not overly sesame-ish. Good recipe.
743849,330313,1/19/2009,4,"This was very easy to throw together and it was tasty.  I would add more rice next time as there was a lot of sauce.  Overall, a good dish.  I made exactly as directed.  Made for Newest 'Zaar Tag Game, 1/19/09 - NELady."
89831,330313,3/13/2009,5,"very good, I baked this in the oven at 350 degrees for 40 minutes, also added in 1 teaspoon garlic powder, cayenne pepper and 1/4 cup milk, salt and black pepper, thanks for sharing weekendcooker!"
1375688,417624,10/2/2010,5,"Very Good!  I had to change a lot cause half way into it i realized i had no eggs, marjoram or spinach! lol.... BUT i used greek yogurt (lightens it up a TEENY BIT) and the rest of the ingredients.....  it is SO creamy and delish!!!!  definately will be making this again...and again!  Its easy too!"
400708,488093,10/10/2012,4,"This was such a fun recipe; took me back to when I was a kid and I'd beg my Mom for grilled hotdogs (of course I wanted hot dog buns, but the bread worked fine) was a little fancier (and better) with the cheese and lettuce.  I did use mustard instead of mayo - can't stand mayo.  And swiss cheese instead of cheddar as that's my favorite.  Made for Fall PAC 2012"
52176,15574,10/25/2002,5,"I made this for a visit from my brother and his grown son and they really enjoyed them.  I made one adaption. I used my food processor and chopped the celery and onions into the meat mixture. Then I added the rice by hand.  It was very easy preparation.  It is kind of like cabbage rolls without the cabbage.  I served with perogies and vegetables.  I really enjoyed the leftovers, too.  I will definitely make again."
746881,15574,1/30/2008,5,My husband and children LOVED this and so did I. I am my own worst critic and don't usually LOVE what I make but these were outstanding!! Thank you for the recipe I will be making this often. Very simple to make. I also finely chopped the celery and onion in my food processor then added it to the beef with the other ingredients and added about 1 tsp of Worcestershire Sauce to the tomato soup just because. YUMMY
57256,15574,12/30/2008,5,"These were very good ! I added my finley diced celery, and onion to the meat mix and used 1 cup brown Minute Rice instead of the par boiled white rice. This is a great ""warm up the house"" winter recipe !! Served with recipe#85629. A perfect pairing !!"
1246828,15574,10/3/2012,5,"Excellent recipe! Made it just as stated. My husband loved it. Used 93% lean beef, basmati rice and campbell's tomato soup. Couldn't have been easier. My thanks to the mother-in-law."
28862,17088,1/17/2002,4,"Great recipe.
I altered it a bit to suit my own needs.
I added 5 cloves of garlic chopped, fresh rosemary, and 1/2 cup of red wine instead of the water.  I also cooked it in a crockpot.
I cooked it slow for about 6 hours.
It's very hearty and I liked the idea of cutting the vegi's BIG, it adds to the heartiness!!!

15023,17088,1/29/2002,5,"Easy and delicious. I made this for my aunt who is on a low salt diet and it was a big hit. I substituted frozen peas for the green peppers, but didn't add them until 30 minutes before serving."
124504,76458,7/1/2005,4,Great recipe with or without the chocolate . Made one of each. Next time I'll try 1/2 peaches and 1/2 raspberry.
330937,76458,5/16/2007,5,I really liked this cake.  The butter gives the outside a nice crispy crust and the flavor is great.  I actually ended up making this in two circular pans and then frosting for a birthday cake.  It was a nice surprise to have the cobbler when most people expected a standard white or chocolate cake.
193014,76458,12/7/2008,5,"We love this!  I halved the recipe, and the one problem I've had consistently is that it burns around the edges before the center seems really cooked.  This has not prevented us from gobbling it up and wishing I had not halved the recipe."
537188,76458,6/27/2009,4,This is yummy - very moist and full of fruit!
74904,76458,12/26/2011,5,The Raspberry and Chocolate was just wonderful together!  Thank you for a great Recipe!
42337,96367,7/27/2004,5,"This is by far the best pumpkin bread I've made, being a huge pumpkin fan I've tried a lot.  I used freshly grated nutmeg, Penzey's china powdered ginger and I ended up with two loafs and it cooked for 60 minutes.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe when I saw it posted I couldn't wait till the fall.  Sorry I messed up on the typing of the first review "
140424,96367,5/20/2005,5,"Absolutely wonderful! A few months ago I tried a slice of pumpkin-ginger bread at my local bakery, and I haven't forgotten it since. I went online to find a recipe that was similar, and I'm happy to report that this one tastes just like it! Very moist and delicious. It got rave reviews at our potluck last night, and is now nearly gone. Yes, there are a lot of ingredients, but the directions are pretty basic. Just mix them all together, pour into pans, and bake. Very easy! Thanks for the recipe, Keolani!"
54271,96367,10/24/2005,5,This is a wonderful way to bring in fall. The smell while baking was heavenly. The taste is wonderful. The spices are just right. Will be making this for Clients during the holidays and for many years. Thank you for posting!
246749,96367,12/20/2005,5,"This is fabulous! Very easy to make, and delicious. My picky kids have been begging for me to make it again!"
10979,96367,12/21/2005,5,"Wonderful! I doubled the recipe and made 12 mini loaves last night. They smelled some good and tasted even better.
Thanks for the recipe!
Debbi"
116401,96367,12/26/2005,5,"Awesome bread!I was sooooo pleased with this bread..I'm not the best when it comes to baking this type of recipe, but it certainly didnt fail me!It made five and a half mini loaves for me, but I filled them pretty full. Cooked for 55 mins and that was just right.Excellent flavor and they looked beautiful to boot. Lots of happy people after they received these for gifts.Thanks so much-PeggyLynn"
145451,96367,12/27/2005,5,"Ok, I made this recipe twice and I doubled all of the spices except for the ginger and the second one was better than the first!! This was amazing frosted with a GOOD cream cheese frosting. Both loaves, both times I made it were gone in no time flat. I have many asking for the recipe. Thanks!!!"
246293,96367,1/30/2006,3,"We really enjoyed the recipe, but I was expecting a little something more, in regards to flavor. The recipe came out to a rather large loaf- perfect size!"
303164,96367,5/6/2006,4,This is great....it's the closest i've gotten to Starbucks pumpkin loaf yet!
248420,96367,10/16/2006,5,This was excellent.  I added some golden raisins instead of the nuts. 
274977,96367,11/8/2006,5,This is really great tasting bread.  I didn't have enough ground ginger on hand so I used some fresh instead.  Really big ginger flavor.
308889,96367,11/9/2006,5,"This is very delicious bread!  I didn't have 2 loaf pans to bake at once.  So, I made one loaf and 12 muffins.  It's very flavorful and fills the whole house with the smell of Fall!  Thanks for the great recipe."
398877,96367,12/10/2006,5,"Great Pumpkin loaf. I love the one that Starbucks sells in Fall and this is just as good as that. I love it and my whole family does too. I am baking two loafs right now and want to take one for a test drive to the office on Monday. Instead of nuts, I used pumpkin seeds and put a whole cup into the mixture. They taste great in the loaf. I hope the stores don't run out of canned pumpkin anytime soon. This bread is a regular must."
464842,96367,3/13/2007,5,"By far the best Pumpkin loaf I have ever had. When I first read the recipe I thought it seemed like alot of ginger, but it was FANTASTIC. I did double the cinnamon as we love cinnamon around here. I have made this at least 20 times since I found this recipe and we love it more every time. I have also used this recipe for muffins and it was equally great. Thanks!"
514561,96367,6/12/2007,5,"I loved this pumpkin loaf. My friends and family couldn't guess what gave it the unique flavour.  The ginger, thats my little secret!!!"
352005,96367,7/30/2007,5,"This recipe is AWESOME!!!!!! The only issue I had is that the recipe didn't say what size loaf pan to use.  I used two 9"" pans, and I had some batter left over.  Next time, I'll just put the extra batter into a smaller pan and bake it along side the bigger ones. Wonderful bread!!!"
334915,96367,11/22/2007,5,"I used a 10"" bundt pan instead of loaves.  If you choose to do this, add approx 12 minutes to cook time.  Then I sifted some powdered sugar over the top.  Brilliant!!"
529278,96367,12/11/2008,5,"YUM!  I got 1 regular loaf and 4 mini loaves out of the batter.  It was great as written, but I do think I'm going to try doubling all the spices except ginger (as someone else suggested), just because I love these spices so much."
1424744,96367,10/24/2009,5,Moist and delicious!  Will make again.  Loved the ginger taste.
302910,96367,12/6/2009,5,Awesome recipe. I increased the spices by a half for extra favor. Next time I will try it with a cream cheese icing
1273226,96367,2/16/2010,5,"If you wanted to eat the holidays in one dish, this would be what I choose!  You get the pumpkin for Halloween/Thanksgiving and the gingerbread for Christmas!  I love the way it smells while cooking, they should put that in a candle!! :)"
357071,96367,9/15/2011,0,This was excellent. All the right spicesIt makes 3 nice loafs I would give it more stars if I could. thanks
363055,96367,10/30/2011,5,Wow!  This is very good bread.  I used fresh pumpkin from my garden and will definitely do the same next time!  Thanks for the recipe!
853067,96367,11/25/2011,5,"This is delicious bread.  I made it just as written, except that I made 2/3 of the recipe.  It made enough to fill one loaf pan and two Pyrex custard cups.  I served it with a cream cheese/powdered sugar glaze, which was yummy, but it is also good plain.  Next time I plan on trying it with pecans and golden raisins."
116401,101768,10/16/2004,5,"Very good!Dense,Spicy&Yummy~I'm kind of on a quest for the perfect pumpkin bread~i'd say this is in the top three~bout 60 mins in a glass loaf pan was my cook time. I didn't change a thing other than that.PeggyLynn"
37305,101768,11/17/2004,4,"PICK YOUR CHEF November 2004: Like Peggy Lynn, I was on a quest for the perfect pumpkin bread!  This is a tasty bread, but not quite what I was expecting.  I like my pumpkin bread a little spicier and a little nuttier.  It also came out lighter than most breads, almost like a cake.  Followed the recipe to a ""T"", so I guess it's just a matter of taste!  Would definitely appeal to people who enjoy a lighter bread.  Thanks for posting."
203604,111182,3/17/2005,5,I thought this was great. My husband liked it too.  I do think that I would add more sausage than the recipe calls for.  I used Irish cheddar cheese in it.  
551883,111182,12/5/2008,5,"Very yummy frittata; it made a very nice lunch for me and my husband.  I added more sausage as the previous reviewer suggested, as well as doubling the mushrooms - we love mushrooms.  :)  I wasn't able to slice the sausage raw; was I supposed to cook it before starting the recipe?  I ended up just removing the casing and crumbling it while it cooked with the mushrooms and onions.  Still very good."
1331190,111182,7/22/2009,5,Fast. Easy. Tasty. A winner for me. I halved the recipe for two and still had a small piece left over.
283390,187213,10/22/2006,5,"This is so fresh-tasting and light! I also appreciate that this fairly exotic-tasting dish uses stuff you can easily get at a regular grocery store. I didn't add the cayenne, by the way, and then wished I had after I was done preparing it (nothing that a little sriracha can't fix, though). Thanks for sharing!"
936577,187213,7/12/2009,5,"This is our new favorite stir-fry recipe!  The sauce is amazing and it uses items I always have available! I did marinate and fry the tofu first, as I do with all stir-fries, it gives the tofu a much better flavor and texture in the dish. Thank you so much for posting this great recipe! We will definitely be making it again :)"
60716,187213,8/31/2011,5,"Delicious!! The sauce is truly fantastic and I had all of the ingredients in the house already to make this other than the mushrooms. Outside of that, I made this recipe as written adding in a full 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne. Wonderful recipe Sharon, thank you for sharing!"
196067,187213,12/11/2012,5,"Just the right sweetness. I halved the tofu though, using just one block of firm tofu. That was the right amount, but I made the full recipe other than that. I used enoki mushrooms, red instead of green bell pepper, and I added diagonally cut bok choy when I added the tofu cubes. It was delicious. My husband said it needed more green (we didn't use the green pepper) so my leftovers which are amazing! have some fresh de-stemmed and de-veined, roughly chopped kale that had been tossed with some olive oil and sea salt earlier today. OMG! I had a hard time stopping the fork before storing it away for tomorrow's lunch."
457625,187213,3/17/2014,1,"UGH! you couldn&#039;t pay me to make this again.  So cloyingly sweet.  It tastes like cheap Chinese except you stood for 35 minutes matchsticking carrots, celery, and pepper.  I followed instructions exactly, with one exception: I used a red bell pepper instead of a green bell pepper.  I&#039;m so upset I wasted so many vegetables but I simply cannot stand the taste of this, even having drained away much of the sauce. If you do decide to make this I&#039;d cut down on the sugar and vinegar."
283251,212183,10/1/2007,3,"These were easy to make, and I thought they were good. DH found them a little bland. Like they needed something more. More cheese maybe?"
291306,188598,1/1/2007,1,"Ok--surely this recipe has a typo.  I tried it but just couldn't add 5 tablespoons of garlic powder.  I added 3 tablespoons, and that was too much!  We love garlic, so that isn't the problem--it was just too much of a good thing."
322548,190320,10/16/2006,5,"wonderful, simply wonderful! I used rice vinegar and subbed the soy for braggs as we can't get hold of it here. It was very flavourful without being overly spicy. I used it to dip veggie nuggets in, my only complaint - not enough of it! "
1107439,193779,1/1/2009,5,"I made this with chicken breasts which I chose to flatten before coating. It worked great, I loved it, nice and crispy!! Will try it on chops next time!"
50969,193779,2/11/2009,5,"UPDATE: I made this again on 2/10/09,and this time it turned out much better than the first time I made this.So,that's why the rating went from 4 to 5 stars.I did do a couple of things different,first I used a couple of butterflied pork chops and cooked it at a lower heat.And since mashed potatoes were served, I took a bit of the drippings and made some gravy.I've got to tell you, the drippings make some very good gravy. ""YUMMERS :)"".
I have to say I'm glad to be the first one to rate and review this recipe. This was made on 5/5/08 for mine and SO's dinner and boneless pork chops were used.If you use boneless chops, I would suggest cutting the cornmeal mix and breadcrumbs down to 1/4 cup each.And as they were frying, I did sprinkle a little seasoning salt on each chop.This was a very moist and tender chop.And had a very good flavor,this will be made again. Thanks for posting and, ""Keep Smiling :)"""
269521,216749,9/23/2009,5,"YUMMY! Made a perfect light supper last night. I did embelish it a bit . . . added fresh sliced fennel and minced garlic and left out the dill. First sauted the leaks and fennel in the butter; then added the raw cubed potatoes and broth, which made for a one pot meal. Simmered for about 20 minutes, then pureed a portion using my immersible blender stick. Used cream instead of half and half therefore did not need the flour. Thanks for sharing!"
169430,216749,12/17/2009,5,Thick and delicious soup that certainly sticks to your ribs. I lightened it some by skipping the butter and sauteing. I just cooked the potato and leek in the chicken stock until the leek was tender and the volume had cooked down. That went into the food processor and when it was smooth I added fat free coffee creamer for the half and half along with fat free sour cream. No flour was needed and I omitted the dill from personal choice.
2908494,216749,7/18/2016,5,Absolutely delicious! My husband and I are in love! I served it with a sprinkle of bacon bits in the bottom of the bowl.
445845,225082,5/4/2007,5,"I made this for my husband and we both LOVED it! I used chicken tenders instead of breasts and cream of chicken soup, used two cloves of garlic, and added cheddar cheese to the crackers and butter mixture. It was sooo delicious!! Definately something I'll be making alot!"
47907,225082,7/13/2007,4,I made this for dinner last night and we really enjoyed it.  I made half of the recipe and next time I will add a little more garlic just to spice it up a bit.  This would be a great dish for a potluck.  Thanks for posting!
371126,225082,9/16/2009,5,"Quite good! Made half the chicken mix, but full crust. I added a palmful of parmesan to the crackers, also used a tsp garlic powder and a 1/2 tsp seasoned salt instead of the tsp garlic salt."
104295,249847,8/31/2007,5,"Trying to clean out what I have before the movers come plus keep the kids fed for breakfast (since we are out of cereal!) has meant lots of quick breads lately.  This one is excellent.  I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand.  I halved the recipe and used just one egg.  Used 3/4 sugar 1/4 splenda.  My applesauce and bananas were a tad low but I upped the carrots a little bit.  Had no vanilla so left it out.  And I am embarassed to say I used white flour.  (I'm usually a whole wheat girl but my local stores don't carry white wheat or whole wheat pastry flour and I needed some right away.)  This was a really tasty, very moist, bread.  We all enjoyed it.  I look forward to trying it again when I can make a full recipe and freeze some!"
171790,212183,10/2/2007,5,These are so easy and delicious. I only had the small packages of puff pastry and the recipe worked just fine. Thankyou for posting.
463298,249847,9/22/2007,5,"I just made this tonight and it's wonderful! It tasted like a cross between banana bread and carrot cake. I made 1 loaf and 3 dozen mini-muffins. I substituted 1/2 c applesauce for 1/2 of the oil, and it seemed to work out pretty well. I only had all-purpose white flour on hand, so that's what I used. I also cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups. I had a problem with my loaf sticking to the bottom, but I think that was probably because I didn't let it cool enough before I tried to take it out of the pan. Overall, it is an excellent recipe and I will definately be making more."
592373,249847,11/5/2007,5,"TOTALLY DELICIOUS!!!!! I made 2 loaves & we ate one as soon as it cooled. I love it  because it's healthy & so moist. I'll definitely be keeping this recipe & making these often. Only change I made was that I doubled the cinnamon, because we were out of allspice... still awesome!! Thanks"
360369,249847,11/13/2007,5,"Yummmm! I made only two minor changes, added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon (actually cinnamon plus from pampered chef) and used half olive and half canola oil. I think I might try this with pumpkin instead of banana just to see how it tastes. My hubby says don't mess with it it's perfect. We loves this bread! Thanks."
705251,249847,1/16/2008,5,Okay - according to my 11 yo DS - this bread is a masterpiece!  We all had to have a piece as soon as it was cool enough to cut.  I had to use canola oil instead of olive oil (as I had run out) but it all worked very well.  Added a bit more cinnamon and allspice as we like those spices but it would have been fine without the extra too.  Nice and moist.  Absolutely delicious!
336058,249847,1/11/2009,5,"I made these into muffins.  I was concerned that it looked like too much liquid for 3 cups of flour, esp. since I use freshly ground w.w. pastry flour.  I added an extra 1/2 cup, had under a cup of banana, used Sucanat, 1 tsp cinnamon, added 1/2 tsp almond extract.  Whole wheat muffins don't tend to rise much so I usu. fill them full.  They made 24, baked for 25 minutes.  However, they were so moist that they kind of spread, rather than rose.  The last muffin I didn't have enough for and that was the best looking one!  So I would fill less than full and make more next time.  I was thinking about trying honey instead of sugar, but I would have to reduce the other liquid quite a bit, as honey makes it moister.  My family loved them.  Next time I will add a little more flour, protein powder and some flax seeds."
839492,249847,6/25/2013,4,"I wanted to use up some ripe fruit. The recipe is very versatile, you can use 3 cups of basically any moist pureed fruit or vegetable. I used 2 pears, 3 bananas and applesauce to equal 3 cups. These make beautiful muffins or bread. I made 1 loaf; 12 regular and 20 mini muffins from this recipe. The finished product was moist and flavorful.  I also reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and still found it to be quite sweet. Thanks for sharing, I will use this again to &quot;sneak&quot; in some veggies to my son who has an aversion to most veggies. They freeze beautifully, just pop them in the microwave and they taste like they&#039;re fresh out of the oven!"
253974,258451,2/22/2008,5,"I don't seem to be able to rate this. I've tried 4 times now. This is a wonderful dressing. I first had it on a beautiful tuna salad for 2. Then I used it as a marinade for shrimp, then chicken.It doubles and triples great! Great taste! I wouldn't change a thing! Thanks Linda for sharing!"
83093,258451,2/25/2008,5,"A wonderful dressing without a lot of fat â€“ my kind of recipe! Before I juiced the orange, I grated the zest and added it to the dressing for an even more intense flavor. I served it over a salad of mixed baby greens, orange segments, scallions and a sprinkling of fresh herbs. Just great!  Thanks for posting!"
197023,258451,3/2/2009,5,"Enjoyed this immensely with salad greens and, pretty much as Linda suggested, with mandarin segments and kalamata olives.  Yummy and so refreshing.  We love citrus-based dishes, sauces and dressings.  I also added some fresh basil and parsley, and look forward to trying this with other fresh herbs when I have them on hand.  This is a dressing which will make salad greens served with pretty well any meat, pasta, noodles or rice dishes so much more flavoursome.  Thanks for this yummy recipe, Linda.  It's one I'll certainly be making again. Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders."
2734801,497251,3/13/2013,5,So easy to make and really good- great with just a salad
1641166,258451,6/26/2010,0,"This was a very good dressing. The only comments I have: I used white balsamic instead of regular to preserve the orange color of the dressing. I also used white pepper instead of regular black. I, like a previous reviewer, also added some orange zest for some added kickI served over a salad of greens, garlic scapes, mandarin orange segments and honey sesame sticks from Trader Joe's.  At the last minute, I added a tad of the light syrup to the dressing from the mandarin orange can. It came out very good!"
2894864,258451,7/8/2013,5,"I followed the recipe exactly and it was a PERFECT compliment to my salad!  I was suffering through a hot and humid New England day and was craving a crisp, cold, fruity salad for dinner. First I made the salad add ins: a mixture of blueberries, strawberries, peaches, apples, fresh raw corn and celery all tossed with salt.  I then tossed my romaine and baby spinach in the dressing, added a few spoonfuls of my mixture, and finished it off with feta cheese and a dash more dressing!  I marinated chicken in Lawry&#039;s Baslamic marinade and grilled it up!  Some people put the chicken in their salad, some had it on the side.  This dressing really was a knock out- and it was so simple I will be able to remember it forever! :)"
201581,297324,4/23/2009,5,"I followed the directions, using pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg. I wasn't sure what to expect from a recipe called pudding, but described as cake. It ended up like neither, but more like spicy bread pudding with topping sauce. I scooped some warm into a bowl, added some ice cream and spooned the sauce over all. YUM! This would be excellent after Thanksgiving dinner, and using gingerbread spices for Christmas dessert. Thanks for posting Raelene. Made and enjoyed for PAC Spring '09."
369715,335747,12/27/2008,0,"I'm not giving this any stars as I don't think we like brats. We had never eaten brats before. The store had them on sale so I thought I would give them a try. I made this exactly as written using Budweiser for the beer. No one liked these but again, I think we just don't like brats. I make sausage with onions and beer and we love that. I'm sure if you like brats, this is a wonderful recipe."
544438,335747,12/30/2008,5,"These were really good!  I made them mostly as directed, except I finished them on a pan instead of a grill.  I put them on wheat buns and added mustard.  My boyfriend and I were very happy with the recipe.  Thanks!"
1196284,335747,6/24/2012,4,"This was good, I used 2 cloves of crushed, fresh garlic instead of powder.  I also used my George Foreman because I don't have an outdoor grill.  I like that I can have beer brats AND cheddar brats at the same time.  And that I can flavor it the way I like instead of how the company that makes the beer brats likes."
996399,346062,1/10/2009,5,"Very spicy and very good!  My hubby loves buffalo flavored ANYTHING, so this was a big hit. Thanks for posting- I'm always looking for good, quick dips, and this certianly fit the bill."
424680,384106,9/11/2009,5,"Made this bread using part of another recipe of yours, recipe #384672 #384672, & both were a big success & most satisfying! And, although they are a great combo (& I look forward to combining them again & again), I do plan on making this sourdough bread as given here! Thanks for sharing some great recipes! [Tagged, made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in the current Pick A Chef]"
439759,384106,10/28/2009,4,"Really yummy, but got kind of chewy after a day or so.  Great way to get your fiber!  Also makes good toast :)"
780172,399967,2/10/2010,4,"This was an interesting twist on breakfast. It had decent flavor, but did need something to give it a zing. Next time I might try some other herbs."
758101,406171,12/31/2009,4,"This recipe was listed in the margin of the page and it turned out that I had all of the ingredients, even smoked gouda leftover from cheese and crackers, ham leftover from Christmas dinner, and bacon, so I thought it was serendipitous to have found this recipe. It was a little more complicated than most of the things I cook, but WOW it was good. My cheese sauce broke apart (I think I had it on the stove too long or the heat was too high), but the flavor was amazing. I sauted the ham a bit before adding it, but the flavor of this recipe is so good you don't even need it. I am going to try this again without ham and using turkey bacon instead. My kids thought it was too cheesy (they prefer their potatoes very plain), but I loved it. Excellent recipe."
55461,11967,9/30/2002,5,"This is possibly the best pot roast I have ever eaten.  It was moist and flavorful.  Best yet, it cooks on the stove.  I did use a meat thermometer and stopped cooking at 160."
790231,406171,2/6/2010,5,"Yummy comfort food. I halved the recipe and made it in an 8X8 pyrex casserole dish.  Smoked gouda is VERY hard to shred by hand even when very cold.  I ended up cutting it into very small cubes instead, it doesn't like to melt as well as cheddar either.  I used skin on red potatoes and they were perfect.  I served with a side of peas.  I recommend letting this sit for 5-10 minutes after removing from the oven so it firms up a bit.  Thanks for another winner Sarasota!!"
1275177,406171,4/7/2010,5,"This was the best scalloped potatoes we've ever had!  I grew up eating scalloped potatoes consisting of potatoes, onions, milk ... not so great!  Yours were delicious!  I didn't have half-'n-half but used evaporated milk with great results.  Thank you, Sarasota, for a most delicious recipe!"
269521,406171,5/10/2011,5,"Amazing flavor!  Did not have any gouda so substituted a good quality swiss.   I too removed the dish from the oven and let it set a bit.   Don't think I made the sauce thick enough, so will just have to try again ;=) lol!   Thanks Kim for a great 10 star recipe!"
28087,406171,12/31/2011,5,Absolute decadently delicious casserole. The flavor of the smoked Gouda cheese and creaminess of the white Cheddar put this version of Scalloped Potatoes & Ham over the top. A true keeper and will be made again. Thanks for posting this flavorful recipe.
560491,406171,2/26/2012,5,"GREAT scalloped potatoes!!  I did peel my spuds because they didn't look so good on the outside, and also left out the celery since DH doesn't like it.  I loved the gouda and white cheddar together and I like my sauce thick too so I didn't thin it out with any additional milk.  Will definitely make this again!  Made for Best of 2011 Cookbook Tag."
468351,406171,4/18/2012,5,"Fabulous scalloped potatoes!  I had some smoke ham left over from Easter, and this recipe was the perfect way to use up the left overs.  Will be making this again!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
1802964648,424551,7/25/2014,4,When making this recipe be aware of the scoville heat units of your cayenne.  A half teaspoon of cayenne 40 is going to be less spicy than a cayenne 90.
461834,484456,7/6/2014,5,"Wonderful pie!!!  I made this exactly as written and it was a hit at our 4th of July weekend BBQ with my DS and his girlfriend!!  This is a very rich, chocolate pie.  I would suggest you cut 1/2 of your normal slice of pie.  Brings back childhood memories of smores when I was off at camp.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!"
1333172,484456,9/2/2014,5,"Fun and delicious! This was a success at a Labor Day cookout with friends. Great way to wrap up the summer. I made the crust and filling as directed, but then just spread marshmallow cream on top and torched it with my creme brulee torch. That seemed to work rather well, though the topping did ooze a little once the pie was cut into - I don&#039;t know if the mini marshmallows would do that. Thank you!"
319738,484456,5/31/2015,4,"This got good reviews and was a good alternative to actual smores (it was raining).  I cooled the pie completely before adding the marshmallows and wonder if serving the pie with the chocolate custard still warm would make it even better?  (Or maybe waiting until the marshmallows cooled more so there wasn&#039;t so much of a temperature difference between the custard and the topping?)  Regardless, thank you so much for a fun and yummy dessert!"
300855,7390,4/30/2006,5,"I love this recipe!  Excellent spice mix!  Next time though, I'm going to do a lot of prep work before I start cooking."
358304,7390,6/3/2007,5,Great recipe! It took a bit of preparation but well worth it! I served it for friends and the verdict was unanimous - delicious!
591035,7390,10/6/2007,3,This didn't have the right flavor for me. I also found it odd that the rice and vegetables aren't mixed before baking. Not the biryani I was looking for.
936998,7390,8/28/2008,5,"This was so good! I made a couple of changes since I wanted to use what I had on hand. I used ginger paste instead of fresh ginger, used some frozen carrots and peas , and didn't use the cauliflower, bell pepper, or raisins since I didn't have them on me. I sprinkled some toasted almonds on the top."
1246600,7390,5/28/2009,5,Our house LOVES this!!  Although we find it a bit mild for our tastes so chuck in some fresh chilli and some garam masala to give it a bit more taste.
1041521,7390,7/25/2009,4,"This was a very good recipe.  It tasted a bit different from the biryani I have had in the past, and I could not put my finger on the reason.  Perhaps it's just a regional difference."
1333781,7390,1/16/2011,2,"I omitted the cauliflower and peas; otherwise followed the instructions to a T. The flavour was in the vegetables, while the rice was bland and slightly overcooked. As a simple rice and vegetables dish, it was fine. As birynani, not really. I won't make this again."
56112,93720,11/12/2004,5,"I saw this in a recipe promotion thread, and when I clicked on it, I realized that I have made this before.  So here I am doing a review.  I love these.  They are wonderful with the brown sugar on them, but if you are watching your sugar intake, they are just as good without the sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe."
37449,93720,11/25/2004,5,I cooked these alongside the turkey for Thanksgiving and it was delicious! I cooked ate 325*F. for about an hour. Thanks KC! I'm so glad I picked this for Ingredient Tag!
52543,93720,12/4/2004,5,"Delish! I substituted with red Spanish onions as Vidalia's are outrageously expensive in Canada at this time of year. They were perfect alongside steaks, baked potatoes & mixed veggies in a foil pack - grilled out in the cold by my hubby. Thanx Kristen!"
52448,93720,8/11/2005,5,"This was an unusual dish for me to make..we loved it. Since it was my first go and do not know how salty the chicken cubes would be in this recipe, and the onions were not very large,  I only used 4.
I served this with roast chicken, potatoes and broccoli."
228742,93720,6/3/2006,5,"Good recipe, I didn't have boulion cubes so I used a teaspoon of granules instead.  If you have big onions, double ingredients - mine were HUGE and could have used a bit more flavor.  We'll have them again, thanks for the recipe!"
54697,93720,6/29/2006,5," My, oh my.... I'd forgotten how nice these are.  My ex father-in-law made these years ago."
740120,93720,5/12/2008,5,"Fantastic!  This is now my new favorite food to grill.  I omitted the brown sugar, and substituted a little garlic, just because I don't like sweet foods.  I grilled with marinated pork chops.  Next time, I will try this when I grill steak and corn-on-the-cob.  Thanks for the great recipe."
256795,93720,5/19/2008,5,"This is fabulous!  It took longer than it says~~maybe my onions were bigger.  I only did three, but it took about 40-45 minutes to cook.  I made it again on the stove by simply cutting the onions into big chunks and sauteeing them in a pan with the other ingredients.  It was ready in just a few minutes and was just as tasty as in the oven.  Thanks so much for sharing!!  My hubby loved them!  :O)"
64583,93720,5/22/2008,5,"Very nice recipe.  I scaled the ingredients down a bit and used 1/2 tsp. bouillon granules, 1/2 tsp. olive oil and 1 tsp. brown sugar for each onion.  Mine took longer than 30 minutes also, but I just finished them up in the microwave.  I served these with turkey burgers and Recipe #14031.   Thanks for posting."
749562,93720,7/5/2008,5,"These were excellent!  I followed your grilling directions and made them on the 4th of July.  They were so tasty that I ate a whole one right out of the tin foil.  Typically, I just add a bit on a hamburger but many of my guests were also just eating them whole.  Very sweet and flavorful.  I also was serving corn-on-the-cob and one of my guests poured the juice left in the foil over his ear of corn and said it added great flavor to sweet corn.  Thank you sooo much KC_Cooker for sharing this recipe.  When I grill this will be the way I will prepare vidalia's in the future."
171084,93720,5/28/2012,5,What a super easy side dish to make!  My onions were smaller so I halved the ingredients.  We did the foil packets on the grill as a side to KC Strip Steaks.  Wonderful!  We will make these again!  Thanks for sharing!
1365025,93720,7/5/2013,4,These tasted pretty good. The sauce was too good to waste so I drank that but next time I will thicken it a little so it sticks to the onion. It took about 45 min. to bake so I think I will cut the onions into chunks and bake it that way.&lt;br/&gt; Made for Zaar Cookbook  Tag.
162398,99563,9/11/2004,5,"Thought we should try this chefs other recipe as the first was so good, and yet again she hasnt failed to impress. This is a great compilation of tastes and textures and if we could rate a 10 star we would!Well done - looking forward to some more from you cathi!"
162409,99563,9/13/2004,5,I agree!
222478,99563,6/18/2006,5,"Amazingly scrumptious! I used normal size capsicums so used two of them with the same amount of stuffing and found it far from too much, although I was using it as a major component of the meal. Rather than cook under a grill I cooked in an oven for 30 minutes at 180'C (350'F)."
394617,114139,12/11/2006,5,"We love it!!!  I had planned a birthday dinner for my mother-in-law and thought this recipe looked great to make.  It was a big hit with everyone, including the kids.  It had a lot of flavor and was easy to make.  This is a keeper for sure.  Thanks for sharing."
53932,114139,12/26/2006,4,"This is very good and very easy to make.  I used milk, but I think cream would have been a better addition.  Thanks for sharing."
385999,114139,2/15/2007,4,"I really enjoyed this, I love chicken and mushrooms."
343028,114139,10/24/2007,5,"I had this dish at my goddaughter's house for a birthday dinner. It was restaurant quality! Very, Very good. Simple ingredients resulted in a fabulous entree."
895132,181879,3/28/2010,3,"This is quite good if you use whole psyllium seeds, not husks. I wasn't sure whether the recipe meant husks or seeds, so I tried both. With one tablespoon husks I got a terrible glue the texture of which I did not like at all. Then I tried a second batch with psyllium seeds which was okay. I liked the idea of adding psyllium for some extra fibre, but next time I think I'll prefer the addition of some ground flax seeds.
For the milk powder I used powdered almond milk and for the protein I used whey protein. Also I added some dried cranberries.

363888,190594,10/15/2006,5,I've been looking for a healthy tuna casserole for awhile now...yours looks scumptious...thanks for sharing it.
187281,190594,10/20/2006,4,"A nice dish that was easy to put together.  I didn't change anything and have to say a few spices would have added something to this dish.  But my husband said he adored it and plans on having it for lunch tomorrow.  So, we give four stars."
549669,190594,7/31/2007,2,"I was looking for ways to use up the many many green beans that I have been finding in my CSA box and thought this recipe would accomplish that quickly if I doubled it.  So I did.  It turned out ok.  I used green bell peppers which kind of took over the dish.  I also used 14oz cans of Amy's Mushroom soup and the mixture was very liquidy before I baked it, but turned out to be a fine consistency when it came out of the oven.  I used whole wheat noodles and undercooked them by 3 minutes, but they still turned out mushy."
83093,190594,11/8/2007,5,"I loved this simple comfort dish!  Using whole wheat noodles and subbing sugar snap peas for the green beans, it went together quickly and filled up my dieter's plate without any guilt. I used 1 can of tuna for half the recipe and it served 2 perfectly. It baked up fast - 10 minutes and the topping was brown. Thanks for sharing this winner!"
593159,190594,11/30/2007,5,"Great!  I might use canned green beans next time though.  We liked this alot!  I left out the peppers, and used cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom soup."
323186,193487,11/6/2006,5,"Thank you for an excellent recipe, Muffin, I made this yesterday exactly as directed,  and it took my husband back to his childhood and his fathers cabbage bredie!!       Im always tempted to throw in extra bits and pieces  but in this case  I wanted to be true to the recipe and Im glad I did,  it needs no 'improvments'!    A new favourite!  "

47559,282824,4/2/2009,4,"I made this recipe for Pick A Chef, Spring 2009.  It's a very tasty casserole that the family enjoyed very much.  It didn't take long to put together before popping it in the oven.  We loved the spicy, beefy flavor, and the cabbage didn't completely disintegrate - there was still some nice texture to it.  The only thing I will do different next time is to add another 8 oz of tomato sauce to make it more moist/saucy."
50969,282824,6/7/2009,4,"This was made on 6/06/09 for the "" Hot, Spicy, and Tasty "" event. Since it was just myself and SO, the recipe was cut in half.Since SO doesn't like peppers ,and I don't like hot sauce those were left out.For the white, black and cayenne peppers, 1/4 teaspoom each was used. But next time I think I'll only use  about 1/8 each. I do agree with PanNan about the tomato sauce, the full 8 ounce can of tomato sauce will be used for a more "" saucy "" dish. It was a very good, "" Hot, Spicy, and Tasty "" dish ;) . Thanks for posting and, "" Keep Smiling :) """
148186,290650,9/13/2008,5,I had this at Olive Garden and the first thing I did when I came home was look  up the recipe. Can't wait to impress someone else. The risotto they served went perfect with it.
1018543,290650,12/21/2008,4,"Delicious!  I'm now unfortunately relagated to making it every 2-3 weeks for my hubby!  Not that I mind, it's just a dish that you need to start well in advanced but it is worth it!"
300492,290650,6/15/2009,5,"OMG!!! This recipe was excellent! I always have this dish at Bucca de Beppo. One day I tried it at Olive Garden and I thought it was better than Bucca. I made this recipe and my family loved it! Tastes just like Olive Garden. Usually I make alterations on recipes, but this one I went strictly by the recipe! Excellent!"
67728,290650,10/31/2011,5,"Fork-tender beef in a thick savory sauce, so good! It definitely needs to be started at lunchtime to make sure it's done in time for dinner, but it's so worth it. Much of the time is pretty hands-off anyhow. I forgot to pick up crushed tomatoes when grocery shopping, so I used fire-roasted diced tomatoes and mashed them up a bit in the pan. I also used oregano in place of the rosemary (rosemary tastes like Christmas tree to me, not a fan). Poor DH was chomping at the bit to try this as soon as he smelled the meat browning, lol! Thanks for posting!"
2485456,290650,11/6/2012,4,Very good although I was not able to find the same beef short ribs as Olive garden.  I found it was a bit too much onion for us but that's just a matter of taste.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes because we were having friends with their kids over for dinner - very nice pairing.  I would definitely serve it again!
431813,290683,8/30/2008,3,"I used lots of fresh oregano and added some sea salt after cooking, and these still came out lacking in flavour.  We found ourselves wanting some fresh garlic or something a bit more intense while eating them.  Sorry Sara!"
756031,290683,9/3/2008,4,I love mushrooms and what a better way to enjoy them then to sautÃ© them.  I added 2 cloves of minced  garlic and a 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  I served these mushroom beauties with steak (Sara's Italian steak sauce recipe #312216).  [made for AUS/NZ recipe swap Sept. 2008].
361931,290683,10/16/2008,4,Good and simple.  Did add garlic as another reviewer suggested (we love garlic).  Thanks for sharing!
37449,363545,4/2/2009,4,"These were different and interesting and good! I used regular eggplant and white miso. I put them in the broiler and walked off for a moment and they burned a little, but still good. Thanks! Made for PRMR."
746803,367262,12/18/2010,5,I think I'm converted! Not really a fan of packet cake mix but this was very moist and tasty - I think the madeira wine helped.  Went a head and made another 2 cakes for the freezer.  Thanks for posting loof. Made for December Aus/NZ Recipe swap.
206747,367262,7/5/2012,5,"*Made for Australia/NZ Swap #66*  Really did go together in a jiffy, and baked for 50 minutes.  A lovely ""light"" tea cake.  Had no Madeira -- a Portuguese dessert wine, but had plenty of sweet Marsala, a Sicilian dessert wine -- where we visited the vineyard and winery last year !  Only had a small container of poppy seeds, maybe 1/4 cup or less, but was plenty for consistency and flavor.  Will keep this recipe handy for the future !  Thanks for posting, loof."
2001147313,402245,8/29/2016,5,These are some of the most delectable cookies I have ever tasted! Give this recipe a try!
169430,420714,4/19/2010,4,"I really love the low fat and sugar content in these and they taste very good (DH thinks that they taste like ""bread"" because for him they have ""no sweetness at all""). I think that the baking time might be a bit longer, mine baked for 8-9 mins and still had a doughyness to them. I got 19 cookies so the recipe is on the mark for yield as I made 3 bigger than the others. This is going into my Diabetic Pleasures cookbook :D."
107135,427322,7/24/2013,5,"wow oh wow omg these are good,make these my picture does not do the taste justice zwt9"
67728,427322,9/5/2013,5,"Delicious! I particularly liked the cinnamon almond crunch layer in the base -- it&#039;s a wonderful complement to the fruit filling. I had a couple of white nectarines to use up, plus a partial jar of sliced peaches, so I mixed them. They do get a bit soggy the next day if you drizzle them with the extra syrup ahead of time, but they&#039;re still very tasty. Thanks for posting! Made for The Hot Pink Panthers for ZWT9 Family Picks"
2001630278,427322,7/17/2017,5,I won a recipe contest with this recipe!! 15 entries and I won first! The only thing I added was a cream cheese bourbon drizzle instead of the powdered sugar!! The taste is amazing and everyone that's had some said they've never tasted anything like it before! Kudos to Cadillacgirl!
169430,499748,5/16/2013,5,This certainly isn&#039;t shy on the lemon and I love it! I used a good part of it to dress a potato salad in place of mayo that worked great. Would you believe that it&#039;s a wonderful fresh tasting salad dressing as well? lol. I used it also on a salad of simple mixed greens and they were elevated to something special. I used Meyer lemons by the way to make this simple and yummy dressing/vinaigrette.
2597942,499748,6/30/2013,5,"Just wanted to let you know that I just prepared your Lemon Dressing for tonight&#039;s dinner (I tagged it on PRMR). Anyway... I&#039;m going to use it as a marinade for our boneless skinless chicken breasts tonight. I was gonna toss them in the baggie with the dressing for a few hours, but the lemon is so strong, I&#039;m afraid it will start cooking the chicken in the fridge! LOL. I&#039;m only gonna marinate for 30 minutes before grilling them. That should be plenty.It tastes good so far... I will let you know how they turn out. UPDATE: This was perfect for a marinade for our chicken. I marinated them for approx 25-30 minutes. (I did not have fresh basil, so I used 2 teaspoons of dried from the shaker bottle and it worked well). Wonderful concoction, my dear! I will definately use this again! Thank you for posting your recipe."
53932,11967,2/11/2006,5,I roasted this at 325 for 2 hours (I had a smaller roast) and it was perfection.  Loved the seasonings and the roast was so tender and full of flavor.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.
19724,503,11/26/2001,4,"I am Malaysian and I have an awesome satay recipe that takes over 12 hours to make (much chopping, blending and overnight marinating required). This one took me about 30 minutes and used ingredients found in almost any American kitchen. For the sauce I used chunky peanut butter (I didn't want a smooth peanut paste), a pinch of cayenne pepper instead of chili sauce and added a tbsp of maple syrup (the Malaysian satay peanut sauce is sweet and spicy). Bottomline: Authentic-tasting? Not really. Easy? YES."
43152,503,6/20/2002,3,This title is a bit misleading for those who know true SE Asia cooking.  The recipe is interesting though and I recommend it.  I would lighten up on the soy sauce in the peanut sauce-it over powers it.  Overall a good meal worth repeating.
187103,503,2/9/2005,3,"Hmmm... that was interesting!  I really liked the marinade for the meat, but 2 whole large onions?!? I think that's gotta be a mistake.  I put in one, and there was hardly enough moisture left to accommodate another, let alone the one!  The sauce is good, but a little thick and overpowering.  I was thinking a little chicken broth or something might thin it out and make it more of a sauce than peanut butter with some coconut flavor and spices. I served this as a main dish over rice noodles, and over-all, I think it is worth making again.  I'd definitly like to try the meat skewers on the BBQ.  I bet that would be REALLY good!"
134737,38535,7/5/2005,5,"Family loved it.  When I went to make it, however, I discovered I had strawberries instead of rasberries.  Also, since it was the 4th we put in blueberries to be festive.  "
52282,57275,11/3/2003,5,"this was delicious and my kids loved it. i made my own polenta and poured half of it into the 13x9 pan to set. otherwise i followed your directions, but i did substitute basil for the cilantro, we enjoyed this"
69161,57275,3/12/2006,5,"I made this using recipe # 3503, microwave polenta. I chilled 1/2 the polenta directly in the pie plate & 1/2 in another pan...same as Chia did. Worked really well. This recipe makes so much, I froze 1/2 for a busy night & it worked out really well. Just put 1/2 the meat/bean/spices mix in a freezer bag. After thawing, the beans were a bit more mushy but otherwise tasted great!"
101823,57275,6/13/2007,4,This was a filling and easy weeknight dinner.  I halved the recipe and had more than enough for my hubby and myself.
981057,57275,12/5/2008,5,"This was a surprisingly tasty dish! When I looked at the ingredients it didn't seem as though the end result would be anything special. I did make a few changes--so minor that I don't think it would matter. I used ground pork instead of turkey, only used 2 TB of cumin and added 1/4 tsp of ground Jalapeno powder and I left out the green pepper. I topped it with the tomato called for but also added green onions. It came out with lots of flavor and I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing."
832019,57275,2/4/2009,5,"I agree with levicah, it is a surprisingly tasty dish. My family loved it!"
577394,57275,1/1/2010,5,"WOW! WOW! I halved this recipe and cooked it in a 9"" round casserole dish and made it Vegetarian... AWESOME! I changed a few things- Instead of green pepper, I chopped 2 Jalepenos, Regular oil instead of Olive, No Turkey, No diced tomatoes, just 1 thing of Medium salsa instead, and there was no need for cayenne pepper since I subbed the salsa and jalepenos for heat. Also, I didnt do the fresh tomatoes on top, and I used a Cheddar/Jack Mexican mix cheese and my Boyfriend and Mom LOVED it! I will definately make again! Thanks so much."
729254,57275,1/11/2010,5,"This was excellent! Very flavorful, easy,unique, and uses one of my favorite ingredients, polenta. I will add this to my regular rotation."
1167599,57275,3/3/2010,5,"This was absolutely wonderful~!!  I followed this recipe to a ""T"" except I subsituted the meat with Morningstar meal starter because I am a vegetarian.  This had so much flavor, my daughter even liked it and she is super picky.  I have tons left over and will eat it for lunch and dinner until it's gone!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!"
725883,57275,6/10/2010,5,"I also substituted veggie crumbles from Morningstar for the turkey. We only had enough polenta for the top, it was still delicious! Thank you!"
2287360,57275,6/7/2012,4,"My family likes all these ingredients so I tried it.  But it's WAY too much polenta for our tastes and I didn't even use both tubes. Next time I would make thin 1/4"" slices for the bottom layer, leave the polenta off the top and I would double the amount of meat from 1 pound to 2.  I used ground chicken instead of turkey.  Lots of leftovers from our family of 4"
1526450,149664,11/5/2011,5,This recipe is super easy and I had everything needed on hand :) I didn't add any onions as my family is not big on them - but it still turned out great!
485109,57275,3/11/2014,5,"This was a lovely, healthy meal and we really enjoyed it. I only put cheese on the top rather than between each layer and used low fat cooking spray rather than oil. We&#039;ll definitely make this again! Thanks for posting!"
1802912072,57275,7/11/2014,0,A dish the kids will eat always deserves five stars!
2002303474,57275,10/16/2018,5,This is totally addicting! The only changes I made were using jalepeno pepper instead of sweet green and Mexican style diced tomatoes! Two of us literally ate over half a pan!
101823,141614,11/11/2005,5,"I had leftover roasted acorn squash on hand that I wanted to use for this recipe.  Therefore, I diced the onions and carrots, sautéed in a bit of olive oil and then simmered in some stock until tender.  The resulting soup was excellent.  The seasonings were perfect for a fall comfort soup."
315565,141614,7/11/2009,4,Great way to use left over pumpkin and a great way to warm up on a winter's night. I also added a dash of orange juice with great result.
84386,141614,12/1/2009,5,"Perfect! I was served this very soup at a gourmet club dinner, and everyone loved it. I finally got the recipe, and it's identical to yours! I've made it for Thanksgiving for 2 yrs now, and people loved it! I like that it's a creamy soup without any milk or cream. (other than the little bit of cream fraiche garnish- DO ADD it! Takes it to another level!) One final note, is that I think it takes more than 15 min. prep. Because there's the work to be done after the squash is roasted too. No adjustments need to be made. It's wonderful!  Thanks for posting the recipe here Gillian. I'll be watching for more of your recipes! :)"
231198,154443,9/20/2007,5,"This is a definite 10-star recipe.  It's incredibly easy to throw together, and tastes deliciously tropical!  My only substitution was to use Del Monte Jarred mangos from the produce section.  And the topping......Oh, the topping.......TDF!!!  Thank you, so much, for posting this wonderful recipe.  I will definitely make this one time and time again!"
2000398830,154443,8/12/2015,5,"Amazing, easy recipe.  I did add extra mango puree in the topping and cake mix.  So yummy.  I will definitely bake this again."
365545,172271,10/18/2006,5,Wonderful!  Just like the Domino cookies at the cookie store in the mall.
176615,172271,9/29/2007,5,"These cookies are absolutely fantastic! Rich chocolate cookies chock full of chips. Cookies remained bendable but crisp on the outside even when cool. It's not a typo, no egg is used in these cookies. Delicious! Wouldn't change a thing! Thanks for sharing the recipe! Made for PAC Fall 2007."
110239,172271,1/9/2008,5,"Very quick to make, tasty, chewy!"
833135,172271,6/15/2008,5,"I made these cookies for an ad presentation. Our presentation went very well, and the awesomeness of these cookies sealed the deal. And now, everyone is always bothering me to makes these cookies for the office!"
1085213,172271,12/19/2008,5,This is the real deal.  If i could have i may have given it a 4.5 . . . I prefer a little less salt.  From now on I think i am going to use a dash of salt.  BUT absolutely delicious!!!  Tastes great with peppermint chips too!
223854,212183,8/8/2007,4,"These were so easy to make, we used them with a dip. You could really play around with this recipe, add different spices or even some seeds like sesame or poppy seeds.  I just took them out of the oven almost an hour ago and they are almost finished.  Thank you Mommy Diva"
351811,212183,12/16/2007,5,These were perfect served with soup! I added fresh parmesan and grated parmesan cheese to mine. Came out very tasty. Also cooked at 350' for about 10 minutes. They came out more soft bread sticks instead of crunchy. My personal preference. Thanks for sharing an easy to remember recipe. I will make these again. They are so versitle. Excellent idea! ~V
226066,218353,4/1/2007,5,So simple yet so delicious!  Made these for lunch today and it was wonderful!  Made on my indoor grill.  Only change I made was to use some prosciutto that I had to use up (that I cooked in the microwave until crisp).  Thanks twissis - will make it again for sure!!  :)
394085,218353,8/29/2007,5,"Really wonderful 4... 4 and a half ...three bites later...it's a five.  The ONLY reason I initially thought 4 was because of my preconception that a grilled cheese sandwich should taste at least slightly cheddarish.  I'll have to get over that. :-)

I used my panini grill/press and LOVE the crispy 9-grain bread.  Instead of crumbling the bacon, I laid 5 thin-sliced half-slices of bacon on the cheese/tomato mixture.

I just love this sandwich!"
166642,218353,4/27/2008,5,"This is an outstanding sandwich. I love the flavors of the cream and blue cheeses, the addition of the bacon and the fresh tomato slices. I really adore this sandwich. Thanks for sharing!"
780172,218353,12/19/2008,5,"I made this recipe, exactly according to directions. I loved the addition of the tomatoes and bacon. I do not like blue cheese, I find it overpowering, but DH loves it. Next time for my sandwich I will 1/2 the blue cheese and I will like it as much as DH did this time!"
85309,218353,5/3/2009,5,"Really, really gooooooood! Thanks for the keeper Twissis."
305531,218353,6/27/2010,5,Yummy! Made this as directed and loved it. Thanks for yet another keeper Twissis. Made by an Unruly Under the Influence for ZWT6.
386585,218353,7/5/2010,5,"Wow - this was outstanding (and I don't even like any type of blue cheese!).  I made this exactly as posted, using gorgonzola and rye bread.  Absolutely delightful.  I would only caution that you let the sandwich rest for a minute or so before slicing, so the filling doesn't run out when you do so.  Thanks for sharing this treat!"
89549,218353,9/23/2013,5,"Very good. I just sliced my tomato and laid it on, rather than chopping and stirring it into the cheese. For my taste, I might cut back a little on the blue cheese, or use milder variety of blue."
865936,218353,8/25/2014,5,Love the creamy texture alongside all that flavor!  Really good!
67728,218353,9/19/2014,5,"I don&#039;t think I would&#039;ve thought to put these ingredients together in a grilled cheese sandwich, but I&#039;m really glad that someone else did, lol! I never would&#039;ve thought to use Italian dressing as the &quot;butter&quot; on the outside of the sandwich, either -- learn something new every day! I used smoked blue cheese and light cream cheese in this (leftover stuff I needed to use up). I chopped my tomato and just sprinkled it on top of the cheese right before cooking. I was wrapping it to grill at work for dinner, and was afraid that the tomatoes would make the bread mushy if I mixed them into the cheese ahead of time. Thanks for posting, twissis -- this definitely cheered me up! Made for Culinary Quest I Family Picks"
679953,218353,11/16/2014,5,"Very good... I left out the tomato for myself, but everyone else had them.  The cream cheese/bleu cheese mixture was awesome, and with the bacon on top, it hit the spot."
1226481,277134,8/13/2010,3,"I didn't mind this but no one else in my family liked the pairing of fruit and meat.  I didn't need any extra chicken stock though, because cooking the chicken strips resulted in broth and the pan never needed de-glazing."
1382026,386604,9/12/2009,5,Very tasty! Always better the next day too.
2000552348,459648,10/12/2015,5,I&#039;ve tried several recipes with baby cereal and this one is th best so far. It actually looks and tastes like pancakes. I used vanilla soy milk for the liquid. My little one loved it! I freeze them and I can give home pancakes every day!
2001323847,459648,12/27/2016,4,I used baby oatmeal so I had to add about another forth of a cup or so of milk. My Lil ate it
2001400992,459648,2/21/2017,4,"My little one loves these! Instead of putting fruit inside, I'm using it as a &quot;dip&quot; so we can change flavors from day to day. Thanks for the recipe!"
2727323,497251,3/11/2013,5,These are a fantastic treat! Kids loved them
36803,22866,4/1/2002,5,"I served this for Easter and everyone raved--said they'd never had such a delicious ham.  The kids loved it.  The chutney was very good and the glaze was exceptional.  I made the chutney and spread it in the bottom of the roasting pan, then added a deboned ham topped with the glaze.  Thanks, Dorothy!"
5672,22866,4/13/2004,5,"I just fixed this for Easter Dinner and our son who really didn't like Ham loved this.
It was a refreshing change from the everyday ham with pineapples.
It's a keeper recipe!
The glaze was great but I couldn't find all the ingredients needed so I had to fudge it a bit."
12657,27809,5/14/2002,4,"Very nice, but I needed to add 1/4 cup water (I scaled down to 1 serving) because the mixture seemed to be drying out during the simmer. I didn't peel the eggplant, and also added a pinch of salt, and omitted the garlic. I'll definitely make this again when I need a quick veggie side."
42366,27809,8/2/2002,4,I paid attention to the first review and doubled the tomatoes to help with the liquid problem.  I also added a can of mushrooms and let it simmer away.  Very tasty.  I had leftovers so tonight I'm going to parboil some okra and add that to the pot!!  Very good.  Thanks for posting.
19799,27809,8/25/2002,4,"This had good flavor,but for some reason the eggplant was tough and rubbery.I think the problem was more in the produce than the recipe.I am going to try again using a fresher smaller eggplant."
62672,27809,1/7/2003,5,"I didn't have a problem with the eggplant drying out- I added extra tomatoes, maybe that's the key- I really liked this dish- I served it with spagetti!"
6512,27809,1/25/2004,5,"I love eggplant AND easy recipes and this one was great. I added a half of can of water and covered the skillet for the first 10 minutes of simmering, then removed the lid for the last 10 minutes and the eggplant was tender and moist. This is a keeper!!!!"
144102,27809,6/9/2004,5,"I have been looking for this - a healthier version of what my grandma used to prepare.  I love this and have made it 5-6 times since I found the recipe a couple weeks ago.  I like it best with double the tomatoes, double the seasonings, and a little salt, oregano and sugar.  Top it off with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.  Yummy and healthy!"
6258,27809,8/18/2004,5,"We loved this eggplant recipe.  It was delicious and moist.  Not soupy moist but moist enough to have a nice texture.  I was torn between using chili powder or chile powder (pure).  I went with the chili powder because it has oregano in it.  I did add an extra 1/2tsp. Mexican oregano which was very, very good.  Definately a wonderful recipe to add to my t&t collection.  You did it again, Tebo,.....thanks!"
35526,27809,8/11/2005,5,"Very nice.  Easy to make, quick and one of my favorite things, eggplant.  I added a touch af cayenne too for a little bite and boy was it good."
252536,27809,7/30/2006,5,I used 1/2 salsa & 1/2 diced tomatoes and it was very delicious. I will definitely use this again!
290499,27809,8/27/2006,4,"Super easy, supar tasty, and look at those nutritionals!  I used fresh tomatoes and so added some water, and after five minutes it was quite well done.  But it's fine with me!  I don't know why that is, but fifteen would've obliterated it.  I think this mix would be good with pasta, or added to tomato sauce.  I'm definitely going to be buying more eggplant."
326540,27809,8/31/2006,4,This was really tasty and my husband who is a bit picky about aubergine (eggplant) really liked it too.  We didn't peel the aubergine either and we did serve it with pasta too which went really well.  It was about 15 minutes until it was nicely cooked - lovely thanks!
173495,27809,9/16/2006,4,"Tebo, this is a winner! I used 4 small Japanese eggplant and added some sliced button mushrooms. Otherwise followed recipe and we loved it.I will serve the left overs (only 2 of us) tomorrow over some steamed rice.Yummy stuff. Thanks for a real keeper."
69161,27809,3/21/2007,5,"Had this the other night...the kids really liked it (ages 4.5 and 3 years). Served with white rice, another of the kids' favorites. Even my husband, who does NOT care for eggplant at all, ate it without complaints...he DID supplement the flavors with added sour cream and salsa!"
469903,27809,9/5/2007,4,"We really enjoyed this simple dish as a meal.  I served it with rice and it fed my family of three with no trouble.  In fact, I had leftovers the next day for lunch and they were still yummy!  Super quick and easy too!"
609693,27809,6/24/2008,4,"Really tasty! I used it as a main dish with some garlic bread. I imagine it would be great over rice or pasta. As other reviewers suggested I added a little salt, sugar, and oregano and about 1/4 C salsa. Super quick and easy."
169430,27809,6/25/2008,5,I have now made this numerous times and I just wanted to add that I have changed the can of tomato's to an equal amount salsa and I use 1/2 a tsp of chili powder. This is really good stuff! I'm making it right now to go along with broiled sole. *Another update*: it's now 2 yrs later and I'm still loving this recipe. I have just added a photo of it for tonights dinner. Yummmm!
391505,27809,9/5/2008,5,I wasn't sure what to expect from this recipe since traditionally I'd only used eggplant for italian recipes. But I was pleasantly suprised!  I did add some fresh chopped cilantro and served it on top of some whole wheat couscous. Served as a great side to Cilantro Chicken (#181195) to round out a healthy and tasty mexican meal! Will definately make this one again. THANKS!!
611113,27809,11/9/2008,5,"This was great.  We added black beans at the end and heated them through.  We put the mixture in a tortilla  and added cheese, sour cream and salsa for a wonderful tasting burrito.

Will definitely make this again."
107583,193454,12/25/2006,5,Very nice sauce.  Went well with the leg of lamb for Christmas dinner!  Thanks for posting this!
54199,39792,9/12/2002,0,"Cindy Lynn, whatta fluke I clicked on your name! I chose it b'cause thats my sis-inlaws name and Lo' and behold .............you had a recipe my grandmother used to make in WVA! The burnt sugar cake! I remember it well! I will definately give it a try soon........maybe for my sisters birthday! It will be a sweet memory for her, I'm sure......is the broiled frosting you mentioned  the same as  Seafoam frosting? A cooked frosting with a marshmallowy texture?That's what  Gram used on hers........When I make it I will let you know how it turned out! Thanx for the memories that were brought to mind just seeing that recipe!"
18391,39792,12/10/2003,5,"This is a great recipe! I made it in 2 9"" pans, baked for 30 minutes .. We loved this!! thanks"
427184,39792,5/11/2008,5,"Everyone loved it! I made frosting the usual way, but added the leftover burnt sugar Syrup and it was delicious!"
49361,42648,11/5/2002,5,"I'm always looking for new recipes for bundt cakes and this is a keeper! Makes a very dense and flavorful cake. The glaze is very tasty. I used canned pumpkin, butter and 2% milk."
107583,42648,3/6/2006,5,"Very good.  I love pumpkin cakes, breads, muffins, etc.  This is very moist.  I didn't have any rum, so I used rum extract and a little water for the glaze.  I made it another time with a maple flavored glaze."
278218,42648,10/10/2007,4,GREAT taste and easy to put together.  I would suggest at LEAST doubling the glaze - mine hardly even covered half the top of the cake and I followed the directions exactly.  It has wonderful flavor so I'm going to make more to add to the cake we already cut into!
231054,42648,9/18/2008,3,"This was tasty -- but has a very, very dense texture -- very heavy.  I noticed the batter was very stiff when I put it in the pan.  Plus the glaze wasn't enough for the cake -- so I'm going to make a second batch.  For those who prefer a dense, heavy cake, this would be ideal.  We tend to prefer something a bit lighter.  Thank you, Dee for sharing your recipe."
57479,53122,3/15/2003,5,"I made this for the weekend for a large crowd to eat with Yogi's Tasty Buns along with several other spreads.  I love eggplant so I really loved this.  I have made something similar in the past, but never with the dijon mustard.  This really gave it a nice taste and it is on my diet.  The only change I made was i used fried onion instead of fresh.  My husband does not always love the flavor of fresh onion in a salad and i didn't want to leave it out so I just chopped and fried it first and then added it.  It was great."
52448,61143,8/28/2003,5,Made this as part of a Mezze meal. The soft mixture is a bit difficult at first but I got better at handling it. Nicely spiced!
677398,61143,12/22/2009,5,"I served this as a vegetarian main course and it went over rather well.  I had no sultana raisins, but regular California raisins worked just fine.  I ended up with quite a bit more than 12 fritters and like another reviewer I had some trouble handling the mixture.  It's not the greatest eggplant recipe that I've come across, but it is a nice alternative to the more common uses.  It definitely hit the spot when I was in the mood for some Middle Eastern fare, and it tastes fantastic with tzatziki."
930100,61143,1/13/2010,5,"we found these fritters to be very tasty; it's my husband's new favorite way to eat eggplant.  Since we don't have a microwave, we roasted the eggplant at 500*F  for 10 minutes.  Initially the mixture was tough to handle, but once it came down to room temperature it was easy to handle."
527607,61143,6/13/2010,5,"I love fritters of any sort, these were wonderful. so full of great flavors, enjoyed them thoroughly"
142386,86693,1/1/2009,5,Yum. Taste a little like hummus.  I really liked this.  Served with wheat crakers and pita bread.  It was great.  Thaks for posting.
58104,98922,8/29/2005,5,I always loved fresh summer tomatoes and basil with mozzerella (I used smoked)But when you add sundried tomato dressing you have tomato Heaven. I did use my own home made dressing.
209747,98922,9/6/2005,5,really fresh and yummy! Used sweet red onion. Great low cal side!
49304,106241,1/17/2005,5,"Very good,I made 2 large onions made them just like the recipe stated. We really enjoyed them with Swordfish and a big salad. We love the syrupie balsamic sauce over the onion. Thank you Mermaidmagic, for the recipe."
37449,106241,2/18/2005,5,"I halved the recipe because it was just for me, but I wish I had made the full recipe, this was so good! I loved the intense taste of the reduced balsamic vienegar! Thanks mermaid!  :)"
52543,106241,3/5/2005,5,"If you love balsamic vinegar, this is a must try! Its also quick & easy. Thanx mermaidmagic!"
138376,107573,4/1/2005,5,"This recipe is from Southern Living, I've been making it for years.  Makes an awesome gilled cheese."
168921,149664,1/11/2006,4,"My DH and I loved this. I forgot to serve this over lettuce, and I added mushrooms. He just asked me to use less tomatoes next time."
469856,149664,3/23/2007,5,Love this recipe. Had it in a cookbook but misplaced the cookbook. Thanks for sharing.
1355934,193454,9/9/2012,5,"Excellent! Had over pan-seared pork chops (thin cut) and couscous. Easy and elegant. Next time I will add a bit more port, as I love the tart flavor."
131021,275423,8/2/2008,5,This was great. I think next time I will make it in a smaller pan as it was a bit spread out. I didn't use water chestnuts because I am not fond of them. I think this would also be a great make ahead dish.
724631,275423,9/15/2008,4,"4 Stars, until the directions are corrected to say what to do with the water chestnuts.  Used Margie99's idea, a 9x11 glass casserole was the perfect size.  I doubled the mushrooms, and they were welcome.  Used diced water chestnuts from my pantry, which added another shape to the texture.  Velveeta supplied its guaranteed melting and mild cheesy comfort to the sauce.  This recipe could be halved if Recipe #126969 #126969 was used for the cream of mushroom soup. This met my calorie justification criteria; these calories were worth it!  We plan to reheat the leftovers atop leftover skinless rotisserie chicken breasts, and serve with rice.  We ate this solo, but that didn't stop us from licking every last drop.  Thanks for posting. Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders."
1020526,275423,9/26/2010,5,"Yum!  I found this recipe in The Lady & Sons Savannah Country Cookbook.  It's a keeper--fast and delicious.  As far as what to do with the water chestnuts, you combine them with the broccoli, saute mixture of celery/mushroom/onion, and water chestnuts.  Thank you for posting!"
222564,275423,8/13/2014,5,"Nice and cheesy! Cant&#039;t get Velveeta here, but I used Dolcelatte, a creamy blue cheese, for a different tone. Goes well with all other flavors in the dish."
222564,275966,11/15/2012,5,So luxurious and yet so simple!
1008402,275966,2/26/2014,5,Easy and tasty. Once my husband picked up a bag of garlic pistachios by mistake and I didn&#039;t notice what they were until the fudge was done...we ate the fudge anyway. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For us Amuricans:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12 oz. semisweet chocolate&lt;br/&gt;1 14-oz. can sweetened condensed milk&lt;br/&gt;Pinch salt&lt;br/&gt;1 c. shelled pistachios&lt;br/&gt;2 tbsp butter.
91392,324948,12/10/2008,5,"It is a surprise, given tofu--hmmm... but this made really good lasagna.  The cheese-tofu layer would fool anyone.  It has a nice consistency not at all like silken tofu.

I fed this to my husband and he had no idea he was eating tofu, both of us are looking forward to seeing if the leftovers are even better than the first time out, and I will not hesitate to use this filling technique witrh my stuffed shells, cannelloni, etc.  

Very impressive, very nice, give it a try, just don't admit it has tofu in it until people have half finished it and they will be converts!"
498271,324948,12/14/2010,5,"I was totally amazed by this dish!  I've never had tofu before (not knowingly anyway!) but I'm always looking for ways to make my favorite dishes lighter and healthier so I decided to give this a try.  I don't care for onions so left them out, and I used turkey sausage instead of ground beef, otherwise made as directed.  Following your suggestion to generously season the tofu mixture I used about a teaspoon of basil, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon or oregano, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper.  The texture and flavor just as it should be, rich-tasting and creamy.  We really loved this and I will definitely make it again - thanks for sharing this keeper!"
39835,324948,2/1/2011,5,Great lasagna! I made it in one pan 13x8 and cooked it for 50 minutes. I also only had 6 lasagna noodles but it worked out great. Thanks for sharing!
424680,324948,9/4/2011,5,"Made this pretty much as given in the recipe & we were both totally satisfied with the results ~ Taste, texture, everything was A-OK & more so! Definitely a recipe to make again & to share with company! Thanks so much for sharing it! [Tagged & made in Please Review My Recipe]"
653438,324948,4/12/2013,5,I loved this and so did DH (even before he knew it had tofu in it and after).  I have never cooked with silken tofu but this worked out great!  Followed the recipe and definately will make this again.  Thank you for posting.  Made for Spring PAC 2013 and served a salad along with it.
1072593,327032,4/25/2011,5,I'm on my post Easter diet.  I was thinking about starting with a few guilty indulgences and then working my way back.
2001674170,93886,8/16/2017,0,Can you put in pint jars and let seal
428060,327032,7/19/2011,4,"This was pretty good. The first time it cooked over and made a giant mess. The second time I looked up some tips. You can use any regular cookie dough recipe to make cookie cake, but this one tasted great even when I messed up cooking it. For a cookie cake you preferably have a pan with sides, or put tin foil or a cookie sheet under it to catch messes. I thought about making a tin foil ridge underneath but forgot to try it. Make a slight indentation in the middle, like making a burger, so it is easier to cook through in the middle. Leave an inch or two of space around the outside of the dough to allow for spreading. Check it early and often. My cousin recommended trying smaller ones in pie pans."
2000430194,327032,2/16/2017,0,I haven't made this recipe yet but will be later today. I bought a bake it better pizza/cake pan from wart for 10$. Its big and round with ridges!!! I never follow recipes exactly. I always like to change it up and make it my own!! So...their will be alterations made to it. Will let you know how it turns out. cant wait to try it!!!
2657055,377531,1/25/2013,4,"These are very good considering I used sugar substitute (which is a little drying on the finished product).

332843,404335,1/19/2010,5,My MIL (Indian) makes this and it is to die for--and much simpler than a lot of other Indian cooking.  :)  This is one of my favorite side dishes.
363055,497101,3/11/2013,5,"I liked this.  I was worried about the peanut butter, but I thought it tasted just right.  I used shrimp instead of chicken."
131126,497101,4/13/2013,5,"I enjoy the ease of  stir frys.  They make such a quick dinner.  This one didn&#039;t disappoint in speed or flavor.  I used red and green peppers, preshredded carrots, and threw in a drained can of bamboo shoots.  I added a half teaspoon of sesame oil to the sauce. The sauce is sweet and I liked the nutty flavor.   Made for Spring 2013 Pick A Chef."
202432,8719,10/11/2005,5,"I only had Masoor dal on hand, so that is what I went with.  It was a hit with my eight year old daughter (my toughest critic).  We like coconut, so I used one cup of the milk.  I spiced it to our tastes and served it along side sweet onion rice with peas.  My daughter is already begging me to make it again, and we just finished supper.  Thank you for posting this treat!"
281055,8719,1/18/2006,1,"I Tried it, but was nothing like a gujarati dal. I think It should not have Coconut and lots of Corriander-cumin powder, as suggested by one of my gujarati friend."
107135,296082,10/22/2011,5,"wow this is good , i cooked them skillet top and they rock"
15572,21713,6/3/2002,4,"Wonderful stuff!  I added sliced green onions and lightly toasted slivered almonds to the sauce in the last stage of simmering.  Next time, I think I'll add some capers too."
49561,21713,8/21/2004,3,I could only give this 3 stars because it was plain.  I think if the sauce could be reduced with some seasoned flour it might help with the flavor.  I will try to make it again and add some different things.  Thanks for posting.
21752,22673,4/5/2002,3,"Great concept, but you have to know your audience.  My BH and I adored these pancakes, but the kids didn't like them.  The little barbarians just didn't appreciate the orangy deliciousness of these pancakes."
104295,22673,7/27/2004,3,"These have wonderful flavor, but really odd texture.  More like a crepe then a pancake, and too chewy for my taste.  Also, nowhere in the directions does it say when to add the boiled mixture.  I added it directly to the egg and juice mixture.  I used 2 egg whites in the place of each egg, and light soy milk for the milk.  Neat to try, though.  Thanks! "
9869,25096,4/20/2002,5,"This will be a regular in our house, lots of 'mmmmm's' to be heard. Doesn't say in directions when to add chicken, I did at the end of step 1, also added a shake of chilli flakes. 
This is a keeper!"
6258,25096,4/29/2002,5,"This was a great dish.  I made it for lunch and we absolutely loved it.  I followed your directions, but I added 2 Tbsp. of chopped green chiles.  I was not dissapointed with the outcome.
DH loved it and gave it his ""keeper"" review.
It was easy to prepare and the taste was good.
Thanks for posting. It will be in my T&T book for sure."
47341,25096,11/22/2003,5,"incredibly creamy and yummy!  i did the chicken the night before (picked the meat off a roasted chicken and put it in the fridge all ready for this recipe) which really speeded the prep up when i assembled these.  because i had 3 cups of chicken, i added in the entire 8 oz of cream cheese and some extra red bell peppers and got 15 enchiladas - enough for a few lucky sons' lunches the next day."
68960,25096,2/28/2004,5,"Excellent, very easy to put together and very tasty.  I baked in a 180C (350F) oven until cheese was melted on top and like Evie suggested added the chicken at the end of step one.  Hubby claimed it was a 'keeper'."
170909,25096,4/12/2005,5,"Excellent recipe for children - very mild, yet flavorful and delightfully cheesy!  An instant favorite at our house!"
200712,25096,9/1/2005,5,Awesome!!  A definite keeper and very flavorful.  I substituted mushrooms for the onions and added onion powder.  Received rave reviews from family.
177074,25096,12/20/2005,5,"Yummy, yummy, yummy!  Made it for company and everyone loved it.  We'll definitely be making this one again... and again... and again."
141293,25096,2/23/2006,5,I had a rosemary tortilla that I wanted to use in something that would not compete with the flavors.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I added mushrooms and used a vege cream cheese.  Also used fat free half and half.  Simple and delicious.
844554,296082,1/27/2012,5,This turned out very good for us. I love the fact that there's not butter in the recipe. The flavor wasn't overwhelming but still delicious. YUM!
92816,25096,12/17/2006,5,"These are so delicious!I scaled it down to 4 servings.I used 4 torillas,4 oz of cream cheese and omitted the red peppers,just not a favorite of mine.I also substituted sour cream for the heavy cream.I will be making these again for sure.Thanks for posting!"
1623265,25096,11/15/2010,4,I thought this would be a great introduction to enchiladas for my kid. My last attempt was too spicy for him and I did not want to use cream of chicken/mushroom soup.  He liked it and would eat it again providing I lose the onions and pepper. I used burrito size tortillas. I think that if I do it again I will use a smaller tortilla. <br/><br/>The most fantastic part of this dish is that the vast majority of it can be done the night before. Thank you.
531310,25096,12/7/2013,5,These are the best Enchiladas I have ever tasted!
123581,60467,1/26/2004,5,"It was awesome, just like what I had as a little girl. It was also very quick, easy, and low-cost. "
135880,60467,4/2/2004,5,"We had a potluck with a German theme, so I was surfing the net looking for something easy to make. My boyfriend made it, and he doesn't know how to cook that good, but he did a great job and everyone love it...."
4439,60467,4/5/2004,5,"Jewish Soul Food!!! My mom is from Germany and she never, ever made a kugel. I learned to appreciate kugel when I married Peter Pan and his mother made one for dinner. This is almost like her's, but better. "
163358,60467,9/17/2004,5,"I loved this recipe!  Easy, no hassles or chopping, hard to mess up!  Tasted great - my whole family loved it and couldn't believe I made it!  Made our Rosh Hashanah much sweeter!"
115005,60467,2/8/2005,4,very easy to make! Made it for my German mom and added cinnamon (which she loves) and vanilla...she was very happy with it as were my children and neighbors. A very comforting food that I will certainly make again and again. For a slightly healthier breakfast/brunch I will try substituting some egg whites for some of the whole eggs and cut the butter maybe in half next time.
221408,60467,6/7/2005,5,I'm from dresden and i loved the recipe! It reminded me of my Oma (grandmother) when i was little and she used to make it when i would visit her in Mainz during Christmas time. It made her happy when I was able to make it for her even though now she is unable to move from her bett.
354758,60467,10/4/2006,5,"This is one foolproof recipe! It worked PERFECTLY the first time I made it for friends! Next time, I believe I will try adding some almond or vanilla extract or cinnamon. Frankly, I was initially uncertain about the corn flakes. I am glad I followed the recipe to the letter! My friends said that it was the best kugel they ever had!"
328048,60467,3/23/2007,4,"I decide to try this recipe after my husband complained that my usual noodle kugel was too sweet. This one was easy to put together, and tasted great. He liked it much better."
785503,60467,10/11/2008,4,"Simple and delicious.  Added vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg as suggested. Also used a mix of raisins, dried cranberries, and diced fresh apple. Served at our break fast to rave reviews."
264017,99057,6/18/2008,5,"Yummy, creamy chicken salad made easy as 123 right here! I made it just as stated with the onions, peppers and celery and let the flavors meld overnight. It was great! This could be doctored up a bit with dill, sour cream or other veggies if desired, but this is a terrific basic start. Thanks Dougal03! MERP'd for My 3 Chefs '08."
228682,127367,7/12/2005,5,It is great with brown rice in place of the couscous as well! 
809828,127367,8/22/2008,5,I love sun-dried tomatoes and I love feta cheese.  This recipe was so flavorful!  Definitely will make again!
346860,127367,9/8/2008,5,"Sooo delectable. I used a cup of gently steamed asparagus rather than peas and mint as opposed to basil. I also used chicken broth in place of water for the cooking of the couscous. Incredible, delicious and perfect. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!"
339260,223830,9/10/2009,5,"I make sausage gravy a couple times a month, and this was a good recipe...but I did make a few changes.  I don't normally make this large a batch of gravy.  I used 2 pounds of Bob Evans Savory Sage Sausage.  I didn't boil the sausage because I think the grease from the sausage gives the gravy it's flavor.  Since I didn't drain the sausage grease, I didn't add the 1 1/2 cups of shortening.  I only used 1 3/4 cups of flour and 3/4 gallon of milk.  This gave me the perfect consistency for my tastes.  This was the first time I used Kitchen Bouquet in my sausage gravy, and I liked the flavor it gave.  I used some over biscuits and home fries and froze the rest.  Made for PAC Fall, 2009."
251917,343949,2/27/2009,5,Newest Zaar Tag 09: Delicious and easy to make!! I threw it all in the crockpot and dinner was ready when we got home!! YUM!
1500557,223830,1/25/2010,5,"I manage a busy, high-volume night club right outside of Denver, CO. Sometimes, after a particularly rough or very busy weekend, I like to feed the troops.

This recipe has been met with sterling reviews from my staff, and I'm able to feed about 40 people for 40 bucks (after buying Bisquik to make biscuits and all the ingredients here). It's a GREAT way to end the weekend and cheer up an overworked staff!

Thanks for sharing it with us!"

842531,269368,6/30/2008,5,"This is so yummy! My whole family really enjoyed it! Thanks so much, Rose"
316809,269368,11/12/2010,5,"This was absolutely delicious! I used 7-cheese tortellini from the fresh section, but forgot to cook it before making this dish. I just baked it an extra 10 minutes, and it was superb. My husband had seconds and commented that it was a really good meal (served with frozen peas). He had seconds. My only comment, which is not the recipe's fault, is to be careful of the ingredients you select because of the amount of combined salt. Next time I'll try to find a less salty dressing, since there's so much in the rotisserie chicken and cheeses. Otherwise, this promises to be a very versatile recipe that I'll use many times. Thanks for posting a great recipe!"
1142897,269368,12/1/2013,5,This was a simple and yummy dish!!
407007,269368,1/11/2014,5,"YUM! I used a similar recipe from Holly Clegg&#039;s &quot;Freezer Friendly&quot; cook book. I made it ahead of time, froze, and reheated it in the oven. Fantastic! I used whole wheat pasta, no green onions, light dressing, and low-fat cheese. It all tasted great! Next time I might add a little more dressing just to really bring that Caesar flavor up a notch. This is definitely a keeper -- thanks for sharing!"
2001022199,269368,7/19/2016,5,"This was absolutely delicious, I used on large chicken breast cooked in broth and tri colored bow tie pasta, definitely a keeper!!"
111899,273833,1/4/2008,5,"Excellent!  I made the sauce exactly as directed (but without sesame seeds--none in the pantry that day).  I used baby back ribs and they were tasty, tasty!  Will definitely make again, maybe with a little bit more red pepper flakes.  Served them with fried rice and mixed baby vegetables."
498271,283714,6/17/2008,5,"Great quick and easy lunch idea, and portable too!  I used roasted turkey breast and colby/jack cheese.  This was nice for lunch and tasty without the extra calories and carbs of bread.  Thanks for sharing your idea!"
623331,283714,10/28/2008,5,YUM!  I used smoked ham.  I didn't have the pickles so I used a pineapple chunk instead and mixed some cream cheese with the honey mustard.  It was absolutely delicious and the kids thought it was neat to eat off of a stick!
1056692,283714,8/18/2009,5,"Thank you for a great idea for my son's lunch!  He just started kindergarten this past week, and I threw these together so he could have something fun as a surprise in his lunch...  I did these with just meat and cheese, turkey and colby jack.  4 of these puppies fit perfectly in a snack size ziploc and that's a perfect meal size for my kiddo."
484436,283714,10/5/2009,5,Great idea. still have to try it out though but I m thinking.....ham+pinapple+cheese or cherry tomatoes+basil+cheese
199792,296082,5/16/2008,4,This is nicely seasoned shrimp. I think they would be better cooked in a skillet or on the grill as I felt they got a bit tough. Certainly easy and quick.
860079,296082,12/27/2008,5,"We really enjoyed this little recipe for our dinner tonight. I like that the flavors are not overwhelming in this dish. Very quick and easy to make. Thanks TeresaS for the great recipe. Made for Potluck Tag, Dec 2008"
383853,296082,1/11/2009,5,"Wow!  This was fantastic!  All of the flavors work so great together, and it's healthy!  It couldn't have been any easier to prepare either.  This is definitely going into my keeper file.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!  Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders Tag."
89549,296082,1/13/2009,4,"A good recipe, though I was a little disappointed in the flavor at first.  It's not your fault!  After tasting one when finished, I decided to drain the remaining sauce into a skillet and simmer it up to thicken it a bit.  I added some red pepper flakes, minced garlic, and another tablespoon of honey, to make it glaze better.  I poured that over the cooked shrimp, and all was well.
I think next time I will just cook these up in a skillet and save all the energy used to fire the oven to 450.  I think they will glaze up better in a skillet, too.  
Thanks for an inspirational recipe!"
386585,296082,2/2/2009,4,"I didn't know what to expect from reading the previous reviews, so I did prepare them in a skillet.  I thought there was enough flavor, as well.  I seem to enjoy garlic with my shrimp, though, and was missing that flavor.  Will probably add some next time.  Made for Potluck Tag Game."
54678,363434,12/28/2011,3,we added the ingredients to some leftover roasted red pepper butter we used on steaks and will have to try again with just plain butter
583577,450014,4/19/2011,4,Overall this was a very good recipe! I used white chocolate chips and pecans in place of the regular chocolate chips and coconut. My only complaint is that the bars were just a little bit too sweet for my tastes - I think they were pushed over the edge by the chocolate chips. Next time I will use 1/2 cup of nuts and no chocolate chips at all and I think I will enjoy that much more! I really loved the texture though - soft and chewy is very true!! Thanks for sharing this recipe - I think it will become a staple at my house!

85228,28155,2/7/2004,5,"Wow! This recipe is fantastic!  This afternoon I made the dough in my machine and then shaped it into 10 ""hamburger"" style rolls to use for pulled pork sandwiches.  These are absolutely the lightest, most tasty rolls I have ever made.  After shaping them and letting them rise, they baked for 15 minutes on 375.  They came out looking and feeling like a professional bakery made them.  Thanks so much for posting this, it is going in my personal collection! :)"
444622,28155,6/5/2007,4,"This bread is really moist and light, baked up beautifully in my bread maker. A mild onion flavor but not a lot of the cheese flavor came thru. Next time I would add about another 1/2 cup of cheese and see how that worked out. A nice bread for sandwiches!"
135470,61912,11/17/2008,4,"Simple and delish, I made my hot chocolate with milk - DH says it's the only way- and skipped, the topping as I only use real whipped cream and we were out.

Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup tag game."
180898,90448,1/4/2005,5,"I make this often, comfort food to me. Great for lunch on a cold day. The only things I do differantly is 1. I like to cut the nori into matchstick size strips and sprinkle over the top. 2. I have never used corriander but will next time. 3. Sometimes I will steam the salmon with the rice (as is done in Japan)or when doing this for lunch thoes new tuna steaks they sell now in a pouch are nice (a little dry but good for a quick lunch). If available sushimi is a nice topper too. 4. Sometimes I will use a flavored green tea. Mandarin orange flavored is nice with a pice of fish that was steamed with mandarin oringe slices, for example. I do this often with leftover sushi rice or will usually make extra Jasmine rice (my fave) at dinner time for lunch the next day. "
139977,90448,6/8/2009,2,"Didn't really like it. It doesn't have much flavor. Maybe it needs some type of seasoning other than the green tea, like salt or bonito."
2000250077,90448,6/8/2015,4,"FYI: in Japan, this is generally thought of as &quot;comfort food for when you&#039;re sick&quot;...so it&#039;s meant to be easy on the stomach, not per se, super flavorful.  However, if you&#039;re not sick add more flavor by way of more flavorful (perhaps marinated) meat or adding nori/seaweed that has added &quot;oompf&quot;...if the later, I recommend furukake, which can be found in specialty Asian shops (if you don&#039;t live in Hawaii, or in coastal big cities like San Francisco or LA) or in the Asian section of your local grocery store/supermarket (if you do)."
126032,116241,5/13/2005,5,This was good!  I knew I had to make it since I had all the ingredients on hand (that rarely happens!).  I also added a little Adobo seasoning - it mixed nicely with all the other seasonings.  Thanks Parsley72!
89831,116241,8/11/2007,5,"this was really good, I had to use more mayo then stated and omitted the cilantro, also I used yellow onions in place of the green and increased the spices, thanks for sharing hon!...Kitten:)"
353579,116241,7/2/2008,5,"Yummy potato salad - lots of great flavors and textures.  I added a splash of vinegar, added the spices with a heavy hand and added half a chopped jalapeno.  Thanks for posting!"
664225,116241,4/14/2009,5,I omitted the cilantro (personal preference) and used sweet vadalia onions instead of green onions.  I let the flavors mix together by setting in the fridge for about 8 hrs. before serving.  We really enjoyed it with our Jalapeno burgers!
121690,138783,6/29/2007,5,"What a wonderful combination. My sister, who is not a Recipezaar member, downloaded this salad recipe and made it for us yesterday evening and it was a big hit. Second helpings were had all around. The sweet juiciness of the melon, the saltiness of the cheese and the bite of the onions make for a sublime mouthful of taste experiences. Bravo!"
465056,138783,7/18/2007,3,It was fairly good but I didnt like the bread.  Maybe mine wasnt stale enough but it turned kind of slimey.
196369,148767,1/10/2006,5,"If you are looking for a ""very special"" supper entree to prepare for your spouse on a special occasion, this has to be among the top choices. The flavor is delicious and the presentation is quite impressive.
I made one change to the recipe -- at the last moment, I chose to use imitation crabmeat (roughly chopped) and it turned out just great.
I would make (DID make) three amendments to the recipe to make life easier for the next chef who takes this one on. The first is, an old chicken frying trick -- after dusting the stuffed breasts (pat them dry with a paper towel!)  with flour, let them sit aside for 1/2 an hour or so before further drenching and dredging. This makes the coating stick MUCH better to the chicken. I did this and all the coating stayed firmly attached during the frying and subsequent baking process. The second is, you will NOT need 7 cups of bread crumbs -- you can easily get away with half that amount or even less, keeping the other ""dredge"" ingredients the same. The third is, because I was using bone-in Breasts (I cut off the ""rib"" section), I increased the baking time to about 55  minutes and the chicken was still very tender and juicy.  
Now, as for flavor, this is the perfect meld of chicken and seafood (which can otherwise be tricky). I made up the filling on the night before and it was so munchable, I had difficulty resisting just eating it all on crackers! I will say that this is probably not a dish for kids who are enamored with McDonald's. This is an elegant entree for those who enjoy fine dining -- and fine it was!
Great recipe, Kitz -- you've done it again!"
646304,148767,4/2/2008,5,Now this wowed the company! thanks so much for sharing.  used a lb of crabmeat and bit more cream cheese.  YUM YUM
2588901,148767,12/24/2012,4,Just finished making the filling and just popped it in the refrigerator overnight. Followed the directions to the letter and the filling alone is delicious. Must try!
344231,172046,5/11/2007,4,"Made for PAC (Spring 2007). It tasted really good but I wonder if I did something wrong because I found it too soggy (and I dislike soggy bread). Husband and daughter liked it and would have given it a 4 and dh fussed at me for giving it a 3...so I'm back to fix things.  He said it was delicious and I just have a mental block because the bread was ""soggy"".  The flavor was absolutely yummy. I will likely try this again but not put so much of the chicken broth.  Thanks for posting this DancesinGarden."
156034,184624,9/5/2006,4,"QUICK, EASY and oh so good!!  I had a recipe similar to this one and lost it.

THANKS FOR SHARING MISS DIGGY!!"
485658,184624,2/19/2008,4,"Was I supposed to thaw the potatoes first? When it came out of the oven, all the potatoes were still in a lump in the middle of the baking dish and everything else was melted and gooey. I ended up just stirring it all together. The taste was great, but it messed up the lovely crunchy, cheesy top."

250354,184624,2/9/2009,5,YUMMY YUMMY. I love cheese and these were perfect. I ate them breakfast lunch and dinner for the next two days! I actually cooked mine in the crock pot and they turned out AWESOME. Thanks for posting!
107583,199488,1/5/2007,5,"WOW!  What a nice bread to go with a hot bowl of soup on yet another stormy night in Seattle!  I used a Pumpkin Ale, which is kind of dark, with a nice flavor!  Thanks, KelBel, for posting!  This was made for your win in the football game!"
221044,199488,5/22/2007,5,"Wonderful 8-).  All of my favorite things on one bread.  Next time, I'll increase the onions a bit and double the cheese.  Way yummy - THANKS, KelBel!"
581949,199488,9/8/2007,5,Made this for California State fair. Got a blue ribbon.!
20754,199488,11/5/2007,5,I Love Asiago Cheese!  This bread is delicious!  It is so easy to make! Thanks KelBel
185142,199488,1/27/2008,5,Absolutely delicious. I made 2 loaves and they disappeared.
389215,199488,4/28/2008,5,This was soooo good and very easy to put together.  I will be making this again and again!
517533,199488,1/22/2009,5,This was sooo easy to make and tasted great too. My loaf came out very dense so that's one thing to keep in mind. Thanks a lot KelBel!
690623,199488,1/27/2009,5,"Let me start by saying that I do not bake a great deal and have never before made a 'beer' anything!  I wanted to make this to go with tonights beef stew.  I followed all instructions muttering to the dogs ""this is not going to work"".  No fat, no eggs, no yeast, oh well ...soldier on.  I added the beer and had the eureka moment.  AHHHHH yeast in beer!
Took it out of the oven and left it to cool while I walked the critters in sub zero weather.  Came back to the amazing aroma and decided that I'd give it a shot warm, smeared with butter and a cup of tea.  I've had four slices - now my tummy aches and I have no interest in the stew.  DH is going to love it providing there is any left for dinner.  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe."
60989,199488,2/23/2009,5,This is to die for. A nice dense loaf of very flavorable bread. My husband went insane over this. Went great with our stew. Thanks!
117440,199488,2/25/2009,5,"OK, I am ~Bekah~'s hubby and have to say this was the most delicious bread.  I absolutely loved it and think that anyone who makes it will enjoy it.  Thanks for a great treat!"
781732,199488,10/26/2009,5,No need to elaborate... EXCELLENT! Leaps and bounds better than any other! Thank you for a wonderful recipe that our entire family enjoyed!
60992,199488,12/11/2009,5,"This bread kicks beeer bread into areas previously unknown, and does so beautifully. The bread is not at all crumbly, has a moist beautiful texture and the additions of asiago and caramelized onions bring the flavor over the top. Hands down the BEST beer bread I have ever had."
719313,199488,1/7/2010,5,"Absolutely loved this bread! Very nice crusty bread that will go great with so many different dishes. I know it's early in the year, but this is the first recipe going into my Favorites of 2010 cookbook!"
1228804,199488,6/2/2010,4,"This bread is absolutely delicious.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because there is no info about how to carmelize onions - and some beginners may not be familiar with that process!  The onions need to be cooked at medium-high heat for ten minutes before reducing heat to medium.  Continue to cook the onions for another 15-20 minutes until they are brown, sticky and delicious... Add them to this wonderful and easy bread recipe and enjoy!"
145352,199488,1/31/2011,5,These were really good. Love the sweet onions.
135887,199488,2/27/2011,5,Fabulous!  Easy to make and yummy.  Made as directed and have shared the recipe with several friends already!
1800050059,199488,11/25/2016,5,I ran out of time on Thanksgiving and my yeast rolls weren't going to happen. I stumbled upon this recipe just googling what I could make for a quicker option with what I had on hand. THIS IS CRAZY DELICIOUS BREAD THAT STOLE THE SHOW. I didn't change or tweak anything and it pairs really nice with more savory as well as slightly sweeter foods. I think it would be a great addition to a cheese plate as well.
459415,219526,5/2/2007,4,Man this cake was moist and just so good. I had substituted the Dr. Pepper for orange crush...... and it was really good! Thanks for the recipe!
608913,219526,12/27/2007,5,I made this for Christmas and it turned out well. I made a second cake using orange cola in the place of dr. pepper and it was delicious also.
2206954,219526,3/10/2012,5,"I made this cake for a super bowl party. My family loved it! For frosting/glaze, I used one can of vanilla frosting, added one 2 tsp. of maraschino cherry juice and 2tbsp. Dr. Pepper. I spread this over the cake while it was still warm, then placed cherries all around the top. They all loved the pink...even my grandsons! We used Diet Cherry Dr. Pepper for  the second cake. Delicious!"
33159,219526,1/26/2013,4,"A really,nice rich cake but the Dr. Pepper flavour doesn't come through at all.  We actually thought this tasted a lot like a sour cream glazed doughnut."
2705092,219526,2/21/2013,4,I didn't have Dr. Pepper so I used Diet A&W Root Beer. You couldn't taste the root beer but it was still very good. The cake is so moist and rich. Next time I'm going to try orange pop.
140132,219526,6/17/2013,5,"We made this for our Fathers Day dessert.  DH is a huge DP fan so DS thought this was the perfect cake.  It really is delicious, but like other reviewers we didn&#039;t taste the DP in it.  But, no matter cuz we fell in love with this moist flavorful cake.  DH thought it tasted like a butter pecan cake.  So good.  Thank you for sharing with us."
115758,235273,9/19/2007,5,This was great! I used one large onion and 2 tsp of a Mexican Chili Blend spice mix. My DD skipped on the beef mixture as she is a vego and really enjoyed it also. Thanks for sharing! A Tostada was new experience for my family.
461834,235273,10/23/2007,5,"I just loved the added kidney beans to the tostada!!!  I also love the flavor of the crispy torilla so much better than bought taco shells/tostada.  I followed the directions as far as ingredients except omitted the avocado, personal preference.  What I did different was to drain the can of beans in the collander and set them aside, I browned the beef with the onion and garlic and then drained.  I then returned the beef mixture and beans to pan, added salt, chili powder and pepper.  I then added in about a 1/2 cup of water in order to cooked the beans and the spices into the mixture, then removed from heat once water was evaporated.  This made for a wonderful Sunday football lunch!!!!"
374520,235273,10/31/2007,4,This was really good and easy to make.  Next time I will season the meat a bit more.  We like things kinda spicy.  Thank you so much for posting a quick easy dinner.
145352,235273,11/15/2007,4,Very good. I've never had tostadas on flour tortillas. It was very yummy!!!!!
131126,235273,6/28/2008,5,This made a quick & easy lunch.  I did make a few changes to utilize what was on hand.  I used a cup of frozen pinto beans instead of the canned and mashed them to a spreadable like consistency.  I subbed ground turkey &  added 1 t ground cumin and a chipolte pepper.  I also sprayed the flour tortillas with cooking spray & baked them.  Everything was topped with Recipe #182266 Made for ZWT4.
88099,235273,11/16/2008,4,"This was very nice for dinner tonight.  I also made a few changes with what I had on hand.  I thought the meat needed a little something extra so added a tablespoon of taco seasoning.  I didn't heat the beans.  I, like SusieD, sprayed the wheat tortillas with cooking spray and baked them at 450 for about 6 minutes.  That seemed to work well.  And for the sour cream and taco sauce, I mixed them together to make a nice dressing.  Very nice.  Thanks and Congratulation on your football win last week."
780172,235273,5/22/2009,4,"These were easy to prepare, lots of nice fresh ingredients. Only thing I would change is a little zing, they need to be spicer. Made for ZWT5."
169430,235273,8/6/2012,5,To make this more diabetic friendly I used veggie crumbles in place of the beef and added a good dose of Mexican Seasoning. No kidney beans on hand so I used black beans. All else was pretty much as ask with fat free sour cream and spicy salsa. Lovely on a hot summer evening. Made for ZWT8.
488441,235273,2/6/2013,5,I made this with black beans since we like them better and added cilantro and squeezed lemon juice right on top right before serving. Outstanding! Made for Super Bowl 2013 win by Maryland Jim....
242766,235273,2/19/2013,5,"This was super quick and easy to make, so it was perfect for a busy weeknight dinner.  I doubled the spices for the meat and also added some cumin and black pepper.  Instead of the kidney beans, I used refried beans to which I added some salsa.  I put the refried beans on the tortilla first, followed by the meat mixture, the vegetables,  4-cheese Mexican blend, sour cream and taco sauce...yum!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.<br/>**Made for 2012 Football Pool**"

I Loved this simple tasty soup!
It was so simple to prepare and it was hearty, satisfying and delicious."
160974,239666,8/9/2007,5,"My bread turned out exactly as you described, fluffy on the inside, with a chewy crust, just like a good bakery bread. I mixed the dough (used bread flour) in the bread machine (didn't need the extra 2 tbs flour). It is not difficult to make (similar to a foccacia)and the dough is so springy and full of bounce. We used the bread to make delicious meatloaf sandwiches and I bet the leftovers would make some great French toast or garlic bread. I'd like to try this as pizza dough, too! It's  great to know that It felt neat to be able to   make a good Italian bread (that looked like your photo, too). Thanks Andypandy, for posting.

130819,239666,8/17/2007,5,We enjoy those specialty loaves of bread that one picks up at the bakery and this is very much like one we often buy - have to agree this Vienna bread definitely has more flavor. It's a bread lovers bread and so worth the making. I mixed and kneaded by hand to get the feel of the dough - now  that I know what it should look like I will try the bread maker next time around. Thank you for sharing - your recipe and the for the  excellent step by step instructions.
1858347,239666,1/27/2014,0,"This was amazing, everyone in my family loved it."
1803060179,239666,7/22/2015,1,"This is possible the worst bread recipe I have ever come across.  I followed the directions explicitaly yet the bread making process is was horrific and the bread itself was terrible.  I have won many bread making contests.  I will never use this recipe again as it now stands.  I think the author of this particular recipe needs to check out the quantities of ingredients used in it are incorrect.  Sincerely, The Moom"

226066,256214,1/16/2008,5,This is so :yummy:!!  Used chicken breasts instead of drumsticks... and had to change par of the barbecue sauce for... ketchup as I didn't have enough!!  This was sooo good!!!  Thanks mariposa!! :)
362983,256214,4/28/2008,5,"So tasty and easy. It took about 50 minutes for the chicken to finish, but the sauce was still really thin, almost like water. Next time I'd probably remove the chicken and give the sauce more time to thicken, or just use a cornstarch/water mixture to help with that. I forgot the sesame seeds too but I'll just have to remember to add that next time :) Everyone enjoyed it and loved the sauce. Thanks!"
138799,330830,11/1/2008,5,"Delicious! Although mine came out pretty thick and more like a ghoulash type dish, we still loved it! I may have added a wee bit too much pasta and that''s why the juice was quickly disappearing, ( I did add extra V8 as well, but didn't want to use too much and mess with my spices being diluted down)  but we loved the overall flavor and will definitely make this one again!
Thanks for sharing!  Made for My 3 Chefs Fall 08'"
895132,362396,2/27/2010,5,"Very yummy indeed! I was out of quinoa so used amaranth, which works pretty much the same. Scaled it down to one serving and used only 1 teaspoon honey - delicious, a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

47892,362396,8/16/2011,5,Made my own brown rice cereal by grinding raw long grain rice<br/>in a spice grinder. Used local blackberry honey. I have a difficult time<br/>passing up any recipe with cardamom and saffron. Served with a splash<br/>of plain kefir. Mmmm! Thanks for posting! Reviewed for NA*ME tag. Come play!
599450,362396,2/10/2013,5,"This was such a nice change for breakfast. I had never rinsed quinoa before and my package had recipes that didn't suggest it, but I tried it anyway and would do it again for this recipe. My local grocer doesn't carry cream of brown rice cereal so I used cream of rice cereal. The pinch of saffron was a delight to the eye as well as the palate. I look forward to making this again. Thanks, UmmBinat! Made for Veggie/NA*ME tag game."
44393,399786,1/8/2010,4,"DH and I really enjoyed this recipe and I will definitely be making it again. I did alter it a bit by using tomato sauce instead of puree, using toated bulkie rolls instead of corn bread but that was it."
498271,484603,2/27/2013,5,Terrific recipe!  I wanted the bread to get nice and crispy so I let the cheese get a little gooey but that was ok - it was delicious!  The oil/lemon/oregano really makes this great; I made a little extra to make sure I had enough to brush over the kebabs after brushing on the bread.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!
59780,19831,1/22/2007,5,I was looking for a salt-free and sugar-free marinade to give to my inlaws as part of a BBQ gift basket and this was perfect! Thanks!
8688,21569,5/14/2003,5,"Rhonda, your corned beef brisket turned out quite moist and juicy, made exactly according to your instructions.  I have been making corned beef brisket for a long, long time and have become used to the standard spices that I use normally (bay leaves, peppercorns, etc).  I'm sure that there are many who will enjoy the flavor of the apple juice, brown sugar and orange rind. Although, I am always willing to try new dishes, sometimes they do not always work out for me.  I guess I am an old die-hard traditionalist."
41809,21569,2/8/2004,5,"We were very impressed with this corned beef recipe!  
I followed your easy directions, and it came out moist and tasty...The ingredients sounded unusual, but, it all blended together to make a very tasty dish...
Next time, I'd like to try adding the cabbage wedges about the last hour of cooking...Think it would result in a ""crisper"" veggie...
We really enjoyed this easy, and trouble-free recipe, Rhonda...
Thanks so much for sharing...
Laudee"
168037,21569,11/17/2004,0,Yum! This was a great meal. I will definitely make it again. Adding the cabbage during the last hour of cooking kept it from getting too mushy.
236470,21569,8/20/2005,4,i am a big corned beef and cabbage fan-----coming from eastern canada  it is a common dish there.  your receipe  was very good-------thank you.
199848,21569,3/18/2009,5,"Wonderful flavor and easy to prepare.  I made this just as written, cooking on high for about 5 hours.  My cabbage was cooked perfectly and not mushy.  Thanx for a great meal!  I'll make this again."
844554,21569,6/21/2010,5,This is the only way I've ever cooked corned beef and cabbage. It turns out so moist and tasty and no stinky smell either. Thanks for posting it.
1010982,21569,9/17/2010,3,"I tried this recipe last night, made it exactly to directions with exception for doubling to fill 2 crockpots and left out the onions and added red skinned potatoes and baby carrots.  the meat and carrots and potatoes tasted very good.  However, the cabbage tasted strongly of clove and noone that tried it liked it.  Anyone want to point out what I did wrong?  Thank you."
2001420907,21569,3/6/2017,0,"Going to try. I also cook in garage.The smell does not disapate,from the cooking,for 2days."
1042583,22061,11/24/2008,5,This has become a family favorite at the Holidays. Ohhh... Soooo... Good! Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.
201576,123038,5/26/2005,4,This is a great tasting recipe great for a summertime bbq or a family dinner. GIve it a try the taste won't disapoint you!
4740,123038,3/12/2006,5,Good stuff.  I usually use raisins and I don't use sunflower seeds.
6258,123038,7/18/2007,4,"This is a very tasty recipe.  I loved the combination of flavors, especially the cranberries and bacon.  Salty/Sweet is always a wonderful treat for me.  I made this with the sunflower seeds, but I toasted them first.  The dressing is similar to the one I use on my cole slaw, and it was wonderful here in this salad.  Every ingredient in this salad is a must.  Definately a dish to repeat!  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe."
175574,123038,10/8/2007,4,"I've had this recipe at picnics and wanted to make it myself, we had it with barbecue pork, freshly made apple sauce and gooseberry pie for dessert. This salad is a wonderful accompaniment to picnic menu (indoor or outdoor)  I also added to the broccoli by adding one package of the shredded broccoli slaw (for color and more shapes and textures) very tasty dish, and easy to make!"
916115,123038,6/6/2012,5,"Such a yummy dish!!  I just added green onions instead of red, L.O.V.E. it!!!!!"
99325,153263,5/30/2006,0,"This is an interesting recipe, but I don't think the results qualify as madeleines. *Larousse Gastronomique* defines madeleines as ""a small cake shaped like a rounded shell."" I followed the directions exactly, and I did not get cakes. What this recipe did produce is something more cookie-like. In fact, it reminds me of some of the Italian cookies I had when I was a child. They're good, but not madeleines. 

I wonder about the order of the directions given here, too. Why fold in flour, and THEN add the cooled butter?  While mixing in flour I quickly ran out of liquid and the dough became hard to mix - had to use my fingers for this. Then adding butter after? Well, there's this dough, splooshing around in butter. Hard to mix in butter at that point, so, hmmm. Very odd."
172369,156341,2/26/2006,5,"Made as directed. Great flavor, this is one to keep in the spice cabinet, I will never eat steak without it.
Thanks Rita L."
330545,156341,6/13/2007,5,Made your seasoning and tried it out on recipe#156341.  My son's the BBQ chef in our family and he took the rest to be used on ribs this coming weekend.  I'll update then.
192581,156341,7/9/2007,5,"My first attempt at this type of seasoning, and I thought this particular recipe was subtle and definitely not too hot.  I rubbed on tofu which I pressed overnight.  Then I added some additional lime sauce to grill.  My recommendation is to add lime sauce for soak overnight, but I really loved this anyway.  I compared to Rita's cajun seasoning, and the cajun was hotter but the jerk was tastier.  Thanks Rita, looking forward to inventive ways to use leftovers (including on veggies)!"
227652,156341,9/23/2007,4,"This is very good; I put it on some sliced zucchini for a side dish but beware-don't use too much as I did & it was too hot for my sensitive tongue! I even cut the cayenne in half-but I am a little wimpy with the hotness :-). I also cut the chives, sugar & black pepper in half-and used a lot less salt. Will try this on chicken!"
137165,156341,12/12/2007,5,I put this on some chicken drumsticks and thighs that I rubbed with olive oil and then grilled them. They disappeared before the beer was all drank up. This is THE best Jerk seasoning that I have had.
37449,156341,12/23/2007,5,"Wonderful, spicy flavors! My son has Jamaican friends and they love to get together and make their own jerk mixes, so I will give this to him for Christmas! Thanks Rita!"
95241,156341,3/8/2008,5,Great stuff!
485728,156341,10/13/2008,5,This is a wonderful seasoning!  I used it in a recipe calling for jerk seasoning.  I will definitely make some more up to keep in my pantry.  Thanks for posting!
465829,156341,1/25/2009,5,"This is an excellent jerk seasoning. I used it for Recipe #296358. I knew there was no point in going out to buy seasoning when I could find something better and fresher right here. I made this exactly as directed, which is a stretch for me. It is perfect as it stands with all spices I have in my pantry right now. Thanks so much Rita! :)"
321999,156341,3/8/2009,4,"Very good, not as spicy as I thought it would be.  I used it on some grilled vegetables and they had a very nice flavor, but were not spicy.  Thanks."
283834,156341,5/26/2009,4,This is pretty darn good seasoning! I made it with grilled chicken and the flavor was wonderful. Nice way to make chicken different. I can't wait to try this on some veges or steak! Made for ZWT 5 - Jammin Java Jivers
323186,156341,6/4/2009,5,"Very good and very easy!  I adore the smell, and it tastes wonderful!   I made this to use very successfully with Recipe #155037.

Made for ZWT 5 - Jammin Java Jivers"
247152,156341,6/4/2009,5,This was really good. I left out the thyme because I recently realized that I don't care for it. I used this seasoning for recipe #156500 and I'm looking forward to using the leftover seasoning! Made for ZWT5.
463435,156341,7/6/2009,5,"Rita, what can I say other then WOW! With it being so hot here and our AC being out, I wanted something light and simple for dinner that wouldn't heat up the house. I made a batch of chicken salad then decided to kick it up a notch so I added your seasoning blend it was wonderful! I can't wait to try it on other dishes. Made and reviewed for the 12th Veg*n Swap."
870390,156341,10/25/2009,5,"perfectly delicious, thanks!"
726052,156341,10/28/2009,5,Hands down simply the best!!!!!  Oh my holy wow this stuff is good!!  Way better than the crap you can buy at the store that has msg in it.  Made exactly as in the recipe and lovin' it!
790962,156341,11/19/2010,4,"Well, for the most part I liked this.  I tried it on some chicken breasts and it just didn't have that sweet heat that jerk seasoning should have.  I ended up making a glaze out of pureed pineapple with a bit of sriracha mixed in and brushing that over the chicken breasts a minute or so before they came off the heat.  The spice mix has plenty of the spicy heat to it, but not that sweetness that I would expect.  I'll probably try it again but add more brown sugar and tweak the rest of the ingredients up and down a bit."
212497,156341,8/2/2011,5,"This was really good. It wasn't quite what I was used to buying from the store but it was still good. On the other hand, my husband is a HUGE fan. He's been putting it on everything that goes on the grill and it's been wonderful. Thank you for posting!"
280271,156341,1/27/2012,5,A nice touch of heat and great flavor...I made half the recipe...and omitted the dried chives...cuz I didn't have any so used a touch of fresh with my fish I made for dinner...I have plenty left for using on my future meals. Thanks for posting it! :)
2897248,156341,7/10/2013,5,This was a good solid recipe for jerk chicken spice. I actually used it for a vegetarian dish with cabbage and mayacoba beans. Served over brown rice. Excellent!
2001730264,156341,9/25/2017,5,"Really good! I added 1/8 tsp of my own smoked Trinidad Moruga Scorpion pepper powder and the heat and smokiness was wonderful! I mixed in a couple tablespoon of vinegar to make a paste and then smeared it on some burgers before grilling them up. The result is a really awesome crunchy salty, sweet outer coating to the burger. Great stuff! This recipe was enough to coat #4 , quarter pound burgers."
2002211716,156341,7/8/2018,5,This was a awesome blend for Jerk seasoning I like it a tad hotter so I doubled Pepper flakes and cayenne pepper turned some of the best I had ever had
2001501999,156341,8/18/2018,5,This rub was awesome sprinkled it on cubes chicken breast saut&eacute;ed in olive oil along with mini red and orange pepper rings and onions. Will definitely serve again
324390,190298,10/31/2006,4,"This was a nice filling soup. I usually use rice in my albondigas but the tortillas were a change that worked well. The chilis and cumin made a flavorful broth.  I used ""80% lean ground beef"" and would suggest using a leaner beef as the broth became a little greasy after the meatballs cooked in it. We added a squeeze of lime to our bowls and it made a nice dinner for an autumn night. "
47559,190298,8/5/2012,5,"It's Hatch chile season, which only lasts a few weeks, and this was the perfect way to use some.  I charred them under the broiler and wrapped in foil until cool enough to handle.  The skins peeled off very easily.  This batch wasn't very spicy/hot, so I added 2 jalapeno's from the garden.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I wouldn't change a thing.  The soup was excellent!  Made for ZWT 8."
341142,196312,12/12/2006,5,A really great fruit punch.
128473,196312,3/28/2007,5,"We enjoyed this nice tropical fruit punch Engrossed. I used spiced apple cider, blood orange juice, jamacian gingerbeer and the 1/4 cup passion fruit juice.
(I used what I had in the house that I wanted to use up). The punch was exotic tasting with a tart punch. Thanks so much for sharing."
424680,196312,3/30/2007,4,"Very nice tasting punch! I'm not a really big fan of ginger ale, so used an additional 1/3 cup of each of the first 3 juices, then used only 1 cup of ginger ale! Thanks for this easy-to-make beverage recipe!"
422893,196312,4/21/2007,3,"This was okay but I wasn't overly taken with it. It tastes very similar to a fruit punch we can get in a can here in Oz so I think that's why I'm not too fussed with it, sorry!"
465056,196312,10/8/2007,4,I think the passion fruit was a bit too much.  Otherwise it was good.
591748,214031,2/19/2008,0,very easy. Not like those bring to a boil and stand in your kitchen 4 hours kinda recipe
254614,214031,2/20/2008,5,Excellent! Fast & Easy. Sometimes I add chopped fresh mushrooms after the eggs and a little more chicken broth. But this as written is quick good and good for you.
191050,217875,9/16/2007,5,"I enjoyed this chicken very much!  The lemon flavor was outstanding and all of the indredients really complimented each other well- especially the wine!  The only difference I made was that I used lemon zest since I couldn't find lemongrass and I used a boneless, skinless chicken breast instead of a whole chicken (just cooking for me tonight)!  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Fall PAC 2007."
357358,278288,1/13/2008,4,"My, my, my. This is a definite change of pace! My store had no jarred mangoes so I had to substitute peaches but they worked well. This is a lot like having dessert on a tortilla chip. Don't taste this expecting traditional salsa flavors, that will just confuse your taste buds. Instead, think fruitsauce with kick. Very pretty too. Thanks!"
537617,278288,1/16/2008,5,This stuff is addictive!  I love the salty sweet you get when you eat it with tortilla chips.  I could only find jalapeno jelly but it worked really well.  Thanks for a new twist on salsa!
498271,278288,10/12/2011,4,Very tasty and unusual salsa!  I couldn't find jarred mangos so I used fresh.  It seemed a bit odd to have salsa with no tomatoes but it really worked.  The sweet and spicy was great on a tortilla chip; I think it would be great on grilled chicken or fish as well.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for Fall Pick-A-Chef 2011
123871,300544,6/8/2011,5,These are easy and yummy!
870840,311436,7/23/2008,4,"Pretty good! I followed the recipe as follows making one change of using only about half the paprika. Not because I was doing something from experience, but rather I am a new cook who hasn't used much paprika and was a bit hesitant to put the whole 3 tablespoons in, not sure what it would do to the taste since it was already looking and smelling so good. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe there is something missing (more than the paprika I left out). I'm sure adding more salt would help but instead of having to use a lot of salt I'm hoping someone else can figure out a good additional ingredient to push this yummy recipe to a 5. I made it with uncle ben's white rice (my new fav. rice) adding a spoonful of cream cheese to the rice when fluffing at the end. If you've never tried that it's really good! I would have liked to have a good vggie on the side too but couldn't decide on one so I didn't make any! Anyway it tasted so good along side the rice I began to mix it up all together spreading the sauce and fish throughout the rice. Gasp!! Just looked at the recipe again.  I think I figured it out-I left out the OJ!!!  Well, problem solved.  That prob would have given it a 5.  But hey it was still really yummy without.  Good stuff. Keep experimenting Chef Jay in Atlanta, you done good! May Jesus bless your hands!"
704950,337573,11/18/2008,5,"This is sooooo fabulous!!!!  I have been waiting for a recipe to use some dried mushrooms that I had and this is great!!  I used 1 oz dried shiitake, 1/2 oz dried wood ear, and 1/2 oz dried oyster mushrooms.  Then I used fresh shiitake and portobello mushrooms.  I used chicken broth to reconstitute my dried mushrooms for even more flavor!!  Since I did that, I used unsalted butter.  Finally, I chose cognac over the madeira wine.  This mushroom soup is light and has many layers of flavor!! It is very beautiful too!! I love this recipe, will definitely make again!!  Thanks for posting!!"
239758,346518,5/21/2010,5,"Love this soup -- it's chock full of some of my favourite ingredients, and so quick and easy-to-make. I decided to cook it on the stovetop and was serving it up within 45 minutes. I made two tiny changes -- added one chopped brown onion and doubled the amount of chicken stock for a soupier consistency. Made and enjoyed for ZWT6."
477411,346518,5/27/2010,4,"Very good soup, however I let my cheese hating boyfriend pick up the cheese, and I think it might have been a little over powering. So pick a mild - medium blue cheese. Here's a tip I had to relearn the hard way.  When blending hot liquids, use small amounts cover with a tea towel and hold on for dear life... or reclean the entire kitchen >_< Made for ZWT 6."
1222401,359137,3/31/2009,5,"This was a great dish!  I didn't have 5 tilapia fillets so I used 2 tilapia fillets and a mahi-mahi.  It was so good!  Crispy on the outside, flaky on the inside with the Italian spices and a hint of lemon.  I will definitely be making this one again!"
1220994,359137,4/4/2009,5,"This was awesome. Even my girls who hate fish ate it. As my kids say ""its a keeper"""
1019394,359137,4/6/2009,5,This is a gr8 dish... my 3 yr old daughter is a picky eater and this fish was a hit with her too.. she said it tastes just like nuggets... it's definitely a keeper
2931943,359137,8/5/2013,5,VERY easy to cook and delicious
220433,378143,9/22/2009,5,"Wow this was really good and so easy too. I followed the recipe and went with the Sweet Potatoes. They went well with the spices. I bought them at Trader Joe's already cut up into french fry sizes and just diced them a bit. I also used TJ's frozen pre-cooked rice (a 10 oz bag). The dish is so colorful when you mix it all together.

Thanks for the tip."
341170,378143,10/7/2009,3,"The flavours were great but the dish was partially soggy partially hard as a rock. The rice around the edges were very hard and the rice and veggies inside were very soft. I would make this again, but not in a crock pot. On the stove top for about 30-60 minutes would be better. I forgot the raisins but really want to remember them next time"
518581,378143,10/17/2009,4,"Pretty good!  The ingredients were very intriguing.  I used carrots and it came out very sweet, so I'll omit the sugar next time.  I have a 6 qt. crock pot so I just made sure to stir it often so it would cook evenly.  It did, but it still stuck to the pot pretty well.  I agree with another reviewer that this may be better on the stove top. Thanks for posting, I'll be making this again."
351614,390134,7/13/2010,5,"Mmmm! Delicious! No reason to spend the extra money on store-bought! This one's a winner! I did alter a few things: <br/><br/>I made a double batch (won't last long in my house!), <br/><br/>only did about 1/2 cup tahini for the entire double batch, <br/><br/>did 2 jalapenos per batch (because we like it hot!), <br/><br/>mixed in a sprinkling of cumin, <br/><br/>roasted my garlic and included a whole head of it,<br/><br/>did mostly lime juice with a little bit of lemon...<br/><br/>and didn't do any zest (we didn't have the fruits, so I just used the juice out of the bottles.). <br/><br/>I think it turned out great! Definitely has some kick, which is good!"
163112,460279,1/14/2012,5,"YUMM!!  Nuthin' wrong with mac & cheese with bacon & broccoli!!  I didn't have any peas so I left them out.  To make more for this piggish family, I doubled everything but the macaroni.  Just enough left over for breakfast on the run!  Deelicious.  I do wonder how cheese sauce compares with cream & eggs, tho, with the butter, milk & cheese sounds about equal.  Thanks for posting this yummy 'meal'.  Made for Aussie Swap 1/12."
93446,460279,1/15/2012,5,"I made this recipe to use up a few things in the fridge - leftover cooked broccoli, 1/2 cup whipping cream, a handful of grated cheddar, a few slices of bacon.  It smelled divine while cooking and tasted wonderful.  Instead of making a cream sauce, I blended the 1/2 cup of cream with 1/2 cup pasteurized egg whites and mixed the grated cheddar into the pasta mixture before spreading it in the baking dish.  I then topped the casserole with a couple handfuls of nacho blend cheese.  It was so good!  I have leftovers for another couple of meals, since it's just the two of us.  Can't wait to try it reheated!"
107583,232072,8/19/2007,5,"These are great!  Mosit and flavorful.  I used 1 cup Splenda and 2/3 cup sugar, and skipped the icing.  I added some toasted pumpkin seeds to the batter instead of the walnuts, and sprinkled the walnuts on top before baking, to replace the icing."
469903,232072,10/16/2007,5,"Super yummy and very moist like a good pumpkin bar should be! I also used 1 cup of splenda + 2/3 cup sugar and 1 can of canned pumpkin (not quite 2 cups) and the bars turned out great. The icing didn't work out for me, it went together all right, but was all melty by this morning. Not sure if the bars were too warm (felt cold to the touch), or if I just didn't get the right consistency when making it up. Still tasted great, but the icing kept sliding off.  Honestly, these bars are sooo good, they don't even really need the icing!"
842696,232072,9/12/2008,5,This is a great recipe even I had not tried this version but I modified this version to even lower the calories and exchanging ingredients for others and used Butternut Squash instead.  Great recipe!!  It is a great baseline and adding to it or just alone.. but one suggestion..needs vanilla extract to bring out the flavor...My dd did not even know she was eating healthy and she was surprised when I told her!!  She even requested again and said it was the best cake/bar I ever made!!
2001599081,232072,1/9/2018,5,One of my favorite recipes of all time. I do use sugar substitute and skip the frosting Thank you
336058,232074,6/15/2007,0,"Made for Zaar Tag, but I used homemade multigrain biscuit mix and dried minced onions (and no butter, as I didn't need to saute the onions).  Not too bad, but it came out salty, not sure why!  I think if it was made with biscuit mix made with white flour, it would be really tasty.  I'm glad I tried it though.  If I ever buy biscuit mix, I will try it again."
67103,232074,7/24/2007,5,"We thought this bread was wonderful!  It was light and moist with lots of flavor from the onions, cheddar and butter.  It was so easy to put together and we ate it with spaghetti.  Thanks for a great recipe, Kizzikate!"
283251,232074,9/15/2007,5,"This is fantastic. For some reason, I thought it was going to have more of a cornbread like consistancy. It was like a nice big biscuit. DH and DD both loved it. I reduced the amount of butter to 2 tablespoons, but otherwise followed the recipe. It made a very nice fluffy bread. I think I would like this more as individual biscuits. Made for PAC Fall 2007."
166642,232074,1/29/2009,5,Just wonderful! I am going to make this one a lot. It's so simple and so delicious! My family just loved it. Thanks for sharing.
65502,232074,5/4/2009,4,"This was easy and tasty! The onion added a nice flavour but wasn't overwhelming at all. It looked terrific and was perfectly cooked at 20 minutes. It was pretty crumbly though and we had to eat it with forks. Made for 1,2,3 Tag. Thanks!"
1105991,232074,5/4/2009,4,"This was quick, easy and tastey.  We enjoyed it.  Thanks for posting this one.  Made for 123 Hit Wonders game."
121690,232075,6/21/2007,5,"It turned out I only had about 1/2 cup worth of parmesan cheese on hand, so that's what I used, but it still tasted great."
197023,232075,3/7/2009,5,"A totally delicious spinach dish for serious spinach eaters!  :)  I wouldn't tire of eating spinach even if I ate it every day and just l-o-v-e discovering new super-easy spinach recipes for week nights! This recipe certainly did not disappoint: we LOVED it.  I omitted the celery seed as I had none on hand but included all the other ingredients.  I used low fat sour cream as I've always found that it in no way compromises the end result, and does lower the overall fat content.  My only additions were 4 cloves of minced garlic and about a teaspoon of cumin.  Bacon would taste wonderful in this, so I'll probably add that next time I make this.  Thank you, Kizzikate, for sharing this flavoursome recipe!   Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders."
377161,232075,3/16/2009,5,"This was just wonderful!! I also
omitted the celery seed and
added cumin and garlic. My
family all loved it --even the non
spinach eaters!! Thank you for a really great recipe and this will be made again!!"
482933,232075,7/6/2009,5,Easy peasy plus delicious!  Made as posted.   Mine turned out quite watery (did drain the cooked spinach for 30 minutes-and evidently it was not adequate-shows my lack of expertise with spinach-shame on me) next time I will squeeze it before assembling.  Thanks Kizzikate for sharing.  Made for 123 Hit Wonders.
444622,232076,7/22/2007,4,"What is not to love, sour cream, mayo, and dijon mustard!  :) I used the Tyson brand prepacked chicken and this came together so quickly. Loved the potato chip topping, all together a really nice casserole!"
498271,232076,2/4/2009,4,This is a nice casserole for a quick weeknight dinner.  Loved the potato chip and cheese topping.  I baked it at 350 for 15 minutes and I think it would have been better cooked a little longer.  All in all a recipe we enjoyed - thanks for posting it!
560491,232076,2/13/2009,4,Made for dinner last night...My 3yr old didn't like it but that is not saying much; DH and I did!  tasted a little like chicken salad and the chips added a very good salty crunch to it.  Was very quick and easy!  I boiled the chicken breasts and then shredded.  Will make again!
199953,232076,3/10/2009,5,"Fabulous! I make the original Cooking Light recipe, which has only 321 calories per serving and uses low-fat mayo, reduced-fat sour cream, 3/4 cup shredded Swiss Cheese, and only 2 oz of potato chips, as well as a can (8oz) of water chestnuts (drained and chopped. My whole family loves this casserole."
542159,232077,7/4/2009,4,"This got mixed reviews, the children enjoyed it, but the adults not so much. The light coating of coconut blend well with the apricots. Made for Aus/NZ Swap."
107135,232078,6/12/2007,5,very good soup
258285,232078,8/13/2007,4,Camera-less Chef Game #4:  Very nice!  I didn't make as much as there's only two of us.  The ginger gives it a nice 'zing'!  Thanks Kate!
623194,232078,10/29/2007,4,I added sweet potato to this and it was to die for!
38218,232078,9/4/2008,5,Lovely soup!  Got parsnips at the store--not a familiar veg for me.  Turned out really nice.  Had it lukewarm.  I wonder how it'll be cold...
341344,232078,1/10/2009,5,"Very delicious and beautiful soup!  I made this a day before eating, so the flavors had time to meld.  No changes - no need to!  

Thanks for a delicous parsnip recipe!"
448911,232078,7/18/2009,5,Hmm I just ate this for lunch and it was really good! Its winter here in oz right  now and just love having some homemade soup for an easy lunch or dinner and this was just perfect. I look forward to the leftovers over the next couple of days.
197023,232078,10/14/2009,5,A delicious soup: a great winter warmer and quick and easy to prepare!  I used a low-fat sour cream (which as always was wonderfully creamy!) but otherwise made it exactly to the recipe.  Loved the cumin in this.  It blended beautifully with the other ingredients.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
869184,232078,9/7/2011,4,"This soup was a bit disappointing for me; I felt the flaovurs fell flat. I halved the recipe but ended up having to add the full amount of broth because there were not much moisture left when the veggies were done and the veggies were cooked with the lid on. So not really sure what happened, perhaps this is one of the recipes that shouldn't be cut back. I served it with sour cream and cilantro which helped a bit."
81611,232078,11/1/2011,3,"The kids had a hard time with something new. I thought the cilantro took it to near-perfection. Then again, I could eat cilantro in everything but brownies."
514129,232079,6/8/2007,4,I really liked this a lot. It is nice and fresh and was fast to make. Portions were a bit small...
481092,232080,7/25/2007,4,"Good fish.  We grilled the fish.  I was a little confused with the instructions to put in jar and shake.  My sauce was quite thick, so not really shakable.  Served with recipe #238342.  Thanks for posting."
1201494,232082,3/13/2009,0,"I love tabouleh but am now eating gluten free.  This is just as good as the original.  It was so good I ate 5 servings all by myself.  I didn't have any fresh mint, rocket or sumac so just left those out."
602448,232082,6/9/2010,5,"I made this just as written thanks to my nearby Persian store with Sumac, a salad container full of rocket and some fresh herbs from our garden.  I made this just as written except extra Sumac as I noticed salt was omitted.  It didn't need the salt.  I also cut back a bit on the olive oil.  Great recipe!  I used about a cup of arugala unpacked."
469903,232082,6/18/2010,5,"Oh boy was this good! Much better than the traditional bulgar imo. When I first looked at the time to make this I was thinking, nah I can get it done sooner... which is true, but the quinoa takes forever to cool - so it really does take about an hour before its ready to eat even though much of the time is waiting. Instead of mixing the rocket into the mix, we placed in underneath to kind of make a bed of rocket. Then squeezed fresh lemon juice all over the top - looking forward to leftovers today! DH also really liked this one and helped himself to way too much. Made for ZWT6."
593927,232082,8/26/2010,5,This is a good one but not my favorite on the site. I used all the ingredients including freshly squeezed lemon juice and an unrefined olive oil.
1698041,232082,2/7/2012,5,awesome
222478,232083,2/3/2008,5,These were fantastic! First time I've tried pecorino cheese and really glad I bought some because it suits this recipe really well and my taste in general so it was a good new discovery in the cheese world. The herbs work together really well with the eggs and cheese and it was quick to put together and thoroughly enjoyed.
199792,232083,5/29/2009,5,"This is a lovely omelette. I love omelettes and I love asparagus so how could I go wrong. Well, I didn't have fresh herbs so made do with dried which worked out fine. There was no way that I was going to be able to flip this omelette so I just cooked it as I usually would. It seems I left it on a little long as it got quite brown on the bottom but it tasted great and was still soft. I used fresh grated parmesan and loved it. I haven't found pecorino but will keep my eyes open. Thanks for sharing your recipe. Made for ZWT5 Hell's Kitchen Angels."
724631,232083,5/30/2009,5,"Delightful, easy, still had good egg-y taste.  We asparagus and omelette lovers relished these.  I even made a special trip to a grocer this a.m. to get fresh fresh sage and fresh thyme, and I am so glad I did.  I was confused at first by ""1 bunch"" of sage, but decided you meant one twig's worth, not my entire purchase.  I used an 8-inch nonstick pan and a 1/4 cup measure to fill the pan; I think it's easier to flip a smaller crepe-style omelette.  Hollandaise is nice, but hard to justify on Weight Watchers :lol: .  Thank you for sharing this recipe, I'll use this again and again, and sometime I'll try it with dried herbs to see if that is acceptable after experiencing the real deal (""we're worth it"").  Made as ""Slice of Lime Babe"" of the Bodacious Brickhouse Babes for ZWT5's French Omelette Challenge."
226863,232083,5/31/2009,5,"This is a very nice omelette.  I made it for breakfast for all the family I have in for DS's graduation.  After watching French Tart's tutorial, I substituted water for the milk.  I used walnut oil instead of olive oil because I thought the nutty taste would complement the asparagus.  I used fromage blanc, freshly cracked black pepper, and finished it off with fleur de sel. Made for ZWT Saucy Senoritas."
197023,232083,6/1/2009,5,"We greatly enjoyed these flavoursome omelette wraps (I halved the recipe for just two of us) with Recipe #124648 and Recipe #215647.  My only changes were to use 2 cloves of minced garlic to the half quantity made, low-fat milk and to add some rosemary to the sage and thyme.  Just love garlic and herbs!  YUMMY!  I made these for Ali Baba's Babes for ZWT 5.  Thanks for a wonderfully delicious recipe, **Jubes**.  Made for Ali Baba's Babes for ZWT 5."
386585,232083,6/2/2009,5,"Well, I love asparagus, and this is a delightful, new way to prepare it.  I halved the recipe and used chives and dill instead of the sage and thyme (my preference).  The result was wonderful, and I will be enjoying this again.  Made for the ZWT5 Omelette Challenge by a Groovy GastroGnome.  (Oh...I also did use hollandaise, which was a nice touch.)"
69904,232083,6/5/2009,5,"This was yummy!  I made this for myself for breakfast today and was pleased that I chose this recipe.  The boys had already eaten and were disappointed when they started smelling mommy's breakfast cooking.  =)  I used 1% milk and dill instead of sage but other than that followed the directions.  A treat for me this was!  Thanks!  Made for the Genies of Gourmet, Zwt 5 Omelette Challenge!"
5060,232083,4/2/2010,5,"wow, loved these omelette wraps, heavenly and full of flavour!  I had to use dried herbs, and will look forward to  using fresh next time. I used sharp cheddar for the cheese and 2% milk.  Had a little trouble turning the crepes to cook the other side, so I poped them under the broiler for a minute to finish them up.  Bet they would make great appetizers, I sure enjoyed them for my supper tonight.  Thanks for posting!!"
770900,232083,4/12/2011,5,This is a fantastic recipe.  Very easy and quick to make.  It is full of various flavors in each bite.  I used thyme and rosemary as the rosemary complements the Asparagus so well.  Thanks.
1822338,232083,4/14/2011,0,"Sounds very good.  I would make with greek avgolemono sauce- a lower fat alternative to hollandaise,  I have used this sauce as a substitute for hollandaise many times, can add more or less lemon to taste and then just use leftover asparagus water or water and extra salt to taste to  thin the sauce as needed.  The flavour of butter sauce without as much butter!"
146741,232083,4/16/2011,5,This was surprisingly good! I added avocado and tomatoes in the wrap and we loved them for breakfast. Used cheddar cheese.
67026,92490,1/1/2008,4,"Super easy!  Tasty, too!  Thanks so much, happy new year!"
650373,232083,4/21/2011,5,"Like this!  Half a recipe is a great way to use a small spring harvest of asparagus. I  think next time I will use more cheese and less milk, at my husband's request. We enjoyed it as part of a fulfilling breakfast before the kids got up."
1428422,232083,4/30/2011,5,"I decided to try this for breakfast this morning,I didn't have the fresh herbs, so I used dried - I also used egg beaters to save calories - it was amazing!  a real keeper and nice breakfast/brunch to serve company.  It would be great with a side of fresh fruit or salad"
274913,232083,6/27/2011,5,"fantastic recipe! super easy and just delicious. i steam the asparagus while i make the crepes. i use soy milk (and dried herbs, if necessary) and they turn out just wonderful. we have this for dinner with a nice big salad, and it makes a lovely, light, but satisfying dinner. thanks for sharing!"
498271,232083,7/18/2011,5,"This is a delightful recipe!  Made just as directed except used dried herbs instead of fresh.  The egg wraps were so flavorful, great with the asparagus but I think also they would be great with many other veggies (broccoli, mushrooms, roasted tomatoes.....).  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!"
286566,232083,9/16/2011,5,"Just loved all the flavours from the herbs and the cheese and then that crispy asparagus so lovely and fresh.  I did microwave my asparagus though so it made for a quick and easy breakfast.  Thank you **Jubes**, made for Make My Recipe - Edition 15."
2177426,232083,5/14/2016,5,Simple and elegant! Thank you
284897,232085,2/10/2008,5,"Such a rich and creamy Butter Jubes. I followed this recipe exactly except for I did most of mine in the microwave on a very low setting, and it turned out brilliantly. It tasted as fantastic as it looked. DH & DD absolutley loved it! This butter would make a great filling for a sponge cake, but I dont think there will be any left!
I got 2 jars from this recipe, so I will be making more very soon.
Thanks **Jubes** a great recipe find.
Thanks for sharing."
1240164,232085,1/25/2010,5,"This is fantastic!  Of course, I love both of these flavors.  We love it served on English Muffins or pancakes even."
60124,232085,6/19/2010,5,"excellent recipe. I used a cup of fresh passionfruit, and a cup of lemon juice. 
This came out fairly tart, but I like it like that :)
I got 4 small jars, only one left .......made for Aussie swap june 2010"
2724038,232087,3/6/2013,4,Made this recipe for the hubby and he (
244913,232086,9/23/2007,3,i made it with half white and half whole wheat flour. wasnt as sweet of a muffin as i like a chocolate chip muffin to be. but otherwise it was good
705251,232086,7/18/2008,3,These are a very dense muffin and not overly sweet which is nice for use as a breakfast treat.  I think next time I will use half white and half wheat to see if that helps with the density of the muffin since this ended up a bit on the dry side or maybe add a bit more milk.  Overall I love the flavor of the wheat with the chocolate chips and it tasted great warmed up and served with my morning coffee.  Tagged in Everyday is a Holiday game.  Thanks Redsie!
136997,232088,6/17/2009,5,"Interesting cookie. Very crisp, which I don't mind. I was only able to use 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips and I assumed the directions meant 6 cups of whole potato chips before crushing. I used Ms Vickie's, which are my favorite. :)"
831774,232088,5/15/2010,5,"These cookies intrigue me. First of all i added about 8 ounces of crushed ruffle chips.. and 4 ounces semi sweet choc chips.  When i first tasted the dough, i didnt think i liked the nutmeg. I used a cookie scoop and baked them without switching for 12 minutes (perfect) and as said they turn out very thin and flat. But this turned out to make them crisp on the outside and soft and REALLY good in the middle. And after they were baked i found that i do like the nutmeg, although i would like to try it without out. It gives them almost a bit of a toffee hint in them ? however weird this was this recipe turned out to be VERY goood !"
2198343,232088,12/3/2014,4,Interesting recipe. We made the mistake of making these way too big. We&#039;ll know to scoop less batter next time!  We also used less chocolate chips that the recipe called for.  We thought they were too many.
4470,232089,7/29/2007,5,"I looked at this recipe and hesitated I thought ""I wonder"" well wonder no more it is delightful! Unfortunately I didn't have any almonds and did not use any creme fraiche. It was still wonderful, refreshing taste. The kitchen had the love aroma of cinnamon & apple. This is a definate make again omelet
Thanks NurseDi for another lovely recipe"
630318,232089,2/26/2008,0,"Delicious!  My older brother used to make apple-cinnamon omelets for the family, and this recipe was pure nostalgic bliss!  I left out the raisins, almonds, and cream fraiche (to be more like my brother used to make), but I'll use that next time.  I also used 2 whole eggs and an equal amount of egg whites; since I used a large apple, the proportions were perfect, and the final product made 2 good size servings.  Thanks for an amazing recipe!"
54678,232092,3/12/2008,5,I had to use up some ripe tomatoes fast and this was a great alternative to just chopping them up. I used a few on top of grilled chicken and the rest went into a soup.
284897,232092,3/13/2008,5,"Oh my gosh! So many things you could do with these. So very easy and such great flavour. 
The tomatoes have such a concentrated and wonderful taste when made this way.
My tomatoes were fresh and ripe from the garden, so I am not sure if this gave a more concentrated flavour, but the taste is just like semi sun dried tomatoes. I made as per recipe although I sprinkled a small amount of sugar over them before baking. I didnt use the remaining vinegar because I used these straight away on toast. I also made them again today............
I adore them, and will be making this recipe fully using the remaining vinegar and use them cold on sandwhiches and such.
Great recipe ratherbeswimmin this recipe is now etched on my brain permanently, so I will be able to make it anytime for a quick snack!
Thanks for a absolutely wonderful recipe."
587675,232092,8/4/2010,5,"I actually made this recipe to look for a way to get rid of some of the excessive moisture in tomatoes  that I was using in tomato pie - The first time I used fresh tomatoes and some tarragon vinegar - they were fantastic, could not stop eating them, almost did not have enough for the pie.  The second time I used some rather sad roma tomatoes from the grocery store - I tasted one after the 30 minutes and decied to flip them and roast for another 30 - wow they were so very good - I used this method for my own roasted-tomato-pie-434080 but will be using a lot for all sort of recipes."
55729,33283,12/2/2002,2,"This was just too wierd. The texture of the noodles in chicken noodle soup definitely leaves something to be desired. There was also not enough liquid, so the chops stuck to the pan."
13483,33283,4/8/2003,4,I thought these were just fine. I used a chicken noodle O (rather than spaghetti type) and it worked like a charm.  I did have to add a bit of extra water though.  Great flavour.  
219223,91908,5/30/2005,1,"When fried, the pancakes stuck to both the frying pan and the skillet I tried.  I used excessive grease, but to no avail.  They were impossible to flip and ended up as balls of hot gooey dough that my puppy loved."

759481,163805,7/25/2009,5,i had never made tater tot casserole till i found this recipe its just like what my mom used to make for us!!! me and my husband loved it.
12038,163805,9/22/2009,0,"Thanks for posting this!  I had this recipe a long time ago, and lost it.  I specifically like that you don't have to brown the beef.  My kids and hubby will be happy tonight when I serve this long lost favorite!"
1359150,163805,11/17/2009,4,We made this for dinner tonight and it was very good! We used frozen corn for the veggie though :)
293410,178244,5/16/2007,4,Yumm. I used Charlotte J's cajun spice mix. Great with roasted potatoes. Thanks!
58104,178244,5/20/2007,4,"I used 2 carrots and a couple baby carrots because that is what I had. Skipped the salt since I used the soy, and skiped the pepper because i used Recipe #92066 which had enough kick. Didn`t use the butter using 1 tablespoon olive oil, it was good. Just loved it thanks."
1052873,178244,4/20/2014,5,"Very easy and yummy. Matchstick carrots were on sale so I used those and my bell pepper was 1/4 of each red, yellow, and orange that I had leftover from another recipe. I used Tony Chachere&#039;s More Spice. Made for PAC 14."
67656,211781,3/6/2007,4,"This was such a simple side and really added a nice bit of flavor to my couscous.  The surprise was that it was the combination of the shallots and corn that really made the dish and gave this a rounded and slightly sweet flavor.  I ended up tossing in some fresh basil ribbons in place of the cayenne and that took this to a new level as the herb elevated the sweetness of he fresh corn. My one commment was that at the end of the cooking time, my couscous was still rather hard as there was not enough liquid.  I ended up bringing another 1/2 cup of broth to a boil in a separate pot,  adding it to the couscous and letting it seep an additional 3 minutes. Thanks."
89831,211781,3/11/2007,5,"Cheesehead we enjoyed this tonight I used yellow onion, added in some fresh garlic and used homemade turkey broth that I keep in my freezer, thanks for sharing...Kitten:)"
179133,211781,3/29/2007,5,"This was very good! A little on the plain side flavor-wise, but paired brilliantly with recipe #200296 (which was a little on the spicier side). I had about 1/2 cup corn and just 2/3 cup couscous I needed to use, but after reading the couscous package directions (which called for 1 cup liquid for that amount of couscous) I used what I had and left all the other ingredient amounts the same. I'm a recent convert to couscous (never cared for it much in the past) and I liked the sweetness that the corn & shallot added. Thanks so much for the recipe!"
165933,211781,4/2/2007,5,"This was my first time making couscous.  I had more than the 1/3 cup of corn, had to use up the rest of the bag.  It turned out fantastic.  I'm a big couscous fan now!  The cayenne is a must!  I also added some garlic, I love garlic. I had to send this one to my son in college as they are trying couscous also.  Thanks for a great recipe."
54697,211781,4/2/2007,3,"As written, a little bland for our taste, but easily salvagable with the addition of a little more cayenne and some fresh herbs."
218859,211781,7/10/2007,4,The family enjoyed this dish - plenty of flavour.  We served it with the Oven Fried Garlic chicken (recipe 83561) and this was a good match.
383346,211781,5/12/2008,5,So simple and delicious.  We all liked it.  We didn't have shallot so we skipped the step 2.  We used a can of corn and it was still good but next time I'll try with frozen corn.  Thanks Wi Cheesehead.  Made for Zaar Star Game.
708494,214194,4/16/2009,5,I love soup and I love beans I quadrupled to make a bigger batch and enjoyed it very much.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Spring PAC 2009
345780,233959,5/23/2009,5,nice combo - was quick+tasty
356062,257985,10/23/2007,5,I made these yesterday and scaled it down to serve two just fine. The only problem I had was the cheese didnt melt has nicely as full fat cheese versions do. Other than that a tasty recipe. Great recipe that is lite but sure doesnt taste like it!
166642,257985,3/1/2008,5,"I love that this is light and it doesn't taste like it! My family did not even notice that it was light, either, so that is an added bonus. This is just wonderful. I highly recommend it and will be making it again. Thanks for sharing."
133174,257985,7/17/2008,5,"This recipe got a thumbs up from my friends grandchildren ages 3 and 1.  I used your recipe and my technique and had mac and cheese in less than half an hour.  While the macaroni was cooking the cheese sauce was made in the Vita-Mix.  After mixing in the cheese sauce and sprinkling the remaining cheese over the dish, it was placed in the oven for about 10 to 15 minutes."
226863,257985,12/3/2008,5,"I am not a mac and cheese lover, but DS is, and he loved this.  He gave it 5+ stars.  Thanks for posting!  Made this for Everyday is a Holiday tag."
168462,257985,4/9/2009,5,"I loved this recipe, but only used cheddar not the other cheeses. I used the total amount of cheese called for, but just used cheddar. Thanks for he recipe."
213139,257985,5/29/2009,5,"Made for Zaar Stars.  We love mac & cheese, especially the baked kind, but I rarely make it because it is so loaded with fat - but this isn't and it tastes just like the full fat kind.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for posting this MsSally!"
236470,257985,6/26/2010,5,Very  simple to  make and  was  very  tasty--Will  make  again  for sure
170271,257985,10/5/2010,4,I will make this again.  It came together nicely and the family approved. Thank you for posting.
189013,123030,8/4/2006,5,tastes absolutely perfect!  I could eat a whole one by myself!  it's also fun because you get to play with your food!
1283421,257985,3/18/2011,5,"MMMMmmm... yum.  I was making this for the kids at our St. Patrick's Day Party (it's the ""pot of gold"") and had a hard time keeping my fork out of it (and that was before it baked!).  I used an entire bag of medium shells instead of the elbows (for some reason my four year old doesn't ""do"" mac and cheese elbows), and the ratio was perfect.  I sprinkled only about 1/2 cup mozzarella on top of the mac and cheese before baking too (because the four year old also has a thing against shredded yellow cheese?!?!) and it was perfect for us. Thanks for sharing."
37449,261175,11/11/2007,5,Yummy side dish that my DH and I enjoyed!Made for Photo Tag. Thanks loof!
337963,261175,1/9/2008,4,"Loved it, loved it, loved it!  I made it in my little crockpot with a timer set to start late afternoon, but the timer didn't work, so I ended up microwaving it instead and it still turned out perfectly.  This is a dish that I will definitely be making again and again.  If you are considering making this dish, please see my rating system as I rate tougher than most.  Thanks for posting a keeper Loof!"
424680,261175,2/11/2008,5,"This recipe certainly does bring back memories of my grandma & mom! I like corn so included a can of whole kernel corn & was very pleased with the results! Certainly a recipe I'll keep on hand! [Tagged, made & reviewed for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders tag game]"
361931,261175,12/15/2008,4,This was very tasty!  I liked the buttery flavor from the addition of the crackers.  Thanks for sharing!
315565,261175,6/17/2009,4,"Really tasty side, I also added a chopped tomato and a can of corn kernels. This is a great versatile side dish."
271119,272390,1/12/2008,5,"This is such a great recipe.  My Mother-in-Law wants this every Christmas.  Only changes I made (from my Grandmother's recipe) for sweet potatoes, 1/3 cup butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Topping, 1/3 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup self-rising flour and 1 cup pecans.  It is so good!  Thank you."
967525,272390,11/29/2008,5,I usually don't like sweet potato casserole.  This was delicious!
355694,272390,4/23/2010,5,I really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to prepare and my favorite part was the topping. Thanks for sharing.
723491,277974,5/9/2008,5,"These were really yummy cookies that my kids gobbled up when they came to visit!  I made them with pecans, as they are my favorite.  Wouldn't change anything in this recipe.  The 2 1/2 c. flour worked for me.  Thanks Girly!"
86318,315997,6/10/2012,5,"This makes very good, smooth ice cream. I did not use the brand of yogurt mentioned, but did use a full-fat plain European style yogurt. It seemed fine. I used fresh lime juice (not certain if they were key limes or not - round limes from Mexico), and added the zest of one lime. I think the added zest is necessary. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe with us."
768039,319358,8/19/2008,5,"I admit, I was very sceptical about this. Daughter #2 was very interested, though, so I gave it a try. We added gummy worms to the top, and used neufchatel instead of full fat cream cheese. She and also daughter#3 were very happy with the results. Thanks for this one, Mrs Carp!"
900727,319358,12/8/2008,5,"Love this version! so much better and simple to make then the other ""dirt cake"" recipes on the site! The Cool-Whip, cream cheese and condensed milk mixture that none other has is just SOOO GOOD!"
407088,319358,8/3/2009,5,"I just got done putting this together and wow, it was so much simpler than the other dirt cake recipes! Mom and I typically make two for Thanksgiving and 2 for Christmas, but we make the type that uses butter and powdered sugar. I'll be using this one for now on! I made 3 little sundae cups of it for my parents and my son and they raved! Will take the rest of it to a going away party for my dirt cake adoring cousins tomorrow. I am planning on spelling out ""Utah or Bust"" with gummy worms for them! Thanks for the simple, delicious recipe!

UPDATE:  I didn't even get around to putting the gummy words on it, but took it tonight to the party and it was the only dessert that was completely eaten.  Next time, I'll have to make 2!  :)"
1517744,319358,10/23/2012,5,Great dirt cake recipe!  Super easy and a big hit with kids and kids-at-heart.
2000117867,319358,4/5/2015,3,4cups of milk made this way too runny. Would have set up better with 2 1/2-3 cups and it would have been perfect. Trust me the 4cups makes it way too runny. Will be making it again but using less milk.
2000359038,319358,7/24/2015,0,I wish this clarified the condensed milk as sweetened condensed milk or evaporated milk! I&#039;m not sure which to use!
467721,123030,4/21/2007,5,yummy!
391666,319358,8/27/2015,5,"I only had an 8oz tub of cool whip and a 14 oz package of cookies, and both sizes were absolutely fine. Using sweetened condensed milk was a time-saving plus over  the recipes that call for powdered sugar and butter. I softened the cream cheese and beat it with the sweetened condensed milk, added the pudding and then folded in the cool whip. The result was a tasty fluffy chocolate mixture.  Everybody loved the cake. Thanks for sharing!"
902736,337696,2/5/2009,4,"This was a nice lil salad, I liked it cold but DH liked his warm... I will make again"
494867,337696,10/16/2011,5,So good!  This is a really tasty salad! I accidently made it with peas because the bag of frozen edamame that I know I had in the freezer somehow disappeared.  But peas turned out to be an excellent sub.  I loved the variety of textures and the rice vinegar added a lovely flash of tangy zip. I think this salad is going on the Thanksgiving table this year!
277925,350162,1/19/2009,3,"good basic chili recipe and not to spicy for kids. I made as instructed but used 6 teaspoons od chili powder. The garbonzo beans add a great texture to the dish. If I don't make this again, I will add the Gaarbonzos to my regular chili"
226863,396482,6/1/2013,5,Really good tuna salad.  Love the capers!  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Bargain Basement Tag game!
1806667,452580,4/14/2011,5,very good. the oats gave it an unexpected texture and flavor. I never would have thought of that. thanks for posting. looking forward to seeing what else you will be posting in the future.
80778,27654,2/14/2005,5,"This sounded intriguing, so I just had to try it.  And I'm glad I did  I did make a couple of adjustments, though.  I'm trying to eat lower fat and lower sodium foods, so I substituted ground turkey breast for the beef and used lower sodium tomato juice rather than V-8 juice and used olive oil rather than vegetable oil.  BF wasn't too sure about this when he saw me put the applesauce in but, in the end, he gave it a high rating.  It was good using the turkey, so I can imagine how good it would be using beef.  The liquid cooked down quite a bit when I baked it.  I'm not sure if the turkey absorbed some if it -- that's possible.  We both felt it could have used more of the sauce, so next time I will make another batch of the sauce and just let it simmer on the stove so we can put more sauce over the meatballs.  All in all, we really enjoyed this, and we'll definitely be making this one again -- and I'll be sure to try it with the beef, too!  Thank you for sharing a recipe from your childhood!   "
229619,27654,8/31/2005,5,This was so good.  My whole family enjoyed it.  I waited until after dinner to tell them it had applesauce in it. My kids looked at me kinda funny then!  I even made sandwiches with the leftovers for my husband and me to take to work the next day.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again!
39835,49461,7/12/2003,5,Excellent! My family comments on these chimichangas was these were the best  we ever had. A winning recipe as far as we are concerned and no one missed the meat! I did have a real lot of mixture left over -- no problem we are refrigerating the mixture and having them again later this week. Leftovers that no one is complaining about -- a keeper recipe for us. Thanks Julesong for posting this recipe that we will be having often.
10033,49461,12/30/2003,5,"This was absolutely terrific!! Everyone should try this! I'm freezing the rest--between us, we only ate 3 chimichangas, so there are 8 left. I didn't use the black soy beans--I kind of did this at the last minute and didn't have time to go to lots of different grocery stores. Terrific recipe, served with homemade salsa and guac. Also used fat free sour cream. Thanks for a keeper!! "
50151,49461,1/6/2004,4,"Really nice recipe.  I made it as stated except I couldn't find any black soybeans so I just used two cans of black beans, which I rinsed before using.  Next time i make this I will either freeze half the mixture or just halve the recipe as it makes a lot!  But other than it making a lot it was a good recipe.  Thanks, I'll definately be making this again as it was easy and tasty!!"
72424,49461,4/2/2004,5,Just terrific. I didn't have time to look around for black soy beans so I used 2 cans regular black beans. Well seasoned and it does make a lot but my family was happy to eat the left-overs the next day. Very nice recipe. Thanks.
66549,49461,4/8/2004,5,Fabulous. We are having these for the 3rd night in a row.  I put ground beef in half of the mixture for my DH.  This makes and ton. I froze the filling into individual servings and it thaws great.  Thanks for a recipe that will be made often.
37779,49461,3/30/2005,5,"I love vegetarian cuisine and this was excellent. I also couldn't find black soy beans so just used two cans of black beans that I rinsed and drained. This was very well seasoned, hearty, and filling. The left-overs freeze and reheat well. Thanks for posting this. This would be just fine for entertaining your veggie-head friends or non-veggies, too."
194777,49461,11/1/2005,5,"This recipe was de-lish!  Everyone loved them (and my family doesn't even like beans!)  Could only find white soybeans, but they worked just great.  Served them with extra sour cream, salsa, and cheddar.  Will definitely be making these again and again!"
299608,49461,10/5/2006,5,I was so excited to find black soy beans in my health food store because my partner is allergic to regular black/pinto beans.  So i made this dish with refried black soy beans as well as added the whole soy beans.  I ran out of cumin so i ended up using some cajun seasoning and chili powder...very tasty.  really great recipe.
338539,49461,3/11/2007,4,"My whole family enjoyed this recipe!    I had to use white soybeans as they didn't have black at our grocery store, but otherwise made it pretty much just as described.  I used the mushrooms, but I didn't think they added much -- you couldn't really taste them.  My mushroom hater found and picked them out though, so I may leave them out next time.  I filled 10 large tortillas to bursting, and still had a little filling left, so make sure to have enough tortillas on hand! 

I will say that the prep took me a lot longer than 10 minutes though (more like 30 to mix and assemble everything), and people should remember to factor in pre-cooking the rice if they don't have cooked rice on hand."
440527,49461,3/26/2007,5,I cant believe how good these were. I will be making these again. even my kids liked them.
478260,49461,5/3/2007,5,This was really good. I made this last December. I froze half of what the recipe made. Re-heated very well for a quick lunch or dinner. Will definately make this again.
399374,49461,5/12/2007,5,"This made way more than the recipe stated, they kept well and were delicious as leftovers. I even had meat eating co workers asking for the recipe. Very filling and easy to make."
129700,49461,7/23/2007,5,"I had some leftover cooked brown/wild rice pilaf that gave it a nutty & chewier texture.  Also added small dice zucchini and pepper jack cheese.  These are delicious, versatile and not fried!"
170363,49461,12/26/2007,4,This recipe is a healthy alternative as it is not fried. They were very well recieved by my family one of whom is vegetarian. The left hours were frozen to be used as lunch on the go later in the week. These will become part of my stand by to feed the teens who come to our home!
650938,49461,1/5/2008,5,Loved these!  We have just started eating mostly vegetarian and my whole family loved them.  no one missed the meat at all.  I left out the cumin and chili powder because of my kids but I still think it had tons of flavor.  I also used whole wheat flour tortillas and garnished with fresh pico de gallo and guacamole.  Had so much that I froze half the mixture for easy dinner next week.  Thanks!!!
412847,49461,2/22/2008,5,"My husband and I made these for a Valentine's dinner this year and they were fabulous!  We used canned mushrooms, basmati rice and regular soybeans.  So delicious - we will definitely make these again."
115065,49461,3/25/2008,5,"I made these for the Freezer Tag game in the Budget/OAMC forum.  They are excellent!!  I made one pan to eat immediately, and froze the rest.  For some, I wrapped the filling into the tortilla.  For others, I froze just the filling, in ""logs"" about the shape and size I needed for one tortilla.  In both cases, I put them on a baking sheet and into the freezer until they were solid.  Then I wrapped each one in waxed paper and stored in a freezer bag.  To use, I thawed individual portions for a few minutes in the microwave, then toasted them in the toaster oven till crispy.  I used fresh tortillas for the ""logs"" and thawed the filling before wrapping. I used whole wheat tortillas, and topped with sour cream, and if you like, a healthy bit of chopped cilantro. Yum!!!"
192581,49461,12/5/2008,5,"I've been wanting to make this for a while, then lost the recipe, and recently found it!  Before I tell you how great they are, I omitted the mushrooms (don't eat them) and avocado (too much fat, albeit good fat), and halved this to the best of my ability.  I omitted the black soy beans as the store didn't carry them.  I also subbed low-fat Greek yogurt for sour cream.  Used the whole can of chiles. Finally, these were AMAZINGLY good!  I had these both warm and cold and they were every bit as good cold.  If you don't have to cook the rice first it is a really quick meal.  My only minor recommendation would be if you want them a bit crispier, add 5 minutes to cooking time.  Will definitely be making these again (even after I use the leftovers sitting in the freezer).  Thanks so much Julesong!"
820197,49461,4/3/2009,5,"These were absolutely FANTASTIC!! I'm always on the look out for vegetarian dishes during Lent, as my family gets sick of always eating quesadillas and tostadas. EVERYONE loved these!! There was tons of filling to make a lot of chimis, but those chimis didn't have a fighting chance...they were gone! I will definitly be making these again, even after Lent. Thanks so much Julesong!"
768828,49461,5/1/2009,5,"These were very good.  I used medium size tortillas and got 32.  I fixed six for lunch and froze the rest after I made them up.  I'm sure they will be just as good thawed and baked later, if not even better.  My DH liked them also - don't think he even noticed there was no meat.  Thanks for a great receipe."
1261253,49461,6/18/2009,5,"This is very good and so easy to make. It makes a lot, but the leftovers are great!"
1302255,49461,6/21/2009,5,"Fabulous! 

We make these regularly now. My husband loves them & will very happily eat the filling from a bowl if we run out of tortillas."
353379,49461,10/6/2009,4,"Yum!  We used one can of black beans and one can of refried beans and that was plenty.  If you can't find the black soybeans, don't worry about it because it will be good anyway.  We left out the avocado and sour cream and cut back on the cheese.  We had a lot of extra filling that we plan to eat as nachos!"
925054,49461,12/6/2009,5,"These really were great.  Quick to make, tasted wonderful, PLUS they freeze very well.  After baking all 10, my family only ate 6 of them, so I froze the other 4.  I defrosted later and re-heated in the microwave for 2 minutes and they were delish!  Thanks for sharing."
1167743,49461,12/10/2009,5,"I've made this recipe a couple of times now, and I just love it!  The first time I made these, I used the mushrooms but realized while eating them that I couldn't really taste them, so I don't use them anymore.  I think they do make a great low-calorie filler if people want to use them though.  I follow everything else as directed except I use pinto beans in place of the black soybeans, because my grocery store doesn't sell those.  I especially love these, because I make them for dinner for my husband and I, and I still have enough left over to eat for lunch for a week!  Thank you for a great, healthy recipe!"
1269015,49461,5/24/2010,5,"Good stuff! They freeze really well too, which is great for a one-person chef like me. Will be making again!"
628127,49461,6/27/2010,5,These were great! I made half with leftover pork and half as written.  Great for a party b/c they did make a ton!
772128,49461,7/2/2010,5,"I hosted a luncheon this weekend, and served baked ham with a cranberry glaze, lemon dill chicken over rice, baked ziti, ect. and this recipe for the chimichangas. Much to my surprise this was the biggest hit! I had so many rave reviews and had to print up copies of the recipe for several of my guests. To be honest I'm a meat kinda guy and I was blown away by them too. As with other reviews I couldn't find the soybeans so I doubled up on drained and rinsed black beans I didn't use the mushrooms or the avocado. I used 8"" torts to make them more buffet friendly with about 1/4 cup of filling in each. The recipe made about 18 chimichangas."
274585,49461,8/17/2010,5,"Delicious! I cut the recipe roughly in half and made 6 chimichangas. I used 1 15 oz can black beans and 1 15 oz can refried beans and no rice. Very easy, which makes it even more tasty"
227652,49461,9/1/2010,5,"I almost hate to review this recipe because I had to work with what I had, since I'm the sole vegetarian in the family & couldn't have a huge amt of leftovers! I used leftover black beans from recipe#52177, brown rice & mushrooms; added more cumin & chili powder for spice. I didn't use the refried beans; black beans were enough for me. I thought the recipe was amazing! However, the filling was too hot (temperature-wise) so made it hard to bite through; next time I may try 350 degrees! I loved the cheese on top. Served with fat free sour cream. Thank you!"
279952,49461,12/29/2010,5,These were really good.  I used a pack of veggie ground round to replace the refried beans and black soybeans.  Also left out the avocado.  My 9 year old loved it too.  Served with salsa and yogurt.
1935392,49461,6/25/2011,5,"My husband who is an avid meat eater just confessed that this recipe is by far the best chimichanga he has EVER had anywhere!!! That's quite the compliment!! I halved the recipe thinking to make 4 for our 2 person household, however the filling easily made 6 very large chimichanga's. I also used fat free refried beans, fat free sour cream and part skim cheddar cheese. Be sure to rinse your black and soybeans, this is not stated in the recipe but is a must, even if you use unsalted beans(which I also did)."
1870301,49461,11/22/2012,4,Loved these! I omitted the soy beans and used a vegan cheese sauce.
198754,87861,2/26/2005,5,"I love Greek food, but I had never made it at home, so I went on a search for good, well written recipes that were thorough.  This one definitely measured up.  

Lamb is strong tasting, but this recipe has a lot of ""zingy"" ingredients that seem to tame the lamb and make it incredibly flavorful. I used a little extra lemon, so I added breadcrumbs from one slice of bread to help bind the meat mixture.
 
I also blended the ground lamb with all the ingredients in a food processor before putting it on the skewers.  It gave it a more ""pressed"" texture like gyros look on spits in Greek restaurants. 

Since you can't sample raw meat to make sure you've gotten enough salt and spices; I sautéed a small meatball to taste before grilling.  

I prepared the suggested tzatziki sauce (80959) which was thick and yummy, and also made baked Greek (garlic) lemon potatoes (451) which were fantastic!  I also highly recommend using recipe (59898) for Greek-style salad dressing.  It has traditional ingredients, plus feta and buttermilk.  My kitchen was a complete mess, but the entire meal was delicious!

62562,87861,3/29/2008,4,"The flavors in this dish are exquisite! We loved it 5 stars for flavor and enjoyment! Even my 2 & 4yo grandsons devoured them. I only gave 4 stars because I had to add about a cup of breadcrumbs for binder to get them to hold together well enough to grill. And even then they barely hung on until they were cooked enough not to fall through the grill. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written. 
Next time I make these (and there will be a next time) I will add the bread crumbs and just form elongated patties. The meat didn't want to stay on the skewers anyway, it was just too soft of a mixture.
We used all the suggested toppings and I highly recommenmd the za'atar. Thanks Lorie for a very delicious meal!!!"
68884,123030,3/20/2006,5,"Delicious!!! I loved this and served it to guests who ate seconds. I liked the fact that I didn't have to roll out the cookie dough, though I did slighly flatten each cookie slice before I overlapped it on the pan. I used vanilla in the cream cheese but think any flavoring would be really tasty. I used bananas, blueberries, strawberries, kiwi & mandarin oranges. I used two thick coats of the glaze and still had plenty left - I think 1/4 cup preserves (I used peach) and 1/2 Tbsp water would be plenty. This is impressive & so good - I'll make again for sure."
226242,123030,1/7/2009,5,"Quick, simple, and oh soooo delicious!  I've made this several times over the past 6 months - couldn't believe I hadn't already reviewed it.  Better late than never, right?  MAKE THIS!  =)"
647138,123030,2/27/2010,5,Love this!  It's very easy to make and everyone always eats it up.  The only sad part is I never get any leftovers!
303427,123030,6/5/2011,5,"Tremendous! This was pleasing to the whole family and really fun to prepare! Once I laid out the cookie dough slices, I used my hands to pinch the seals and flatten the dough, which worked really nicely in making a gorgeous, even crust for the fruit pizza. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks a bunch!"
1621833,123030,1/26/2014,5,"I made the crust with a gluten free Cherrybrook Kitchen sugar cookie mix to accommodate dietary needs. It was such a tasty! Also, after making this for the fourth time, I just microwave about 1/3 cup of apricot preservers for 10 seconds at a time (depending on your microwave) to heat the glaze to save a few minutes and a few dishes. It works great. LOVE THIS RECIPE!"
2001742379,123030,10/6/2017,0,once I started eating this I could not stop
2002057199,123030,3/17/2018,0,YOU. AN ALSO USE APPLE JELLY AS YOUR GLAZE!
2183494,139356,2/14/2012,5,"My husband tried this as a surprise for me and now when we grill steaks we use this recipe everytime!!! It is easy, savory, melt in your mouth delicious!!!"
727055,158174,11/16/2008,4,"Loved A&W as a kid (esp. the drive in part), so just had to try this recipe. Easy and tasty change from plain hot dogs, do as Cookin-jo says, and get a good quality dog.  I didn't use the outdoor grill, but pan fried the dogs in my cast iron skillet and these were very good. Thanks for sharing!"
690623,158174,5/31/2013,5,Ahhh.  The Whistle Dog of my youth!  It used to be my favourite thing at A&amp;W.  This is a wonderful version.  I used a great quality hot dog and only 1 slice of bacon per dog.  Toasted the buns under the oven broiler and grilled the hot dogs on an indoor grill.  Thanks for sharing.  These may very well become our summertime treat!
166642,224949,5/20/2007,5,These were delicious sloppy Joes! I have never made sloppy Joes with sausage before but it really eenhanced the flavor of these! I think next time I will use a hot sausage to give them a little more kick. My family really enjoyed these!
453216,224949,2/12/2008,5,This has to be the best homemade joe recipe I've made or ever had and I have made many different recipes before. This is a keeper and one I will probably use all of the time. DH loved them also. Oh and I used the stove-top method of cooking them.
527607,385140,8/30/2009,5,"I loved this, served it with some grilled chicken.  

Made for New Zaar Tag where unreviewed recipes get reviewed :)"
65634,62199,6/12/2003,4,"Deciding on this at the last minute, I used canned green beans, drained.  Family loved it.  Thanks Jeannette.  TJ"
84247,62199,6/22/2003,5,"I thought these were great.  I didn't add quite as much garlic, but then I used the refrigerated type that is like using fresh.  I thought it would be too much.

My family liked this one too.    Even my 10 year old liked them."
58038,62199,8/1/2003,3,"This was easy to make.  However, it didn't seem to have too much flavor and it had A LOT of extra oil; so much that I had to drain the beans.  I used fresh beans from the local farmer's market and extra garlic."
22973,62199,6/12/2004,5,"Jeanette,  Thanks for this great side dish,I was afraid it would be too oily as ducky said,so I cut the oil down to 1 Tablespoon,and I used canned green beans as I had no fresh ones,but it turned out great.I thought these were very tasty.Thanks Darlene"
463845,62199,3/18/2008,3,"In my opinion, they could use more flavor. I added toasted almonds for a nice crunch, but the oil and garlic didn't add the flavor I was looking for to the beans."
485728,62199,10/14/2008,5,"These were really, really good.  I thought they were very flavorful without overpowering the taste of the beans.  Thanks very much for the recipe.  These will be made often here!"
121690,63529,1/6/2005,4,I made this exactly as written. My family and I found it very enjoyable.
1609858,63529,2/4/2014,4,"I thought this sounded really strange, but I wanted to try it for my little guy who loves bananas.  We all enjoyed it!"
1227563,94442,8/28/2012,5,"We enjoyed this recipe. I had to adjust it some due to not having all the ingredients called for. I  did not have chicken broth/stock so I used bouillon. Only had the boil in bag rice. I did have all the veggies including home made chipotle. I put the bouillon in the water with the bagged rice and microwaved 8 minutes and sauted the veggies while the rice was cooking. I emptied the rice into the skillet and just guessed at the amount of liquid to add back in, maybe a cup and a half. Simmered the water down and it was ready."
6357,64852,6/24/2003,5,"This kheer is absolutely DIVINE!Saundana(sago) kheer happens to be one of my favourite desserts. I made this at 8:45 this morning(as soon as I woke up) and it was ready by 9:15am. My kitchen smells beautiful with the aroma of this kheer wafting through it! Today my dad will be fasting all through the day(for the soul of my late grandma to rest in peace). He is permitted to have only certain foods through the day, one of which, is sabudana. He is not allowed to have almonds or raisins today and so I had to omit these from this recipe. In my opinion, raisins should really be omitted from this kheer or they could be made an optional ingredient. I used low-fat milk to make this(to make it slightly guilt-free);-)
Also, I used 6 green cardamoms(powdered in my mixer) and not just 2. The quantity of sugar in this is perfect. One important thing that I'd like to mention is that sabudana does not get soft very easily while cooking - it is pretty stubborn an ingredient! So, I soaked it in boiling hot water for 10 minutes before using it for this kheer. Another thing what I did was to keep checking if it had softened through the cooking process. I had to bring it to a boil four times and only then it was soft. Only after it was soft, I added in the sugar and then cooked it till the desired consistency. I Promise, I will make this often and my dad will be absolutely pleased to wake up from sleep and find this on the dining table! Thank YOU so much for a yummy dessert and for helping me out in the search for sabudana recipes. "
84361,64852,11/3/2003,3,"I just made this recipe. The flavor is great, however, the tapioca pearls seem to have a small hard center. Heeding the advice above, I set them in a cup with hot water and after a few minutes the one I tested squashed easily. I should have eaten it instead ;) 

I'll probably try this again later with more attention paid to softening the tapioca. Good ratios of sweetness and spice."
53425,64852,2/17/2004,3,"This was okay, but terribly bland. I should have followed Charishma's lead and added six POWDERED cardamon pods instead of the three WHOLE ones that I used - I am sure it would have been much better. I soaked the tapioca in cold water (as instructed on my package.) As noted by the other two reviewers, it still took a lot of cooking to get it soft - but that's tapioca for you. I ended up adding quite a bit more milk than called for as it was getting terribly thick while the tapioca was still hard. I will make this again, but I will want to adjust the spicing considerably. "
1114784,64852,1/23/2009,5,Exactly what I was looking for. This is really yummy. Nice balance of sweetness and spice. I washed and pre-soaked the tapioca and it cooked perfectly. I used low fat milk with no problems. Just like my mother used to make. Thanks very much !
122235,67428,3/13/2005,4,"I did a dumb thing... I made this using leftover spaghetti sauce.  The recipe suggested that as an alternative.  Well, it wasn't till I was putting it together & saw all the ground beef in the spaghetti sauce that I thought, ""Uh oh..."" This was a very nice meal & I am rating it on how I think it would've tasted with tomato sauce.  I encourage you to use tomato sauce.  I think the salmon flavor is delicate enough that it would be better with tomato sauce than with a marinara style spaghetti sauce.  But definately don't use the leftover meat sauce!"
52282,94442,7/31/2004,4,"this was a basic good recipe, though it took me 30 minutes to cook. i can see adding zucchini, black beans, tomatoes- good summer dish and easy to prepare.  i served this with chili."
118840,94442,6/9/2005,5,"Great rice!  We like spicy, so added extra chipotles, and also topped with just a sprinkle of Jack cheese.  This beats the socks off of any packaged Mexican or Spanish rice!"
54697,94442,6/30/2007,4,Very good.   I did add some black beans and it was a good addition.
463858,94442,6/16/2008,5,"I served this tonight with a spicy pork tenderloin.  We loved it, but it was just a little too spicy for my 7 yo and DH.  My FIL had 3 helpings!  I will definitely make this again but cut back on the chipotle.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that this would be wonderful with black beans.  Made and reviewed for ZWT4.  Thanks for posting Rita!"
305531,94442,6/27/2008,5,"Very good. Boy, this makes a lot for 1 cup of rice! We really enjoyed this as a side to a chicken dish. I made as directed except that I added a little cilantro along with the green onions. Thanks Rita for another keeper. Made for ZWT4."
527886,94442,7/1/2008,4,"An easy mutritious dish. I substituted quinoa for rice. I also used boiled corn kernels, but they still had a nice crunch to add interest to the dish. The chipotle add an subtle smoky flavor to the more upfront peppers and onions. I used just water, and milk instead of cream, but I think I would even use all water next time to get a distinct grainy texture, rather then creamy."
677508,94442,7/10/2008,5,Oh yeah loved the spicy kick of this dish.  We made this tonited with Recipe #255079 and they complimented each other very well.  I really didnt adjust anything in this recipe and dont think I will when I make it again.  Made for ZWT4.
213139,94442,8/3/2009,5,Made for Farmer's Market Tag 2009.  This is an excellent side dish and paired well with recipe #353537.  I only made half of the recipe and it was plenty for the three of us.  I loved the sweet taste of the corn with the spicy heat of the chipotles.  Thanks for posting this Rita!
29782,129621,11/7/2008,5,"What a wonderful potato soup recipe! I made this for the cook-a-thon for stacy. She will be missed but her recipes live on. Stacy my friend  I know your in heaven looking down on all of us with a big smile.  My hubby really loved your potato soup (so did I )  he said and I quote "" This is the stuff ""  I added some chopped onion and onion powder to the potatoes along with a Tbs. of bacon grease.  Hubby ate so much that his belly was so full, he was growling on the sofa in pain from stuffing his self. LoL   
This was so easy to come together and ready in no time at all.  Thanks for posting this delicious soup! :)   I miss ya my friend!!"
124249,159982,7/7/2007,5,"I made this for the 4th. It was so quick and easy to mix up and it was delicious.  Just like the  cherry cordial candyEven had offers from guests to take the leftovers home with them.

932192,159982,7/21/2012,4,"This was sooo good! And how much easier could an ice cream recipe be? Turned out really creamy, and perfectly sweet with the sweetened condensed milk. Thanks for posting!"
400708,159982,6/28/2015,5,"This was so good, made from cherries from our trees, and used SS chocolate chunks, so cream, and good.  Can&#039;t wait to make it again.  This is sure to be a favorite thanks so much for posting"
196038,169546,5/27/2006,4,I made this recipe this AM and we have been snacking on it since.  I made it totally by the directions given. We have enjoyed the new to us flavors and will keep it on file to make again.  Thanks for the recipe Sage.
424680,188566,4/7/2008,5,"Had reservations about this one when I saw that it included horseradish & Tabasco sauce, but I enjoy trying new things, & this definitely qualifies! I followed your recipe right on through (used crab meat), & the taste was OUTSTANDING ~ I was really impressed! Served it with crackers as well as with squares of whole wheat bread & everyone love it! [Made & reviewed for one of my adopted chefs in this Spring's PAC]"
21752,190095,12/12/2006,5,"As a proud chocoholic I must proclaim that this must be the best recipe on this entire website!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the chocolate stars, I don't know what those are and probably couldn't get them here.  Instead I added some chocolate covered cornflakes and some white chocolate covered cherries (dried cherries, not the drippy stuff).  I put this in a large jar on my desk and am now the most popular person in my office.  ;-)"
638072,190095,9/11/2008,5,Is there anything about this recipe that isnt AWESOME??!!  I just have to keep from burying my face in the bowl...
770104,190095,11/22/2008,5,"yum yum yum! my grandma used to keep a bag of chocolate chips in the freezer for out ""lady time"" and we would grab handfuls at a time. this is that idea kicked up a notch or two!
this is one good thing about a rough week! thank you"
49163,190095,7/27/2009,5,This is even better over chocolate ice cream and slathered with hot fudge.
264142,197945,12/1/2006,5,"I loved this recipe. Quick and easy and tastes great.  Next time I will cut the recipe in half, makes a lot for just one person."
102824,197945,1/29/2007,4,"This is quick, easy and taste good, but be careful on the calculation of WW points.  I used navy beans and totally blew my day!  You might want to put this in the Points Calculator first."
296809,200676,3/28/2007,5,"I have been *yeast phobic* for decades, so making this bread was an exercise in courage for me & affection for your Jevon. I am glad to report I am no longer yeast phobic! I made a half recipe since I have just 1 loaf pan. This bread has a perfect bread texture & was *TDF* warm from the oven & slathered w/butter! I cannot wait to impress guests w/it. Kudos to Jevon for this worthy of 10* recipe. :-)"
471623,200676,4/1/2007,5,"I added rosemary, basil, fresh and powdered garlic,dried onion flakes and parsley to mine.  I LOVED IT!  It is so rich and unlike any bread I've had before.  I will definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe, SusieQusie! :)  Tell your son it's delicious!"
107583,200676,7/29/2007,5,This is just about the easiest yeast bread I have ever made!  And tasted good too!  Went well with some barley soup.  The herbs could be varied to suit the dish being serve with this.  I am going to try it with pepperjack cheese next time!
88099,200676,2/3/2008,5,"I loved this bread.  Want flavor then this is the bread for you.  I made round loafs instead of baking in the loaf pans and they turned out great.  A little work, but so worth it.  The round loafs didn't like the cheese on top.  It cracked off when sliced.  Great recipe.  Thanks"
240552,200676,3/12/2008,5,"Delicious!  I made this as our pizza crust tonight in a 9x9 pan. I baked it for 15 minutes and then loaded it up with all the goodies.  It made for a thick crust that people wanted to eat instead of leaving the crust.  Thanks, SusieQusie!!"
78808,200676,1/24/2012,5,"Wonderful, different bread!  I made exactly as directed and wouldn't have changed anything, except to have used the fresh herbs instead of dried next time around for a fresher flavor.  Thanks so much for the excellent recipe!"
2000085992,200676,6/15/2015,5,"I would give this bread more than 5 stars if I could.  I am gluten free and have not had good bread since I became so.  I made this bread just as the recipe states except I used Maninis gluten free flour mix.  The recipe calls for two pans, I put all of the dough into one pan, because gluten free does not rise as much. I ended up with a beautiful big loaf of absolutely delicious bread cooked without using rice, which is the awful staple of most gluten free items.  Thanks so much for this recipe!"
336058,214641,3/24/2007,4,"This was a nice all in one meal.  We felt the lemon was just a bit much, so we would cut the juice and zest to 1/2 lemon.  I used a salt free lemon/pepper seasoning from Penzey's called Sunny Spain.  Used w.w. rotini.  Used less mushrooms and didn't have peas.  I was out of white wine, so I used a fruit flavored kind and it worked.  Used 1 C whipping cream and 1/2 C skim milk.  The cooking time on the chicken was perfect!  This is a weekend meal, but tasted great."
374498,214641,4/24/2007,4,It was very good.  I didn't have some of the veggies (asparagus and peas) so I left then out and added some onions.  Also I purposefully left out the lemon in the sauce so it wasn't as lemony.  A very good recipe overall.
368882,214641,5/23/2007,4,"This was very tasty!  We cut back on some of the lemon, but other than that it was really good!"
1152761,214641,2/1/2009,5,"Other reviewers have said that the lemon is a little much, but my family absolutely loved it!  Don't change a thing!"
392230,218898,4/12/2007,5,"Delicious! I LOVED these wings! The wing is probably my favorite piece of the chicken. Sauced up like this with Soy, and Sweet-Chili, they are delectable! It is so, so easy to do!I cut the recipe down, because with only two of us, and this being only part of a complete Chinese meal that I was preparing, 5 lbs, would have been much more than I needed. I did have a problem with the soy sauce trying to ""burn out"" of the pan on me. This was only because by cutting down all the ingredients, I had too little liquid for the size pan I used. It was very clearly my own fault. The wings, however still came out perfect! My advise to anyone who was going to half the recipe as I did, would be to be sure and use a small enough baking pan for how many wings you have. Also, I will try covering the pan with foil during part of the time that the wings cook in the soy sauce.I would recommend this recipe to eveyone. And,it WILL be a REGULAR around here!!Thanks Ms. Pia, this is a definate keeper!"
366373,218898,4/29/2007,5,"Many thanks for sharing this recipe! Cheap, easy, delicious, and, just like you said, the meat slides right off the bone. Thanks again!!"
165326,218898,7/17/2007,5,"Gave your recipe a try on my Garden club gals potluck and it was a well liked by all. I'm a big fan of chili sauce so new I would love this simple, but great recipe. Thank you MsPia for sharing.
Lady Laura"
394077,218898,5/8/2008,5,"MsPia, Thank you for sharing your Nana's chicken wings recipes.  It is delicious.  I was so tired today coming home from work and I didn't know what to do with the drumsticks I bought.  So I used this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and it is so easy but so good."
226863,218898,9/9/2012,5,"Go ahead and get a washcloth....your gonna need it!  These are sticky and yummy. Very different from the regular wings I make for ball games.  I made half the recipe, and cut the cooking time a bit to try and keep these from burning.  These are delicious as posted, but I do recommend you line your cooking pan with foil (at least for the 2nd half of the cooking) for easier cleanup.  I'm sure we'll enjoy these again....I'd like to try this with drumsticks or thighs."
169430,250562,7/29/2009,5,I used this on chops last night and it was wonderful. The salt and garlic really sing with the sweet spices. I think this would be a delight on grilled corn also. This recipe doesn't made a large volume so if you want to do big roast I'd double this. I can't wait to try it on chicken :D. Made for Newest Zaar Tag.
545717,251014,9/5/2007,5,"Thank you, Bone Man! I was so happy to see this recipe and especially that the spice recipe was included, this was so helpful. We will use this recipe again, Kendra"
1339782,275688,7/30/2009,5,"This is the BEST and EASIEST chinese chicken recipe ever!
I made it for the first time and everyone in my house was impressed, it tastes even better then the local chinese spot's pineapple chicken."
296809,277367,6/4/2008,5,"Made for Help a Camera-less Chef Game #5 ~ Your intro could not be more accurate. This is very easily made & so lovely! I hard-boiled my eggs last nite & prepared them so they would be good to go this morning. I did start by rubbing the yolks thru a strainer, but found it easier & quicker to crumble them. A med white sauce is key as you do not want it runny-thin or gravy thick. It also should be tasted for S&P to taste pref ~ the sauce & eggs will need it. This was a very fast-fix & impressed my *breakfast hound* DH b4 he left for work. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us. :-)"
2413709,277367,3/2/2015,5,I grew up eating this dish on Sunday mornings. Everybody I have made it for absolutely loves it.
2001347642,277367,1/11/2017,5,"I was shocked there is actually a published recipe for this. My mother has made it all my life and it was our family favorite for special occasions. She calls it Eggs a la Goldenrod. Until now I thought it was a complete original. We make it slightly differently. We chop up both the hard boiled yolk and egg whites to add to the sauce, and reserve just enough grated yolk to sprinkle over the top. Either way its great, but an acquired taste."
2001379526,277367,5/19/2017,0,"I guess b/c I didn't have this growing up I was very curious as to what I had missed! So I had to try it. Well... I want to say I missed a LOT! This is much better than I thought it would be. Hard boiled eggs, white sauce and toast? big deal. YES it is a big deal I LOVE IT. I could eat it every day it's my new love I find myself waiting for tomorrow morning so I can eat it again LOL! I didn't change a thing but am thinking about Velveeta maybe even the jalapeno Velveeta. IDK it could not be any better than it is as written. How can this simple recipe with everyday ingredients be so good? Maybe it was the bread I used don't know but I can't get enough! No reason not to tyy this awesome breakfast dish it is so good."
2001995047,277367,3/6/2018,5,My best friends mother used to makes these when we had a sleep over. They were the best! I am still making them 47 years later.
2000799863,277367,8/24/2018,0,"Same receipe but I add some fresh, finely grated cheddar cheese to the white sauce and a little grated Parmesan. It's the bomb!"
498271,286132,6/9/2008,5,"This chicken was just terrific!  I was surprised by the strong presence of the chili powder but it really worked with the tangy tequila/lime and the sweet honey.  I marinated boneless skinless chicken breasts for about 6 hours, then grilled them and they were very tender and very flavorful.  This was a great chicken marinade that I will definitely use again - thanks for posting!"
130663,348864,4/18/2009,4,A very tasty meatloaf.

157425,384204,9/9/2009,5,I am not real sure how to rate this coleslaw so will go with how it tasted right after making it. Used 2 - 390 gram bags (believe it was) of coleslaw mix so doubled the bacon and ranch dressing. The bacon amount was great but needed quite a bit more dressing to make it creamy. It was a great tasting coleslaw and could not stop tasting while mixing. The bacon adds just a bit of salty flavor that really fits in well with the ranch dressing. The problem I had was after I refrigerated the cole slaw overnight the bacon became soggy and not to appealing and the ranch dressing became very watery in the bottom of the bowl. Seemed to have broke down a lot and didnt stir back into the slaw mix well at all. I used a new unopened bottle of Kraft Ranch dressing and will try this again to see what happens. Thank you Chef mariajane for sharing this recipe. Made and reviewed for the Cookbook Forums TYM - Theirs Yours & Mine photo tag game (September 09).
23119,384451,8/24/2009,5,"Quick, easy and tasty. I made as written except for the green onions. I didn't have any so I used parsely flakes. Made for New Kids on the Block."
2282107,448290,6/2/2012,0,Not the recipe they used in the resturant. This recipie is a very small batch and does not look or taste anything like the dish served in the Scottsdale resturant. I have been to the Roaring Fork many times and I like the Green Chile Mac and Cheese. This recipie doesn't even have any Green Chile in it and Green Chile is the star of this dish! I would like to see the real recipe.
169430,487965,10/30/2012,5,What a morning delight this is. I have oatmeal most mornings but this one was something special. Loved all of the flavors coming together like a small symphony for the mouth. Quick and easy to make you won't be sorry for trying this. Lovely way to brighten your morning. :D
171790,487965,8/17/2013,4,Interesting and delicious take on oatmeal. I cut the recipe in half and made as directed except for using  cup of almond milk in place of the water. I did add another 1/4 cup of water. There was one flavor I didn&#039;t care for (turmeric?). The dried apricots and dates were wonderful. Made for ZWT9 Soup A Stars.
542159,487965,8/17/2013,4,"Well what we liked about this recipe was also what made my oatmeal somewhat unattractive. We liked having the oatmeal, pine nuts and spices toasted just till fragrant (take note the will burn fast if not watched). I made as written and think that in the future will leave the brown sugar out as there is enough dried fruit. Another thing we like is how thick this was I used the amount of water called for and it turned out nice and tick so if you like thinner oatmeal you may want to add more water. Thanks for the post."
80353,487965,8/22/2013,5,Great and different way to make oatmeal.  My two oatmeal-loving-kids and I ate it up.
1052873,487965,8/22/2013,5,"This was tasty. I used 1/4 cup mixed dried fruits instead of the individual fruits.  I think I&#039;d leave the tumeric out - the yellow tinge is off-putting. Also, it&#039;s really easy to burn. Made for ZWT."
498271,487965,8/22/2013,4,"This is a robust and flavorful oatmeal!  Hearty from all the fruits and nuts and nice and creamy.  The turmeric was a bit odd but I think it really helped to balance all that cinnamon (which I enjoyed).  I went back and forth between wishing it was sweeter and being glad it wasn&#039;t and I finally decided the sweetness was just right as is.  Thanks for sharing this unusual recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
480195,487965,8/24/2013,5,"Wonderful oatmeal - better than one I make which is similar to this. I will make this often since we love oatmeal. I use steel-cut oatmeal, so I adjust cooking time and liquid accordingly. I thought the level of sweetness was perfect. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
227978,487965,8/27/2013,4,"The warm flavors in this oatmeal dish are wonderful, Dienia B.  The cinnamon was the perfect amount, and I liked the scant amount of the other spices that are so prevalent in Moroccan cuisine.  The only thing my kids and I didn&#039;t care for were the dates.  Next time, I&#039;ll stick with just raisins and dried apricots.  But everything else was wonderful.  Made for ZWT #9."
498271,330865,1/11/2009,5,"This is a wonderful smooth and relaxing tea!  I doubled the amount of tea but kept the rest of the ingredients the same and yes, I drank it all myself!  Delicious, mild little kick - just terrific.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  Made for the Comfort Cafe event, January 2009."
128473,330865,8/19/2012,5,"This was a terrific tea Annacia.  I enjoyed it very much.  I used a dark tea with black currant, added a beautiful gold rum and a little almond extract, ( don't enjoy Amaretto) and some sugar.  It was delicious, soft and subtle, very comforting and soothing.  Thanks so much for sharing my friend.  Made for Fearless Red Dragons - ZWT8 - India"
107135,330865,8/28/2012,5,followed your link from mamaphet orange scones and your right they do go well lol zaar8
31097,16918,2/14/2002,5,Very delicious; will definitely make it again.
82663,16918,6/23/2003,4,"This is a good recipe; tasted a bit like carrot or spice cake. I halved the reciped and baked it in an 8x8 cake pan for ~30 min. Still worked fine. For the frosting, I didn't have the canned cream or milk so I used half-and-half. That didn't work as well... it was more like a sauce. I poured it on any way and still tasted great. There are only 2 of us and we ate it the whole thing within an hour or two. (Ate dessert before dinner!) Will make this one again! "
7108,26706,8/19/2002,5,"My all-time favorite salad dressing is the Italian Seasonings Dressing Mix that you make in the cruette.  Well, this is just as good, if not better and definitly less expensive than paying almost $1.50 for one packet of mix.  Thanks Inez, for another great recipe!"
43005,26706,9/9/2002,5,"This is another of those ""empowering"" recipes!  I make a simple dish in which you pour a bottle of Italian dressing over chicken breasts and bake.  It's one of my daughter's favorites.  I used this recipe for the dressing and it was a hit!  Thanks Inez for giving me the way to make this from scratch and eliminate more preservatives from my family's diet!"
8688,26706,9/10/2002,5,"This is a delicious Italian dressing, Inez!  Made exactly as directed and let stand in the refridgerator for several hours to chill and allow flavors to combine.  Served with tossed greens with avocado. Simple and delicious!"
43021,26706,9/20/2002,5,This was very simple to make and tasted great!  I used it in recipe #8579.  The homemade italian salad dressing gave the beef roast gravy recipe a better flavor than storebought italian dressing.  Very nice recipe.
27678,26706,10/7/2002,5,"Inez, you've done it again! I hate buying bottled dressings that taste way too salty and are full of preservatives and second-rate ingredients. Well, now I know exactly where to turn when I need a bit of Italian dressing for my next recipe or salad. Thanks!"
93305,26706,7/8/2003,5,"Great and easy, I made one little change though since i did not have any red wine vinegar i used a 1/4 cup of burgundy and 1/4 white vinegar. AWSOME TASTE. try it you like it."
68727,26706,12/4/2003,5,"This is a good, tangy salad dressing.  I served it with a green salad.  I am happy that MIL (a gourmet cook) tasted it an approved."
33485,26706,8/29/2004,0,"This is the best salad dressing. It is not only delicious, but healthy which is a real plus. I think that when I make it next I will add even more garlic. Thanks for the recipe."
119422,26706,4/7/2005,1,"Well I hate to break the five star cycle but I signe d the honest review form soooo...We didn't care for this dressing. I did use exta virgin olive oil cold pressed. Could that be why??? Oh well, thanks anyhow!"
21399,26706,6/6/2005,5,"I threw this recipe together quickly to go with a really big sub sandwich for myself and my co-workers.  We did have time to allow it to chill and let the flavors blend for which I am grateful for.  I think chilling makes a really important difference in taste.  I didn't have any fresh garlic on hand, so used garlic powder which worked very well in a pinch. I also included a little bit of onion powder just because it seemed right. (I am sure fresh garlic and onion will be much nicer next time I make this dressing, and yes, there will be a next time.) Thanks for a delicious and easy condiment to our sandwich.  I can't wait to try it on a salad. "
65056,26706,9/30/2005,4,A pretty good basic dressing.  I found the vineger flavor a little strong- maybe more sugar would help remedy this?  All-in-all good.  Thanks!
84196,26706,5/6/2006,5,"Lovely, smooth dressing that I will use to replace store bought. I used it the first time for a    Wild  Rice Salad and again for a Pasta Salad. Thanks "
312967,26706,3/10/2007,5,"Very good salad dressing, I'm not a big fan of Italian but needed some for on my linguini salad so instead of going to the store head to recipzaar. It tasted great and I had everything in my cupboard.  Will definitely make again and will even try on my salads, maybe I do like Italian after all. thank you MizzNezz for posting."
425105,26706,4/21/2007,4,"Great dressing. One of the first I have ever made, and as easy as can be."
92816,26706,5/15/2007,3,"This dressing was ok.I found it a little too oily for my liking.I did not have red wine vinegar so I used white and balsamic,which also made it very vinegar-y.I don't know if it was just because I substituted but it was not quite what I was looking for.
I just wanted to add that I didn't really like this recipe as a salad dressing but it's excellent as a marinade.I used it on pork loin chops,it would be great on chicken too."
29196,26706,7/7/2008,5,"I'm currently in a remote area where I can't get  to the supermarket very often. I made this for another recipe, and thought it was outstanding. Simple, I had ALL the ingredients and thte taste was great."
593513,26706,11/19/2009,3,I thought it was a bit too oily myself. And it seemed no matter how much I shaked it the dressing seemed to separate very quickly. The flavor was okay though. Salad turned out great. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
1659202,26706,1/6/2011,5,This is absolutely wonderful.  The key is no substitutions and to let it chill so that the flavors meld together.  It tastes a lot like the dressing I had in Italy.  Fresh ingredients are the stars of the recipe.  The powders do not do any dressing justice.
706608,26706,9/14/2011,4,"Thank you MizzNezz! Very good quick Italian dressing. Left out the parmesan as I don't eat dairy, and added a few hot pepper flakes. Personally I thought it needed a smidge more vinegar, but that's just me. Just needed a bit more twang! But the spices/garlic are great. I have seen a lot of dressings calling for half this amount and I imagine they must be rather bland! Also love the red wine vinegar as opposed to cider. It does make the difference in my opinion! It DOES separate super fast!! Weirdly fast lol But I don't mind stirring and spooning!"
233738,26706,2/1/2012,0,"Great dressing with lots of flavor.  I appreciate that it doesn't have mayonnaise in it--this is the real thing.  I added more olive oil out of personal preference, but it was excellent even before I did."
68460,45546,1/30/2004,5,"I just had one of the best dinners ever!  This is an awesome recipe!  I halved the recipe for just me and my husband, and used all shrimp because of what I had on hand.  I used an aged New York white cheddar for the cheese.  I wasn't quite sure about the sourdough chunks but went ahead and added them per the recipe and, I have to tell you, I think that made the whole dish!  My husband and I were fishing out the bread and sopping up the sauce, it was so good!  We had this over a little mostaccioli and also had a green salad.  Thanks so much Dorothy, this is going into my 'best ever will do again and again' file!"
49542,45546,2/11/2004,5,"The first recipe my husband said was ""company worthy!""  We both loved it!  Don't let the little bit longer length intimidate you; its not that difficult.  Instructions are very clear.  I did use all scallops, as that is what I had on hand, but I'll be making this again as I think it would be a great way to use up small quantities of shrimp, scallops, crab or even lobster.  Delicious, Derf!  Thank you for an excellent recipe!"
308864,45546,4/10/2006,5,"Excellent dish!! Used both shrimps nad scallops and also used a few garlic loves and some crushed red pepper and chili powder for a nice spicy kick! Delicious! Will definitely make again, thanks for the great recipe!"
222139,45546,3/9/2009,5,I chose to make this dish for my stepsons birthday dinner.  I could not imagine a simple recipe like this coming out so good. Everybody raved how good this dish was.  Thanks Derf for making  our meal so special and memorable.  I will be making this recipe again. 10 stars!
29196,55108,9/28/2003,4,"A very nice, clean flavoured and simple to make appetiser. We made it with the parmesan cheese and really enjoyed it thank you. "
127788,69213,2/21/2004,5,"This is close to the best fish(and chips) I've ever had!  I'm doing the Low Sodium thing so instead of salt I used Garlic and Herb (no salt) seasoning.  I cooked in olive oil for the good cholestorol. When finished I seasoned with malt vinegar and lemon.  I botched the chips but that was my fault, they aren't on the recipe.  I love battered fish and chips, (can't stand the breaded stuff) and now can fix for myself!  Thanks Kittencal!"
121840,69213,6/12/2004,5,"This batter is the best we have ever eaten! I used it for grouper, which is prevalent in the Bahamas and it was light and delicious. I will use this for red snapper as well, or anything, really.  I let it set for an hour, as recommended.  It was runny, but when it hit the hot oil, boy did they puff up nice.  DH said it was better than any he has had.Thanx,Kitten"
138429,69213,7/21/2004,5,"I battered fish with this recipe and they were without a doubt the best fish we have ever eaten. I followed the recipe exactly,no changes needed.  Thank you!!!!!!"
103222,69213,9/24/2004,5,"Mmm...mmm...mmmmmmm!!!  Thought I had done something wrong when the batter was thin after 1 hour, but it came out of the pan beautifully!  Served it with lemon and some tartar sauce.  Delicious!!!  "
27416,69213,10/8/2004,5,"Just couldn't resist getting on board again.  Made the batter and I used Filet of Sole that was sliced very thin, then rolled it and used a toothpick to keep it together.  Then dipped the rolls in batter and deep fried, WOW so good and the Sole was so tasty.  Served the fish with lemon, tartar sauce and a bit of ketchup.
Many thanks again KITTENCAL. this is a great recipe.
""Uncle Bill"""
165953,69213,3/29/2005,5,We used this batter for veggies last night when we had a fondue and everything turned out amazing!  Much better then an earlier recipe we tried.  Thank you
52543,69213,4/5/2005,5,"On those rare occasions that I use the deep fryer, this will be the recipe I use! I used frozen cod (from Costco, of course) which I thawed, patted dry & cut into chunks. Served with PanNan's Tartar Sauce (#47077), your Cole Slaw (#102617), french fries & malt vinegar, it was better than Captain George's - and cheaper (LOL). Thanx for another great recipe Kitten!"
193698,69213,5/2/2005,5,Still licking my lips.  This is a great batter for fish.  Just used it on perch from Canada.  Oh my gosh!
217387,69213,6/5/2005,5,"Excellent recipe.  Made with freshwater panfish and invited guests.  By the end of the night, everyone was asking for the recipe!!  Thank you!"
50969,69213,8/21/2005,5,"i had some tilapia that i wanted to fry and i didn't want to use a lot of seasonings,this was just such a great batter. the instructions were very easy.it was very light tasting and i will use this often. thank you for posting."
2002016619,273976,3/2/2018,5,Looks yummy
134875,69213,9/11/2005,5,"Excellent!  Thank you Kittencal for such a great recipe.  I used Newcastle dark ale and Lawry's seasoned salt, omg, too divine, light, crispy, and simply fantastic.  We had some fresh Ling-Cod from Alaska, to die for!!  10 stars!"
209441,69213,9/18/2005,5,"Worth 100 stars plus! OMG what a fantastic fish coating recipe, this is better than any restaurant. I am amking this all the time now, absolute best I have ever tryed! thanks Kitty."
43478,69213,11/16/2005,5,Delicious. Perfect for Tilapia. This will be the batter I use always.  Thanks Kittencal.
185446,69213,1/23/2006,5,"Another reliable recipe from Kittencal...I've come to expect good recipes from her, and this is no exception!  Thanks!"
199213,69213,4/3/2006,5,Finally found the correct receipe. Light but very tasty.
284904,69213,6/5/2006,5,This is the best i've tried and i've tried a lot of recipes for fish batter.. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I always look for Kittencal's recipes.. So glad you posted it.  Thanks......
47865,69213,6/17/2006,5,Outstanding! Wonderful for onion rings too!
11176,69213,7/18/2006,5,"The lightest, most devine fish batter I've ever had.  How do you DO that, Kitten? I used orange roughy cut into pieces with the seasoned salt. Forgot to beat the egg white (oops!), but it was still perfect.  Straight into my Encore cookbook, thank you yet again! "
288143,69213,12/12/2006,5,This is the best beer batter i have ever used!! Be sure you let it sit for 1 hour. I was in a hurry and it does make a difference. I have been asked for this recipe 2 times and only served it once to a group of 10 so that should tell you how great it it..
176665,69213,1/28/2007,5,"AWESOME fish batter.  Not too thick not too thin.  The batter really lets the fish taste come through but gives the fish a nice crisp outside.  If you are searching for a light weight, great tasting batter for fish this one is #1.  I used it on crappies and sunfish that my husband caught this weekend ice fishing her in Wisconsin.

Once again AWESOME receipe thank you so much for sharing it!"
309368,69213,2/23/2007,5,"This was my first attempt at frying fish, and it was a success.  I used Tilapia, and it turned out great!  Thanks!"
476143,69213,5/31/2007,5,"This was super, we used red king snapper and it was so tasty and easy to make, thanks for a great recipe :-)"
452749,69213,6/2/2007,5,This was excellent!! I'm leary about seasonings so I didn't add enough seasoned salt as I should have-next time I will but the batter is wonderful. I used talipia and it was just awesome. Thanks Kittencal!
593832,69213,9/21/2007,5,Absolutely delicious!  Very light and crispy.  Definitely recommend!
185726,69213,11/4/2007,5,Oh my goodness! These were SPECTACULAR! I made this exactly as the recipe states and used fresh Tilapia then each cut into chunks. My picky eater husband mumbled words of delight as he was gobbling it down and then insisted on having seconds. A TIP: When taking done pieces out of the hot oil keep in mind if you let them sit for too long on the paper towels to soak up the oil the oil soaked towels can the make the nice crispy batter resting against them to turn slightly soggy. Mostly on the flatter portion of this fish where the batter is thin and spread even. Keep the paper towels underneath changed to dry ones and/or prop the pieces up on their sides works perfectly to retain that nice crunchy texture. My search for the perfect fried fish recipe ends here! Many thanks Kittencal!
514992,69213,11/27/2007,5,Easy to make and came out perfect - Thanks!
437974,69213,12/30/2007,5,This was EXCELLENT! We used the batter on jumbo shrimp; and they were delicious! :)
164674,69213,2/1/2008,5,"I live in Minnesota and have always had Pan Fish or Walleye in a beer batter.  Just made this with a mess of crappies from the ice.  (It's January now.)  WOW! this is the best batter I have ever used. It would be great with Walleye.  The batter had a hard time holding at less than 320 degrees and cooked perfectly at 350 with a cast iron skillet.

I made this as described. Very thin batter, when cooked it is crisp and light. 

If you wish for a thicker batter chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.  Chill your fish as well.

Kittencal you have done it again.  Thanks"
134124,69213,4/2/2008,4,"I soaked my fish in buttermilk for a few hours and wondered if I shoud not have done that as the batter did not ""stick"" as well as it should have. I added paprika and garlic salt to the batter for a little more flavor. It was light and crispy and will make this again. Only thing I did not like was cleaning my stove after !!! 
pollyw"
164368,69213,4/20/2008,5,Yummy & light!
818606,69213,6/29/2008,5,"Awesome light and fluffy beer batter.  I recommend using Old Speckled Hen in the bottle if you're going for uthenticity.  We used this recipe to make fish and chips with wild caught haddock.  It was excellent.

If anyone has any good recipes for the chips, I'd love to have one."
881884,69213,7/5/2008,5,"This was an  exceptional batter! I used  San Miguel light beer, omitted the egg, just used the whites and it was still very good. Read somewhere that you have to dredge the fish on cornstarch to make the batter stick beautifully so that's what i did before frying.   I used creamy Dori fish-terrificcc!"
411409,69213,8/3/2008,5,"I have made this twice now. Once with cod and once with Ling cod (fresh out of the ocean!)
They were both really good! I am going to try Halibut next (caught in the Queen Charlottes!) Can't wait! Thanks for a good recipe!"
631194,69213,8/27/2008,5,Very good and it really taste great with tarter sauce! I tried it with cod very good DH loved it.
952393,69213,9/11/2008,5,Great! My husband and I have never had fish & chips before because I'm not a fan of fried foods but this batter was simple and light. We really enjoyed it! I added garlic and herb seasoning and paprika. Thank You!
956191,69213,9/15/2008,5,"This is a great recipe for deep frying fish.  It sticks enough to the fish (as long as the fish is dry) for a nice, even coat.  When it comes out of the fryer, it is a beautiful golden crust.  A crunchy, thin layer of flavor is there to greet you, unlike most recipes which make me feel like I've ended up with more batter than fish.
This is my new go-to recipe for battering my fried fish.  Adding different spice combinations can yield some delicious results!"
459426,69213,10/2/2008,5,"Awesome! Really really excellent.  Used with a strong German beer and really couldn't fault a thing.  Wonder how hot oil should be. I had it at 190C and I think it might have been a bit too hot! Also would love tips on how to keep each portion crispy whilst frying the rest.  I put them on stoneware in the oven at a low temp.  Most remained fairly crispy, but the ones I fried first were starting to get a bit limper as I served.  Served with chips (fries) mushy peas with bacon and roasted red pepper tartar sauce. Dee-lish. Will be a staple here for sure! :)"
904483,69213,12/13/2008,5,"This was first rate! We are fishermen/women in this house and have a freezer full!'
Used this on Walleye and was not disappointed in the slightest!
You are recipe searchers dream come true Kittencal! For sure!
Jelly in love! Many thanks! DH is the food critic here and he said it was 5 star! Maisy had a few bites and gave it 5 Paws!!!!!"
1056391,69213,1/7/2009,5,I used the batter on shrimp and it got great reviews!  I did dredge the shrimp in flour first to get the batter to stick a bit better.  I did as another reviewer suggested and chilled the batter for 1/2 hr after letting it set @ room temp for 1 hr.  I fryed the shrimp @ 350 and they turned out a lovely golden color.  Thanks for posting!
218535,69213,1/21/2009,3,I find the batter to be too thin.
610084,69213,3/10/2009,4,"I give it a 4 only for the lack of seasoning.We did follow other's input on adding garlic salt and also an overall ""season salt"".However,the batter is 5 stars in how it crisps up and coats the fish.We used a ""true"" cod and it worked great! I also made recipe #26451(White Fish In Herbed Butter) and my husband who usually prefers fried,asked me to make this recipe next time! Both are good enough we will for sure make again!"
1244045,69213,4/28/2009,5,WOW! I've never used a wet batter before and it was awesome. I used talapia and it came out perfect. I did add some Zatarains to spice it up a bit. Thank you my hubby loved it!
452921,69213,12/15/2009,5,The coating is nice and light and turns our real well. First time I made this I made the mistake of using frozen cheap fish - turned out inedible. This time I used fresh cod and the fish was perfect.
1271713,69213,3/24/2010,5,"delicious, i used fresh cut halibut and gluten free beer instead of regular beer"
1049139,69213,7/30/2010,5,"Yummy! Kittencal, you've done it again.  :)  I was listening to a baby cry instead of following the recipe, and I dumped more beer than it called for...by about 4 oz, but just by adding more flour, it turned out simply delightful. LIght and crispy."
593513,69213,8/26/2010,5,"What a delicious batter Kitten. I didn't have dark beer so I had used my Canadian beer instead but I don't think that made a difference. Have to find a place that sells single bottles for the next time. I had used the seasoning salt and added a dash of the garlic powder and cayenne. For the fish I used Grouper. I sprinkled it with a bit of flour first then dipped it in the batter which worked out fantastic and then it went into the deep fryer. It turned out with such a nice light crispness, I surprised myself by eating all of it up. My friend really loved his too and commented on how great it was..I served it with some steak fries and tartar sauce...mmmm.......mmmm.....mmmm...such a yummy lunch..I have said it so many times Kitten that your recipes never fail me. I will be making this again soon. Thanks for sharing Kitten, we loved it."
1657616,69213,11/11/2010,5,We loved this recipe! Will add a little salt next time though.
140132,69213,2/28/2011,5,This is a nice light batter for the fish.  I was making fish tacos and needed a batter for my fish and chose your recipe.  It was wonderful.  I had some extra batter so I threw in some mushrooms.  They turned out great.  Thank you for this versitile recipe that we will use many times.
1170903,69213,3/20/2011,4,"Followed the recipe, and it turned out great!"
836135,69213,6/1/2011,5,Awesome batter.  We used the batter with tilapia and fresh mushrooms. Even the non fish eater in the family enjoyed the fish.
661999,69213,4/11/2012,5,Excellent batter~  Light and crispy.  I used haddock fillets and should have made more because the whole family loved it.  Thanks Kittencal fro another great recipe.
2198343,69213,6/3/2014,4,"We cut the fish into bite size pieces, which makes it more fun to eat and you get more light and crispy batter with each bite."
378487,69213,2/15/2016,0,"Delicious batter! I was surprised at how thin the batter was, but it stuck nicely to my fish and cooked up golden and crispy! Thanks for sharing, your recipes are always a hit I&#039;m my book! ?"
39864,72931,1/29/2004,5,This is a great sauce!  We have used it over pork loin and chicken breasts as well.  It makes for a very quick but elegant dinner.  
180956,82529,12/21/2004,4,Great recipe.  Used for christmas gifts.  Will use again
126272,93133,6/21/2004,5,"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!  EVERYONE loved this dip.  Served it with veggies and a sour dough bread to dip in it.  It was VERY well received. This will be added to my party dip collection!"
425154,93133,10/22/2007,5,"I took this dip to a teacher dinner night, and everyone asked for the recipe!  I almost hate to tell them how easy this is, but I guess I'll share.  Thanks!"
1301067,98536,6/13/2011,4,I am not a big zucchini bread fan. It is usually way to sweet. This was great. I used brown sugar instead of white. This will be a standard go to zucchini recipe in my house.
88378,180137,6/15/2010,5,"Simple and delicious.  This made such a wonderful light dinner served alongside brown basmati rice with toasted almonds.  I did not have red pepper, so I added a little fresh tomato for color and it actually tasted good in there.  We just enjoyed this thoroughly and will remember it for a quick, easy meal that's perfectly satisfying and  nutritious.  Thanks for posting this!"
9580,206087,2/22/2007,5,"This is a fantastic recipe using lowfat ingredients.  I used frozen chopped broccoli with excellent results.  Next time I will try this without a crust for an even lower calorie meal.
This is a great breakfast!"
66448,206087,10/11/2007,5,"I just took this out of the oven & could hardly wait to try it, OMG it was delious! I had a real hard time not going back for a 2nd. piece! I have trouble with portion control, if it's good I want to keep eating it! I don't like eggbeaters at all by themself but mixed in someting no problem...I did use my own piecrust though, I am a homemade piecrust snob, I used red peppers & green onions though..but followed everything else. Very very good! I'll be making this for a long time!"
207907,206087,10/17/2007,5,"Oh Riff, this was so yummy!DoryJean54
recommended I make this and I am so happy I did! I must admit I didn't use the crust because I just have to skip the extra calories.I am so glad I decided to do this because the egg mixture is wonderful all by itself and I could eat more of it:) Thank you so much for posting your creation."
114468,206087,1/1/2008,5,I made this for Christmas Morning without the crust.  FANTASTIC!  Leftovers reheated very well.  And it fits very nicely into our healthier lifestyle.
443203,208694,2/2/2007,5,easy to make. the best ever. my kids enjoyed it with the chocolate chips.
151638,208694,5/25/2007,5,Great recipe easy to follow and very good kids loved it .Will keep useing this one.Stays very moist i added mint chocolate chips .Very good .... :)
420968,302859,8/3/2009,5,Very good! I marinated overnight and it tasted great.  Served it with mango/black bean salsa.
369715,327779,11/10/2008,4,I couldn't find a 15 ounce can of campbells tomato soup (or any other can of that size soup) so I used a 10 ounce can. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. For me the soup with the cheese was too thick so had to add about another half of can of milk. I also didn't add salt or pepper.
537179,327779,12/21/2008,4,I made this for DH and he's a cheese fanatic. He liked it pretty good. Said it was a nice change from the same ole same ole. Made as written. Thanks for posting. Made for 123 hits dec 2008.
96177,327779,7/16/2009,5,"Very good. I added fresh ground pepper and seasoned oyster crackers, yummmy. Made for photo tag."
498271,327779,12/2/2009,4,"I already love tomato soup so I knew this was going to be great!  I used Velveeta for ease of melting but I think swiss or monterrey jack would be good too.  I added cracked pepper but no extra salt.  Served this as I always do, with Ritz crackers, and really enjoyed - thanks for sharing your recipe!"
166642,327779,12/30/2009,4,A nice change from the plain tomato soup. I loved it. Thanks for sharing! Made for Gimme 5 tag.
1535,349022,2/11/2010,4,"After being w/o power all day, it came back on right before bedtime. I quickly threw all the fresh vegetables, raw chicken, broth and bouillon into the crock pot, so I could cook it overnight for the next day's lunch. The next morning, I added the tomatoes and beans and turned the crock pot down to ""warm"". Everything cooked up nice and tender. I really don't think you need to precook the chicken. It literally fell apart it was so tender. I skipped the butter and Tabasco sauce since I didn't need the fat, and I don't care for too much heat."
1700011,349022,10/8/2010,4,Made this last night and its already gone! The whole house smelled incredible and it tasted even better. I skipped the Tabasco and parsley but otherwise did the exact recipe. Its definitely a recipe I'm keeping. Thanks!
1617537,349022,10/27/2010,5,This was excellent. Loved it!
1659272,349022,11/1/2010,5,"I made this over the weekend when our weather was a bit chilly here in the midwest.  I put it all together in the morning and it was ready by early evening.  My house smelled wonderful and my kids even ate with us.  NO leftovers here!!!  Thanks for sharing, this was an amazing meal!!!"
989355,349022,12/7/2010,5,"Excellent.  My whole family loved this.  Not a bland soup at all, full of flavor"
2086708,349022,11/29/2011,0,"When I look for slow cooker recipes, I do not like to do anything that requires something to be already cooked (like the chicken and canned beans in this soup recipe.) So I used two large, frozen chicken breasts and a couple handfuls of dried white beans (not pre-soaked, pre-cooked) and cooked it on high turning it to low for the last couple of hours) and it turned out great. I like to use dried beans instead of canned because they are so much cheaper. The only change I make when using dried beans is to use a little more liquid than the recipe calls for. Hope that helps others make this fantastic recipe even a little easier!"
2460127,349022,11/3/2012,4,One pot meals are always a convenience.  I used frozen chicken breasts and chopped them before putting them in the crock pot and stewing initially on high.  A bit too salty; perhaps it is best to use one bouillon cube or eliminate the bouillon all together.  A nice winter afternoon soup.
333394,349022,6/20/2013,5,"This was SO good and satisfying :-) I used my own stock and wound up using way less chicken (probably a breast&#039;s worth), which I think I could have gotten away with even less; my husband and I prefer less meaty soups. It was very satisfying and almost too filling, though I do not strain my stock (personal preference; the additional fat makes it more filling). I also added a bay leaf, a bit of Italian seasoning, and instead of the bullion added a bit more salt. I skipped the parsley and hot sauce too. This is delicious with Monterrey Jack cheese on the side and I think a nice crusty loaf of bread would make this a meal for guests :-)"
1441804,349022,4/3/2014,5,"This is a super easy slow cooker recipe, and it tastes delicious. Our whole family loves it (except Ms Picky who doesn&#039;t like anything). After reading the reviews I used fresh chicken, which turned out great. I used bouillon cubes &amp; water for all the broth called for."
1620171,349022,6/2/2014,5,"I cheated and used our pressure cooker. Used frozen chicken cut into bits and six cups of stock, no bullion. Didn&#039;t make any changes to ingredients. Recommend giving it time to reduce as apparently 6 cups is a bit much, but we were hungry and it tasted just fine anyway."
208755,349022,10/16/2014,4,"Simple and delicious! I also just used raw chicken and cut it into bite-sized chunks. I added some Italian seasoning near the end. I am thinking about trying it sometime without the tomatoes, too, because I sampled it before I put them in, and it was pretty good. Like many foods, this was even better the next day. Thanks for sharing it!"
2001280507,349022,12/3/2016,0,"I make myn with spices in a spice holder-( star aniseed about three,,a few bay leaves,,a small handful of pepper corns (20) ) and add 1-teas of tumeric plus 1/4 teas cayanne pepper-powder))) Very healthy. also woth nice fresh sour dough bread &amp; butter and sometimes with cabbage added."
2000431901,349022,6/20/2017,5,"I skipped the bouillon cubes, but otherwise kept the ingredients as written. Use my pressure cooker for 30 minutes and it was delicious!"
212497,362066,8/2/2011,5,"This is THE BEST pork chop stuffing bake that I've ever made! The only thing that I changed is that I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom. The kids inhaled this, my husband inhaled this...I INHALED THIS! I honestly couldn't put my fork down! The pork stayed really moist and tender and the cheese kind of melted into the soup mixture. Plus the stuffing on top got crispy. I will ABSOLUTELY make this one again!"
424680,362066,1/26/2012,5,"We had a wonderfully satisfying meal with this recipe, & the only change I made was to use cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom kind, & another time I might just change that to a cream of potato soup! This was just for the 2 of us, & the leftovers made for a second very delicious meal! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Made & reviewed in Went to the Market recipe tag]"
324390,402582,5/28/2010,5,I can see why he would get homesick and make these. They truly taste like something someone's grandmother would make- I just can't believe that now I can make them too! I had left over filling so I used it to fill some left-over wraps I had from a different recipe and steamed them as well as made some fried wontons. We loved all the ways! I'm not sure what the finished product was supposed to look like but I sure can say that they tasted wonderful. Thanks Coasty. Made for ZWT 6 by an Unruly.
37449,480526,7/27/2012,5,This is a nice version of the ever so popular Ranch dressing. I loved the fresh dill and parsley.  I used soy milk in place of dairy. Thanks! Made for Newest Zaar tag.
653438,480526,10/8/2012,5,Cut the recipe down and I wish I would have made the full amount...so DELICIOUS!   I followed the instructions adding a pinch of sugar (added a little more vinegar than stated by mistake) and a little basil that I needed to use up.  Wonderful and going into my Favorites of 2012.  Thank you for posting.  Made for Fall Pick a Chef tag game 2012.  P.S.  I did use the buttermilk option.
305531,480526,10/12/2012,5,Loved this salad. I made one serving just for me and thought the dressing was very good. Thanks linguinelisa for sharing. Congrats on your win for the Football Pool.
266635,480526,3/21/2013,5,"Pioneer Woman definitely lived up to her reputation with this delicious salad dressing.  Easy to make and so much better and more flavorful than store-bought.  I&#039;m sure it will only get better with time -- of course, it&#039;s going on my dinner salad tonight and then we&#039;ll see if there is any left - probably not! Made for Spring PAC, March, 2013."
1786911,480526,6/10/2015,5,Great stuff particularly if you have fresh herbs but can get by with dried in  pinch
2001649031,480526,8/14/2017,5,"A really great tasting, thick ranch. The trick is to let it sit in the fridge for a while before you eat it. I personally might cut back on the garlic, parsley and dill but overall it was steak house ranch which is my favorite."
1706426,503977,7/23/2013,5,"Quite good! I loved the splash of orange. I went very light on the cinnamon and sugar and it was just perfect. Thanks for sharing! Made for Ramadan, 2013"
1052873,503977,8/22/2013,5,"How can you go wrong with cinnamoned peaches? Tastes like peach pie, my favorite! Made for ZWT9."
804550,503977,12/5/2013,5,"I had to make this recipe using oranges as I chose the wrong time of year for peaches apparently. Anyway, I used navel oranges and it made for a very nice dessert. Made for NA*ME tag."
418718,514852,3/25/2014,5,your recipe sounds very good!
2201427,514852,3/25/2014,5,Sounds delicious ...... a must try..... 5 stars for sure!!
2198132,514852,3/26/2014,5,Sounds yummy!
2216338,514852,3/27/2014,5,sounds like a winner! sw?
2201870,514852,3/28/2014,5,Yum
51756,39944,6/25/2003,5,These were good and easy to make.I tried them last week and everyone liked them! Thanks
158604,39944,1/13/2005,0,"we do something similar, but we learned during a poweroutage and did it in a fireplace, add fennel, and cilantro,plus we also added yams, and parsnips.
 It's excellent, especially on a cold winter night. build up the fire after and enjoy."
49304,49413,4/3/2003,5,"Miss Annie, The pork is sensational. DH piged out on it. Gravy was delicious served  with bow tie noodles. I used very lean country style(boneless)ribs. Worked great. Hadn't used my pressure pan in ages. Thank you for another great recipe."
200702,49413,3/6/2005,3,"We are exploring the use of our pressure cooker and happened on this recipe via Barb's recommendation.  It was very ""home cooking"" style; but not our favorite."
316274,49413,5/7/2006,5,"Fabulous recipe, I swiped some of my puppy Rufus's baby peeled carrots (his favorite healty treat) to throw in.  Got to have my veggies.  I was out of allspice too & had  to substitute cloves, cinnamon & nutmeg, which I had.  Now I am thinking of trying this with potatoes next time?  What do you think?  I now I will have to add a bit more beer..... tee heee!"
107583,49413,3/9/2009,5,"I am still learning how to use my pressure cooker, and this recipe was perfectly written and turned out great!  Loved the gravy.  I also threw in some baby carrots on top of the onions.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Will be making this again!  I am looking forward to trying it with a darker beer, also."
115525,54806,1/21/2006,4,"Very rich, nice flavor - just what I was looking for.  The pudding was not too firm and not too soft.  My only problem was that it was a bit grainy, and not as smooth as I would like.  It could be my technique.  I need to remember to use a nice heavy bottomed- or non-stick pot.  I'm keeping this recipe!  It's as close as I've been to the tapioca of my dreams!"
316094,54806,3/3/2007,5,"Outstanding old-fashioned tapioca pudding!  I loved the custardy taste and the creaminess. My only change in the recipe was to use 1/2 c. sugar and 1/2 c. Splenda. It turned out more than sweet enough, and I couldn't even tell that the sugar was reduced by more than half. I had to stir throughout the entire cooking process because the milk (I used 2%) was sticking a little to the bottom of my pot, and I tempered the egg mixture before adding it (which made all the difference in preventing that grainy, ""cooked egg"" texture). I will definitely be making this on a regular basis!"
38218,59138,9/16/2003,5,"Ooooh! This was GOOD!  I've always just eaten halvah.  It never ocurred to me that I could actually COOK with it. And I love baked apples.  What an incredible recipie!  Easy, fast and oh! so good.  I can hardly wait to have the leftover for breakfast tomorrow.     "
20114,60759,4/29/2003,5,"I made this for a picnic and served it at room temperature and everyone liked it except me ... so I heated it up and tried it again and it was fantastic!!!! 
The flavors are wonderful - I highly recommend this for people trying to eat low carb.
As far as whether to eat hot or cold - it depends on if you're wierd like me :-)"
56670,60759,6/26/2003,5,"This was REALLY good!!  I served it hot and added a few slices of deli ham (chopped)into it.  My dad is on the Atkins diet, so this was great for him along with the salad I served with it, thanks, I wil def. be making this again...I already have requests from my dad :)!!"
74516,60759,3/23/2004,5,"I was not in the mood to cook anything time consuming tonight and wanted something light and relatively healthy. This turned out to be just what I was looking for. Very easy to put together and my family thought it was delicious. Tasted kind of like a quiche or omelet. Used Monterey Jack cheese. Thanks Theresa, will be using this one again."
96995,60759,7/9/2005,5,"Easy to make! Delicious!
Even my 6 year old who will have nothing to do with zucchini beyond zucchini bread ate every bite.
Thanks!"
357323,60759,2/14/2007,5,I was a little skeptical at first but I just made this and had a taste and I was pleasantly surprised! The cayenne pepper gives it a nice kick. I used green onions and Italian blend cheese. I will certainly be making this again.
400817,60759,4/17/2007,4,My family devoured this--I could hardly believe it. I think I will add another egg next time; I would like a more balanced egg:zucchini ratio.
726142,60759,2/13/2008,4,"My 10 yr. old doesn't like zucchini. He thought it was okay. I doubt he would complain about eating it again. On the other hand, I thought it was excellent. My boyfriend and I went back for seconds. I will definitely be making this again and again."
358836,60759,6/15/2008,5,"DELICIOUS!! I used about 1 3/4 cups shredded mozzarella & 1/4 cup grated Romano cheese (we like the stronger cheese taste).   I sprinkled a handful of mozzarella over the top before baking.  Also, used regular pepper instead of cayenne (had a few people who cannot have the added spice).  SOOO Yummy...My mother in law couldn't stop raving about it and asked for the recipe!  Such an easy veggie to prepare!  Thanks!"
323186,60759,6/26/2008,5,"Made this last night, simple, straightforward, a lovely mid-week supper dish, served with rice, garlic mushrooms, and sweetcorn.   
Even my daughters, who don't care for zucchini, ate it happily (after hopefully investigating the oven for a meat dish - not tonight, girls!)

Thank you for a good recipe that I shall make again :)"
1675225,60759,8/1/2012,3,"This was just okay for me.  I've made zuchinni pie with a crust and prefer that recipe.  I cooked this 25 minutes, and maybe it was a little too long for my oven, as I didn't like the browned cheese on top."
52448,62969,6/24/2003,4,"A dessert I liked but there were mixed feelings at the table. It also looked beautiful and it was creamy, it still has an avocado flavor but sweet. 
Thats when I got the idea to get the tequila and a creamy coconut liqueur out the cupboard and let people mix that into their glass to their own liking.
They did and there was nothing left!"
4470,62969,8/13/2003,4, If you don't say what they are eating few will know it's avocado. Lovely smooth dessert but is did need a little perk so just before serving I added about 1/4 oz of Cointreau over top of each glass. Everyone enjoyed the dessert and most were surprised when I told them that it was avocado.  I was surprised that the calorie count is as low as it is and even the fat count is not bad when compared to other rich desserts Thanks Daydream for a winner
111520,62969,9/28/2007,4,"I didn't chill it!  No time! Next time, I promise! But it was yummy yummy yummy yummy!!! well at least the avocados and cream were cold.  I whipped the cream first and then folded in the rest and used organic fine sugar.  Might put it in a shell next!"
222478,76596,1/9/2007,5,"Wow! A really great and simple idea and the combination of smoked salmon, spices and cream cheese works really well together. These can be knocked together very quickly but look and taste classy."
333017,76596,12/13/2008,5,"Beautiful combination of cream cheese and smoked salmon.  Perfect for me as they can be made up ahead of time, easy to assemble and wonderful to taste!  I love capers, so I have added those too."
1039247,76596,12/17/2008,4,Nice and easy!  and really yummy!
113828,98967,4/17/2005,5,"We grilled chicken legs cut up and put into the sauce & vegatables, was excellant over the baked potatoe,I also served it over white rice just as good,this would make a great dish with any type of meat!!!Thanks Kendra."
228458,174232,6/3/2007,5,"Wow...you're not kidding when you call these babies fluffy!! They were nice and thick, and the nutmeg really added a nice subtle difference to the flavor. DH and I agree that this one is a keeper! One small change--I realized I was out of wheat germ so I subbed in some oat bran. Still tasted great!"
104295,174232,6/7/2007,4,"My kids wanted pancakes or waffles for breakfast so I started looking at recipes.  I had some fat free buttermilk to use up, plus some over-ripe bananas, so this worked out well.  As written we enjoyed these a lot.  I did use oat bran instead of wheat germ (like smelly vegetarian suggested).  We thought that there was too much nutmeg for our taste.  But when I added a generous shake of chocolate chips, that issue went away!  The texture on these is lovely and I will probably use this recipe as my banana chocolate chip pancake recipe.  While the chocolate chips don't increase the health value, I figure that when I start with a healthy base I'm doing better to add the chocolate chips to that base instead of starting with a butter laden base!  Thanks for a great one."
88099,174232,10/4/2008,5,I thought these were really good pancakes.  I made half the recipe using 2 egg whites.  I made everything else as directed and they turned out light and fluffy.  Well I did use splenda for the sugar.  They were easy to put together  Added a little sugar free maple syrup and a few slices of banana.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for PAC Fall 08
19129,234964,12/22/2007,5,"Anyone tackling this will be rewarded with an exceptionally delicious cake, which I hesitate to call fruitcake with its unpopular connotations. Here are my suggestions: First, rewrite the directions, distilling them to just the basics (sorry Cody). I did this in my Mastercook software. I halved the recipe and came out with 2 1/2 lbs. fruit. I chopped the fruit finely but not all the way to a paste - it filled to the brim a quart mason jar. I then poured in as much rum as it would hold (maybe several cups) and turned the jar over every several days for about a month. I baked it in two regular size loaf pans for 2 3/4 hours. I would have preferred the mini loaf pans but forgot to get them. The loaves are now wrapped in cheesecloth which I've soaked several times with more rum, and then wrapped in foil. Really excellent, and definitely worth the time and trouble. Thanks, Cody!"
452940,257171,3/24/2008,5,"Marra, thanks so much for posting this great recipe! It is quite simple to put together although it may seem otherwise. I did change the cooking temp/time to 250F for 3 hours so as to infuse the flavors even moreso as they were wonderfully armoatic on the stovetop during that portion of the cooking. Well, when I took it from the oven, opened the lid and looked in... mmmmmm! A wonderful aroma again! I plated up the chicken, and was ready to prepare the roux, but I stirred the carrots and onion in the ready made sauce and decided that that is/would be the roux! Why waste those luscious veggies, and an already creamy broth?! So I omitted step #5 altogether. What a delightful treat! I served this fork-tender chicken with some buttered egg noodles. Yum!"
623266,355,2/14/2008,5,"This is my husband's favorite apple crisp recipe.  He doesn't like apple crisp made with oats so I thought this was perfect ... and he agreed!  I omit the salt if I use salted butter.  Also, it takes approximately 8-10 apples to fill a 9 x 13 dish."
713116,257171,4/17/2008,5,"This is a rich, hearty dish that smells heavenly while cooking!  I used boneless, skinless breasts, but I followed the cooking times pretty much as directed.  I was able to cook the entire meal in my dutch oven, so clean up was a breeze, too.  The chicken turned out absolutely succulent and tender.
I made the roux and the sauce as directed, but as the previous reviewer mentioned, I also served the chicken on a bed of the carrots and onions, then spooned the sauce over top.  
Divine!  thanks for sharing!"
1481382,323105,12/13/2009,1,"Directions unclear if it is 4-ounces of pudding mix after milk is added per box instructions or if it is 4-ounces of the dry pudding mix. i.e. 3-boxes of the dry.

469716,343369,10/21/2009,5,"I've been looking and looking for a good sugar cookie recipe that would hold its shape when baked, but still be soft (not crispy).  This recipe did the trick.  I made 3 dozen perfect ghost cookies today, and 2 dozen perfect pumpkin cookies yesterday.  The cookie is a wonderful buttery/sugary cookie that is still soft when cooled.  Make sure you watch the cookies and take them out when you see the first signs of golden-brown on the bottom.  I rolled and re-rolled the dough many times and all the cookies were perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe!!"
5060,343369,2/6/2010,5,"Lovely sugar cookies, a little difficult to roll but turned out great and made a huge amount.  I made them for a Valentine's Day afternoon tea.  Made them in different sized heart shapes and iced them, DH loved them so did everyone else. Thanks for posting."
350812,411194,3/18/2010,5,"This was YUMMY!!!  Have to admit I made a fair number of changes though.  Instead of doing steps 1-3, I roasted the barley because I find the texture is much firmer that way.  I also bought a package of precooked presliced Hormel Naturals chicken breast.  The grape tomatoes @ my grocery store didn't impress me, so I used a can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes.  I'm not a fan of kalamata olives or reduced fat feta, so I skipped the olives and used 1/2c of regular feta.  I also am not a fan of salad dressings, so I skipped that and just sprinkled some dried mint & basil on the finished product.  But in the end - this made for a FABULOUS lunch today!!  This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!"
1846821,411194,3/6/2011,0,This is a wonderful recipe.  As a newbie vegetarian I used water instead of broth and omitted the chicken.  Also added much more olive oil and italian dressing for moistness and flavor.  HEAVENLY!
1108749,415157,4/12/2010,5,LOVE this!  I acctually tried this ages ago (I found it on the Food Network site).  It might just be my favorite way to have oatmeal.  Thanks for posting!
573325,415157,10/12/2012,5,"I am a fan of this, too. :) It is such a great way to start your day, very creamy and satisfying. I really enjoyed the addition of flax seeds.<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this keeper with us, Sunday!<br/>Made and reviewed for Think Pink Tag October 2012."
679953,424835,7/31/2010,5,"Hallejulia !! These are awesome !!  Made recipe as posted with no adjustments.  Loved the cumin on these as you can taste it, just right, and not overpowering.  I did marinate these for 8 hours, as suggested as these hit the spot.  Made for Market tag."
509357,473508,5/26/2014,5,This drink is very refreshing!!!! Awesome on a hot summer day!! Love the limeade mixed with vodka....you can also put it in the blender!!
4796,355,10/10/2002,5,I was looking for a recipe to use up some of these apples someone gave me and I came upon this recipe - I was a little skeptical (sounded too easy to be good) - IT WAS TERRIFIC! Thanks!
50575,355,10/14/2002,4,This recipe is every mother's dream for something quick and good. Pair it with ice cream.
37471,355,10/15/2002,5,Simple to make....yummy to eat! Thanks much for the recipe!
172169,355,11/30/2004,4,Great and simple. Amazing how healthy food can taste good too ;-)
311258,355,4/25/2006,5,I use this recipe for our little community center lunch occassionally and it goes over very well. Thanks for a great easy and delicious dessert
141453,355,4/25/2007,4,"A little sweet for my liking, but delicious nonetheless."
2001941662,389287,1/19/2018,5,They were great. I added extra applesauce and ginger
587978,355,10/4/2009,5,"This was very yummy!  Eating it as I type this, all hot and gooey.  Thanks for the recipe.  I used 6 large granny smiths, and it filled a 13x9 pan quite nicely."
463763,355,1/7/2010,0,:)
412147,17195,3/13/2008,4,"I liked how easy this recipe was to make.  I prepped most of it ahead of time, so I was able to make it quickly.  I enjoyed the sweetness of the pineapple, the flavors of the sauce - I'm just not sure about the cucumber - even though I love cucumbers.  I will make this again, and I'm glad I have enough for seconds."
28346,107861,3/15/2005,4,"A nice light and simple dessert.  I had no mandarins on hand, so we just had strawberries and bananas, but it was still yummy.  Tossed the fruit with some amaretto rather than almond extract, and I used fat free Cool Whip.  BF has asked for a repeat on this one."
209441,117897,5/15/2005,5,"Wonderful little cakes. The cherry filling kind of bakes in with the topping crumble. I will try this with other pie filling too, and I was thinking that mabey this would work baking it in just one tart shell? I'll make this again. Thank you!"
25792,135470,8/23/2006,5,I didnt change anything on the recipe but to used dried tarragon instead of the fresh.  These were very rich and flavorful mashed potatoes.  The buttermilk and fresh spices really enhanced them.  Thanks Marcie for a recipe that we all loved!
80353,135470,9/5/2006,4,"Very, very good.  Loved the buttermilk addition and the fact that I didn't need to use a load of butter.  The minced herbs were delicious in this and we happily scarfed this down with pork chops."
296809,135470,11/19/2006,4,"I really enjoy recipes like this, versatile ones that take you where you lead them. These potatoes were served with recipe #159214, so I took them to the SW. I subbed cilantro for the tarragon & parsley + added garlic & a few drops of Tobasco for a bit of a heat level. Like Ev, I liked that they were not loaded w/butter & got their creamy flavor from the combo of buttermilk & seasonings. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us."
482933,135470,5/10/2008,5,"Oh my these were fabulous!  Had them with barbecued ribs, steamed broccoli, salad, and pineapple sherbert.  They are perfect!  Thanks for sharing a keeper.  Tomorrow we are having the leftovers in a breakfast casserole and looking forward to it."
242766,135470,7/26/2008,5,"Delicious! These potatoes were a wonderful change from standard mashed potatoes.  The buttermilk gave the potatoes a creamy texture and added a sour cream-like tang.  We really loved the flavor the fresh herbs added. I used 8 large red potatoes (unpeeled) instead of the yukon gold. Also, I added 6 cloves of garlic to the potatoes while they cooked.  Thank you for sharing!"
133174,135470,4/4/2010,5,"Really delicious and creamy.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes along with dried herbs.  I loved the rich taste that the buttermilk provided without a lot of added fat.  This was served with fried chicken, peas and sourdough biscuits for a delicious  Easter feast."
242584,135470,7/5/2011,5,"Wonderful recipe, I always make these potatoes when I make recipe 132130 Easy Low Fat Chicken Souvlaki due to the fact I only have buttermilk on hand for this chicken. Fantastic flavors that my family always looks forward to. Thank you so much Parsley for this keeper!"
2001409066,143278,4/15/2017,0,This is a lovely drink. It is the first drink my now husband of 39 years ever bought me. This was in 1976 so it is an old recipe - and still a good one.
101732,148490,7/3/2006,3,"I LOVE heath bars...let me start with that. I had a few problems with this recipe. It didn't say what size baking sheet to use so I used my medium size one...should have used small as it didn't use all of the space. Next, all of the butter would not blend so I have a puddle of butter in the corner of my pan. It's kind of oily.Lastly,my chocolate won't get hard. It's still gooey and I made it 6 hours ago. I used parchment paper on my sheet to lift it off of the pan easily.I followed the recipe perfectly but it just didn't work for me. Thanks for the try."
735537,148490,1/21/2008,4,Was very good but I used 1 11.5 oz package of Milk Chocolate chips instead of the Hershey Bars. I used a medium pan and the candy did not fill up the pan but that was ok.
131126,171619,6/19/2006,5,"Really nice salad and very colorful.  I omitted the mint as I don't care for it.  I added an extra cucumber, more onion,  and  cut the red pepper into strips. I found there was plenty of dressing for the additions.  Thank you Sharon! "
415204,86006,1/30/2007,4,Just great..easy and goes great with fish..Thanks
865936,171619,3/19/2012,5,This was a very tasty salad.  I really enjoyed the smoothness of the dressing and the colorfulness.
179133,171619,6/23/2013,5,"Very tasty salad. I used orange bell pepper (cut into thin strips), green onion (what I had on hand), and no cilantro (added a little extra parsley in its place). Thanks for sharing!"
349587,187205,9/21/2006,4,.
377581,193654,3/17/2008,5,This is a wonderful casserole! We all loved it! I used leftover turkey and the cream of celery soup. It was an easy dish to prepare. It's full of flavor and really creamy. Thanks! I'll definitley use this recipe again!
107135,193654,4/30/2009,5,"my recipe  that was from a 1960 cookbook here in ne called for 2  pacages of frozen vegtbles   , good easy recipe"
1346217,193654,12/14/2011,5,"This recipe is always a big hit with my family.  I've made it several times.  La Choy's crispy rice noodles can be subsituted for the FF onion rings for the final topping, but it is great either way.  Thanks littleturtle for this recipe."
728767,193689,2/11/2008,2,"This was okay, I guess I was hopeing for more flavor from the margarita mix.I even marinate all day."
990216,193689,3/17/2009,5,"i made this recipe and it's awesome! i used 3 cups  margarita mix, 1/4 tequila and minced garlic and salt to taste and left it for 3 hours, put black pepper. serve with mexican rice, chilis black beans sour cream, pico de gallo and shredded lettuce  it came so good just like chilis"
1309095,193689,6/30/2010,4,"I made this for when friends came over. It was a big hit, they got the recipe so they can make it."
1219772,193689,10/17/2010,0,"This chicken has more flavor than the chicken served at Chili's. We marinated for 3 hours instead of 2 hours. We used light Margarita mix as well (only 5 calories per cup). We served with Lipton's Knorr Fiesta Sides ""Spanish Rice"", a can of black beans mixed with 1/4 cup of medium Picante sauce, and 1 tablespoon of store-bought pico de gallo for garnish. After running the numbers, the whole meal was only about 7 weight watchers points per serving. Very delicious, and awfully healthy, too! Will most definitely make again :)."
1857761,193689,3/18/2011,5,awesome!! i made this recipe with tenderloins and loaded mash =DD
1959593,193689,7/17/2011,0,I had this 1st time. it was awesome will be sure to have it again.. real-good.
1802082984,193689,1/8/2014,4,"I marinated the chicken all night in dailys margarita liquid mix. &lt;br/&gt;I cooked the chicken the next day, it tasted exactly like the mix. &lt;br/&gt;It was very flavorful. However I wasn&#039;t sure how good it would taste with spanish rice and the homemade Pico De Gallo I made because it was very sweet like the margarita mix. &lt;br/&gt;But once I put it all together it tasted really good. I didn&#039;t like it as much plain when I sampled a little taste. But it&#039;s not meant to be plain so that didn&#039;t bother me much. Husband loved it though and I enjoyed it myself :)&lt;br/&gt;I used the Knorr spanish rice and didn&#039;t include any black beans because i&#039;m not a big bean person."
2002287534,193689,9/29/2018,5,This is awesome. Made homemade Pico de Gallo. Put on top of spaNish rice and black beans. So good. I like some sliced avacado with mine. You must try it. So easy to make.
336058,208041,2/25/2007,5,"Very similar to my Green Beans Rhinelander, except for the added blue cheese.  I love sweet and sour beans and the blue cheese gave it a different flavor."
447891,211997,3/8/2007,4,Wonderful stuff on a wintery day! I added about 1/4 tsp of ground cumin as well. Recommended!
169430,211997,6/10/2007,5,"Simply delicious. Everything comes together beautifully to create a richly flavored and healthy soup. The late addition of lemon juice add a vibrant touch that is not to be missed. I didn't have fresh parsley or cilantro and had to use dried but it still turned out great. Thanks Kumquat for a high fiber, low fat and oh so tasty meal. This is a recipe that I'll absolutely use again"
278516,211997,7/17/2007,4,"Hearty stuff!
I used crushed chili instead of pepper sauce and canned lentils to reduce the total cooking time.
I tasted it & thought it was lacking something, then i read The other reviews & followed chefDYC's advice and added ground cumin aswell as a couple of dashes of paprika....
Beautiful!!"
486725,211997,9/16/2007,4,"Yummy stew! I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion to add paprika and cumin. I made half a recipe, and just used the full can of beans and tomatoes, since that was more convenient. To counter balance that, I increased the celery (to 2 ribs) and the pasta (to 3/4 cup). I also used olive oil and skipped the flour part. Delicious!"
177440,211997,10/5/2007,5,"This was a great soup. I only made a few small modifications. I didn't have fresh parsley or cilantro; I used dried parsley instead. Fresh would have been better but not crucial. I didn't have any pasta so I used rice, worked quite well. I omitted the saffron, not sure if it would have been better. I also added 1/2t of cumin. This was a great recipe and I think that it would have been great just as written too."
651118,211997,4/1/2008,5,"Mmm, so good. I also added the cumin and paprika. Didn't have any fresh cilantro or parsley either and I agree with Rose M- would have been better, but it was fine without. To save time I did all of the chopping and as much prep. stuff as I could the night before and it came together in about 45 min. The only thing was that there wasn't much pasta in comparison. I would add about twice as much next time- just my opinion. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you."
621626,211997,6/11/2008,5,This stew was very delicious. I added some bite-size pieces of beef to the soup & left out the celery. I just realized that I also left out the vermicelli but I am sure it would have been better with it. I will have to make it again just to make sure. ;) Thanks Kumquat
353313,211997,3/11/2010,5,Love this!!! I like using thicker vermicelli. mmm!
1496787,211997,3/29/2010,5,My husband loved this! Great flavor and tons of fiber- Mmmm!
28177,211997,6/11/2010,5,"I LOVED this!  DS, who's getting burned out on chickpeas lately, even had 3 helpings!  It was very hearty and super easy to make too. I made it just as directed except I didn't have brown lentils on hand so I used green.  For the small pasta I had Acini di Pepe.  The flavor is terrific, it's healthy & my family particularly appreciated the stew-like consistency rather than soup.  I'll be keeping this one handy & making it again.  Thanks, Kumsie!  Made & enjoyed for ZWT-6 Team Xtra Hot Dishes! :D"
464080,211997,6/14/2010,5,"This is fantastic!!  I didn't have to add any thickener at the end. . .I actually had to add extra crushed tomatoes and broth to thin it out a bit.  I may have added too much pasta, but it was great.  I did cut the recipe in half which was still quite a lot.  I gave it an extra dash of cinnamon in the end, but I was SO happy with the results of this ""soup"".  Made for ZWT6, Team SSaSSy.  I would take a pic, but Tink's is just way too perfect!"
866298,211997,7/17/2010,4,"this was good, I do plan on making this again but not often, my family didnt seem to enjoy it as well as i did. thanks for sharing."
91392,211997,1/18/2011,5,"Just saw this, went in the kitchen and made it.  Cut the amount of cinammon a bit.  Fast, easy and inexpensive to make.  I had some chicken breast that I chopped up and tossed in too because I didn't care if it was vegetarian or not.  Will certainly make again."
1798426,211997,1/18/2011,4,"This is a relatively easy recipe to make. Very satisfying, healthy food."
1604084,211997,1/19/2011,4,"This was not as good as I had hoped.  I gave it more stars than I would have, except that this was my first dish made with saffron, and that could very well have been the problem.  Perhaps I simply do not like saffron, and I would not want to ruin a rating just for personal preference.  I normally adore lentils and chickpeas, so I had high hopes.  Perhaps I will try it again without the saffron, and re rate it then..."
1436075,211997,2/4/2011,5,Loved this soup! I didn't use the saffron or fresh herbs. I ate leftovers at work for two days and my coworker wanted the recipe because it smelled so good. She made it that night and agreed it was fantastic. We both thought the lemon juice really brought the flavors of the soup together. Will definitely be making this again!
452355,211997,2/24/2011,4,"I made this soup and liked, but did not love it.  It is easy to make, so do not be deterred by the long ingredient list.  I did not make any modifications to the recipe.  This makes quite a bit of soup so there will be plenty for leftovers.  Thanks for a warming lunch!"
432411,211997,3/4/2011,5,"Yum, yum, yum!  Loved it.  Didn't have the saffron but turned out wonderful."
469903,211997,3/6/2011,5,This is the best thing I have made all year! Love the unique spiciness in this dish. Leftovers were also fantastic.
706608,211997,3/16/2011,3,"This was good. Easily made vegan by replacing the butter with EVOO. I like a thick soup, so I left out the water, and mixed the flour with 1/2 cup of the hot broth. Used the orzo, otherwise followed to a T. Surprisingly we found the lemon juice rather overpowering. Confusing given the small amount! I would cut it back to half, taste it and then add to your liking. On the other hand I'm sure it will all meld over night and it won't be as strong as leftovers tomorrow. Nice fiber and protein punch here. very filling meal!"
143001,211997,2/4/2013,5,Delicious recipe!  The flavorings set this soup apart from most  lentil soup recipes. Also I liked the idea of adding in the small pasta. Thank you Kumquat.  I tried to give this 5 stars<br/>but the stars keep clearing.
2693387,211997,2/26/2013,5,Just made this today and it is excellent!  I followed the recipe except I added the 1/4 tsp cumin as suggested on earlier reviews and instead of using the flour/water mixture as a thickener I added 1/2 a roasted eggplant (leftover from dinner last night) which I think added depth and worked to thicken without a roux.    Also for the pasta I used a whole wheat Acini di Pepe.  I will definitely be making this again!
2000556181,211997,12/4/2015,5,I made this soup for a Moroccan themed dinner and all the guests loved it. I didn&#039;t have an vermicelli so i used pad thai noodles and they turned out great. I did add some cumin to the dish and used canned lentils. I will definitely make this again!
2001204596,211997,10/13/2016,5,This tasted great! My saucepan was not big enough so I made the recipe with a little less broth and onions. Used fresh ginger and a Serrano pepper instead of ground ginger and hot sauce. No saffron. All organic ingredients. Delightful for a first Moroccan dish to get used to the flavors.
422893,316713,4/1/2010,5,"I really enjoyed this one, the texture once cooked was almost cake-like not dry like some other baked oatmeals I've tried..I used golden syrup in place of honey. Thanks for posting!"
547437,317465,9/5/2008,5,We loved this recipe.  I had to use canned chicken the first time and it was still wonderful.
293901,363403,2/5/2011,5,"This is a really good and easy recipe for the slow cooker.  I had 2 3/4 lb of pork tenderloin which I seasoned with salt & pepper and a turkey rub.  I put sliced carrots, a parsnip and a small sliced onion on the bottom of crock then the pork (whole) on top.  I mixed 1 can of whole canberry sauce, the orange juce and rest of ingredients on top and cooked for 1 hr on high and 6 hrs on low.  It was so tender and delicious.  Thank you for posting."
226863,429550,6/26/2010,5,"Great twist on the usual tomato drink....a bloody mary.  This is very enjoyable.  It's miserably hot here, so I didn't try it hot.  But its good cold! Thanks for sharing."
280271,429550,8/25/2010,3,"I love Bloody Mary's and Margarita's but this just didn't really do it for me. I guess I'm just not crazy about tequila in tomato juice. It was really powerful. 2 oz of alcohol with 1/3 cup of tomato juice about 3 oz. I ended up adding another 3 oz of tomato juice just to make it more drinkable, and I still could not drink all of it. It was really easy to prepare and sure did look pretty. :)"
17803,44829,11/28/2002,5,This is a very nice drink to finish up your holiday dinner with.  Very easy to put together.  I used Lite Cool Whip and as rich as this drink is we could not tell it. Everyone loved this punch.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.
63358,44829,12/5/2002,5,Absolutely wonderful recipe!  It was definately a hit....
408099,44829,12/20/2006,5,Great punch! It was a big hit at our office party.
1072593,73272,6/5/2012,5,"Made with g'babe and suddenly I got that grandmotherly urge to threaten that I hope I'm around when he has kids.  Well, we both lived to tell about it...and enjoy it.  Made for My 3 Chefs."
1072593,103331,9/8/2015,5,"Two hours after imbibing, I finally found my brain.  I was covered in blue cheese dip and demanding another margarita.  What???  It might have happened...might have not..but MIGHT have!"
148715,136376,6/1/2007,2,"the onion did not add a very nice flavor but if the chicken is baked with some bacon, and cheese on top the recipe is still good."
211184,173930,9/15/2007,5,*Made for PAC Fall 2007* These muffins are so easy to prepare and are delicious. I am thinking they would be great alongside a nice spaghetti dinner or tucked into a lunch box. I used 1/2 package of JD Hot Sausage and I did get exactly 16 muffins. Thanks for sharing. Nick's Mom
49879,173930,10/7/2007,5,Yummm.  I am eating one right now.  I used Bob Evans Hot sausage. The only thing I would change would be DO NOT WAIT 30 minutes to eat!!
339260,173930,4/20/2008,5,"I used chorizo in place of the sweet Italian sausage.  I also added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  As stated, the batter is very thick which made it easy to put into the muffin tins.  I sprinkled some additional parmesan cheese on top of the muffins before putting them in the oven.  The aroma coming from the muffins as they were cooking was wonderful.  It almost smelled like I had a pizza baking in the oven.  The muffins were delicious.  I really liked the spiciness.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.  Made for PAC Spring, 2008."
510313,173930,6/27/2008,5,Made & reviewed for ZWT 4 - Kumquat's Kookin' Kaboodles! I used Merguez sausage for these muffins & I think it worked really well. I made the full batch (16) & they disappeared extremely quick lol. The whole family really enjoyed these & the last few were finished for breakfast! Thanks Michelle for a yummy recipe :)
959535,173930,12/19/2008,4,"These were super, super awesome.  I substituted half a pound of venison sausage (10% beef fat) and homemade marinara.  They froze really well, I just throw a couple in with a light salad for my husband in the morning and by lunchtime they were thawed and perfect!  Thanks a bunch for this recipe!"
130819,176690,11/10/2006,5,"Makes for wonderful Buttermilk Pancakes!It's one of those old fashioned recipes that has everyone coming back for seconds - luckily I had already suspected that it was going to be a thumbs up and doubled the recipe. I made as posted and am sure beating the eggs made those pancakes really special. Thank you Silent Rain, it's a keeper. "
424680,176690,10/2/2008,5,"Always interested in trying a new pancake recipe, & when someone like Gerry recommends it, well, I'm all for it! Absolutely right, THESE ARE WONDERFUL PANCAKES, & I liked the addition of the brown sugar (& I used dark brown instead of the light)! Will be making these again! [Tagged, made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in the current Pick-A-Chef]"
286566,176690,6/5/2011,4,"My only issue was that the mix was so thick and when I cooked the first pancake I knew it would be a case of burnt on the outside to cook the inside so added about another 1/4 cup of buttermilk and voila could scoop into th pan and swirl and get some lovely pancakes and got 15 in total though think mine were a little less than 4 inches but were thoroughly enjoyed, the DH had his with sugar and lemon juice, the DM and DS as is and I had mine with a drizzle of sugar free maple syrup, yum, thank you Silent Rain for a lovely recipe and Sydney Mike for his recommendation, made for I Recoomend Tag Game."
60231,194492,11/16/2006,4,"I like the idea of these, but I think if I make them again, I'll make a few changes - more blueberries and definitely less salt and possible some cinnamon in the batter. These turned out too salty tasting to me with distracted from the blueberry taste. Otherwise I like the idea of this dessert and will probably try it again in the future.
Thanks."

I usually double the recipe and use fresh carrots instead of frozen (just because I don&#039;t have them!).  It turns out great every time.  I will vary the sausage - sometimes sweet Italian, sometimes kilbasa or smokes sausages.  We like it best with an Italian sausage of some time.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!"

865936,317280,3/25/2009,4,"Your kids will love this!  This tasted a lot like the store bought sauce, but it is made with ingredients you probably have and is so easy to make.  I didn't time how long I cooked it, I just turned it off when it got to the desired consistency.  Made for PAC Spring 2009."
114027,317280,4/13/2009,4,"Very good sloppy jo mix. Easy to make and I always have the ingredients on hand! I served some over hot dogs to make sloppy dogs, which was really yummy! Thanks for posting, made for I Recommend Tag Game."
204024,317280,3/14/2011,4,Everyone loves sloppy joes and it is a great thing to make for a quick dinner.  My sauce was a little too thick to start so I added an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce and it made it thin enough to simmer a little while.  Made for PAC 2011 Spring.
1072593,418446,12/20/2011,5,Lots of leftovers...enough to feed the homeless.

6357,17099,4/1/2003,5,"This is Delish! Thanks for posting- I did slightly alter the procedure of making this. After mixing everything together, I applied a little margarine on my palm and then mixed everything well with my hand. Then, I shaped the mixture into small round balls and I christened them ""Chocolate Ladoos""! Then, I stored these in my refrigerator until it was time to serve. These made an awesome treat for my April Fools party today at lunch:)"
75846,75755,12/13/2003,5,"Well, I must say I know better.  These should not be used for roll cookies, but I just had to try because it was Mean's recipe.  The dough will be too soft, and has too much ""spread"" when baked.  The cookies themselves are delish!! Easy to put together, and pretty on the plate with the sugar baked on as called for.  We also had some really fat Santa shapes that were pretty yummie too!"
50445,75755,12/15/2003,5,"This dough if very easy to prepare and very easy to work with.  The cookies are soft and chewy, even though they are very thin.  In fact, that is my only complaint, I searched for a ""cut"" crystal glass to flatten then, putting a beautiful design in them, and the design baked out when the cookie flattened.  But it doesn't matter in my family, they prefer taste over presentation, and these are a delicious butter cookie.  Thanks Meanie!!!"
72489,75755,12/20/2003,2,These cookies had no lemon taste at all.  I even increased the lemon juice to 5 Tablespoons and they still had no lemon flavor.  Maybe the Chef can enlighten me as to how to make these cookies taste like lemon.
58852,75755,7/1/2006,5,"I think these are pretty good,although I used lemon extract to give them a more lemony flavor.  Also, I used some shortening in place of some of the butter because I ran out!  Turned out great though. I think the sour cream is a good addition.  Makes them soft and yummy!"
145352,75755,9/10/2007,5,"Oh these are so very good!!!! To emphasize the lemon flavor, I added about 1 teaspoon of grated lemon zest with the lemon juice. They have a nice, not over-powering, lemon flavor!!! The first tray I did were puffed up, but the later cookies were a little flatter. Next time I will put the dough in the refrigerator after each tray so the dough will stay chilled.
Loved them!!!!"
383346,75755,11/2/2007,4,These cookies are good but they don't taste a lot lemon (I know it's supposed to be VERY subtle).  I should have read the comment and add lemon zest or lemon extract.  They're easy to do.  Thanks Color Guard Mom :)  Made for Potluck tag.
67656,75755,11/27/2007,4,"Following Charmie's comments I added about a teaspoon of lemon zest to my dough and thought it was perfect; bright and lemony but still mild enough to be a fairly neutral cookie.  Let my dough chill overnight as I was considering using these as as rolled cookie.  Much to my surprise my first batch was well overcooked at 9 minutes and I found with my 4 inch snowflakes 7 minutes was just right. the consistency on the cookie was good, a little crispy but tender rather than pillowy and soft, but I found them to be a bit oily.  I think next time I will add and extra tablespoon or two of flower.  Thanks!"
17803,75755,3/1/2008,5,"I don't know which is better the dough or the cookie!!  LOL  I told Color Guard Mom that I was going to have to hide the dough from my kids.   I was right, they took one taste and I had to put a chain and lock on the refrigerator door.  The one thing nice about the kids getting into the dough is that there are no eggs in this recipe to worry about.I used a fresh lemon and then added some zest as some of the other reviewers did.   Made for *Potluck Tag* game 2008 for Dreamer's 'Let's Take Our Dogs for a Hike' party"
37636,75755,5/6/2008,5,"Delicious cookies! They turned out crispy around the edges and slightly chewy in the centers. I used lemon extract, which gave them a nice zippy lemony flavor. Also used pastel colored sugar to roll them in, which reinforced the fresh, summery character of these cookies.
Thanks for posting,
~Sue"
506626,75755,5/8/2008,5,Absolutely delicious!  Just took first batch out of the oven and couldnt wait to try it.  Absolutely wonderful.  I used the juice of one large lemon and the zest on the lemon to give that extra zip.
779699,75755,11/16/2009,5,"These were great! I followed the recipe exactly because I wanted a very light lemon taste, just a whisper of lemon. These turned out perfect, cripsy but not too crispy and still a little chewy! We gave half a batch to some friends who recently had a loss in their family and they loved them as well! Thanks for posting! Made for Holiday Tag November 2009!"
668205,176778,12/13/2007,4,"This is a very tasty, light coleslaw. I substituted ram rau for mint leaves. Thanks you for the recipe."
59780,243349,8/24/2007,5,"Great use of contest ingredients! I made this as directed, but using fresh jalapenos and using only 1 tsp because I am a wimp. I still found it too spicy, but I cooled it down with a bit of sour cream on top. I wanted to freeze some of the leftovers just to see if they would freeze well, but there wasn't any left! Good Luck!"
337963,243349,5/30/2008,5,"Wow, this was delicious!  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!  Edited to say that I made this again using nonfat evaporated milk to lighten it up and it was just as good.  Thanks sis!"
491437,243349,10/27/2008,5,"A delicious way to get your veggies!  The spice is warming, perfect for chilly fall."
246266,243349,7/2/2009,4,"Nice soup.  I used roasted anaheim peppers instead of jalapenos.  (That's just what I had fresh from the garden.)  I left out the nutmeg as a personal preference.  Unfortunately, the rest of my household isn't as keen on veggies as I am, so it looks like I'll be eatin' a lot of soup!  I may try to freeze some.  I did add a bit of chipotle to a small portion, and that was an enjoyable variation of this.  Some fresh cilantro and maybe a bit of sour cream added to the chipotle version might be nice, too; although, I didn't try it that way.  Just thinking of ideas, since I have so much of this left over!"
1346772,263228,10/24/2009,5,Awesome BBQ sauce.  I made pulled pork and got rave reviews.  Just like Montana's BBQ sauce.
365191,263228,2/9/2013,2,"I hate to leave a negative review, but as written, I feel a two-star review is generous. The recipe is EXTREMELY sweet, and believe me, I love a good, sticky, sweet barbecue sauce - this is really more of a chutney than a barbecue sauce. It didn't taste BAD (although it is quite onion-heavy), but it isn't reminiscent of barbecue sauce at all, so I found the title misleading. The yield is also off - you won't get more than 1 1/2 cups of sauce/chutney from the recipe as written. I loved that the apple flavor really came through, though, and will likely use this again, but with the variations I used today in order to turn it into a truer barbecue sauce: omit the brown sugar (the apple butter is plenty sweet), add 4 ounces tomato paste, 6 ounces water, additional salt to taste, and at least another 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar. You could probably also omit the ketchup to further reduce the sweetness, since the apple butter already carries many of the same spices."
9199069,263228,8/18/2014,4,this is very good and as for some people . We find the area you are living in could change any taste problems . making changes may help you or just make your Carolina sauce. no one told people not to add or subtract items to fit taste.i am sure  no one is holding a gun to your head.
45208145,263228,9/10/2014,0,i&#039;ve made this a few times and we all thought it was delicious.  will definitely hang on to this recipe!  thank you!
2001228957,263228,11/1/2016,5,Decided to make this after hubby want to buy an exorbitantly priced jar of apple butter BBQ sauce at a local apple orchard. It is delicious. I ended up doubling recipe it was that good. I did however cut the amount of onion in half after reading another review about the onion flavor. 1/2 cup onion is perfect. I used my own apple butter and because that is sweet on its own I added the brown sugar slowly to taste. I only used a packed 1/4 cup brown sugar and it is just right for us! Don't skip the cider vinegar it is. Nice touch! Will definitely try this again but make enough to can. I will pressure can @ 11lbs pressure for 30 min. because I'm not sure of the safety of waterbathing not knowing the acidity of the sauce. I'll update my review after seeing how it comes out after pressure canning it! Don't hesitate to try this adjusting onion and sugar to your taste.
1742738,263228,12/4/2017,5,I have made twice and will now will keep a big bottle in the fridge. It has passed the test of being in our family rotation. Never thought we would have a sweet sauce in our home but a smoky addition proved me wrong.
280271,347609,3/1/2009,5,2/27/09 Wow! This is packed full of yummy flavors. With each bite you get a burst of different textures and flavors. We really enjoyed this. I cut the recipe in half and there is at least enough to serve 6 people. Thanks for posting. :) 3/1/09 Just a quick update. DH and I have been enjoying leftovers for the last two days and they are great COLD.
256795,347609,10/25/2009,5,"This is yummy!  I added extra home-grown tomatoes, capers, and sun-dried tomatoes.  I also used whole wheat pasta.  Thanks so much for sharing!  :O)"
192581,347609,2/11/2010,5,"With these ingredients, there's nothing not to like about this!  It's important to use the best quality sundried tomatoes in all your recipes.  I don't think I made any changes at all to this, except I had to leave out basil for my BF (but of course I added it to mine).  I had leftovers for lunch.  Thank you :)"
115920,53913,3/25/2004,5,"This is a really easy and tasty recipe I originally got from the Campbell's soup website.  It's a hit with the whole family!  The only changes I usually make is using whole wheat tortillas, and I puree the picante sauce because I don't like the tomatoes and onions to be ""chunky"".  All in all, a family favorite!"
2551291,401799,1/6/2013,5,"I have been making this dessert for years now after I first discovered the recipe for it in the Women's Weekly recipe card library.  Although it can be a bit demanding timewise, due to the fact that you have to wait for each layer to freeze before completing the next, it is well worth the effort.  As I do not particularly like glaced fruit I tend to chop up a couple of cherry ripes and use them instead along with the toasted almonds.  It is so delicious that rarely does it last very long in my freezer!"
579298,415875,3/30/2010,5,"This recipe is definitely going into our repertoire! The dish was inextricably easy and delicious! We used almond milk, rather than rice or soy. I was a little worried about the nuttiness of the almond milk being an issue, but it melded with the flavors perfectly. Laura, you were right, it does seem a little odd as the process unravels, but the outcome is nothing short of amazing! Made for PAC Spring 2010 :)"
591927,415875,9/14/2010,4,"Very easy and came together quickly.  My very, very picky 3 year old gobbled it down and had seconds - woah!!  I think the chicken stock used may be why this didn't turn out to be 5 stars.  Will try different brand next time. Still very good."
1535969,415875,11/16/2011,1,This was awful! Had to throw whole thing out. Flavour was good but the texture horrible. The ripped up fajitas were extremely soggy. There was way too much liquid. Tried to cook longer but never thicken and was just a sloppy mess.
26451,415875,11/26/2012,5,"This was fantastic!!  I'm a non food allergy parent of a child with milk (and possibly gluten) allergies.  It is extremely difficult to find great tasting meals that I enjoy which he can eat.  This is definitely going to be in my standard line up!<br/>I followed the recipe almost exactly.  My only change was to use a can of cilantro lime Rotel in place of the tomatoes.  I also think that I used more chicken than was called for, about 3 cups chopped.<br/>I thought I would need to add cheese to mine when I pulled it out of the oven, but I'm glad that I didn't!  It thickened well and had a nice balance of flavor.  It was a little spicy due to the Rotel, but overall an amazing entree."
2001602135,415875,6/27/2017,0,"This looks amazing. I did notice a discrepancy. In the ingredients list it calls for 1/2 cup of water and 2 cups of chicken broth. There is no mention of the broth in the directions. This was likely the cause of the sloppiness mentioned by the other reviewer nataliehoy. I do believe I will add more chicken and reduce the liquids for a bit longer. For my hoard, I will have to at least double the recipe. It seems like a fairly forgiving combination. Thanks for sharing!"
323186,424541,10/26/2011,5,"This was a very simple recipe to follow, I may have been a little generous with the garlic and curry powder (I used a Roasted Garam Masala) so mine was quite hot, but I do like it like that!    carefully judged when to add the prawns,   and found this a really nice supper dish that I will definitely enjoy again.    Thanks Jackie, made for PRMR recipe tag game."
1802940343,424541,7/17/2014,5,"Very nice, I added more garlic we like that out here after all it&#039;s garlic fest time in Gilroy and as a twist served with slices of lime."
2001329213,424541,12/31/2016,5,"This recipe is a real hit in our family. After Ive tried it the first time few years ago, we've done it maybe a dozen times."
343262,17050,4/25/2007,5,"Took this to a pot luck, easy to make and very tasty. I used low fat non dairy topping, a little extra pineapple and a large banana to make a little extra."
6357,42898,11/2/2002,5,"Excellent! I made this this evening as a part of our Dhanteras festival appetiser party celebration and also mom's bday that's today:)
I added 1/4 tsp. red chilli powder, used a little more than 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. black pepper in addition to all the other spices mentioned. Instead of baking my potato, I first peeled it, then cut it into dices and boiled it in plenty of water till it was tender and broke easily with a fork/knife. I used 1 small onion instead of just 1/2. We make these patties often on rainy days and enjoy these with tea back home in India. Normally, use of cardamom powder in these is unheard of, but, I enjoyed it! I don't recall using curry powder as well in preparing these patties, but from now on, I will:)
These made 7 patties for me. These go well with tomato ketchup also in case one doesn't have a yogurt sauce/ plain yogurt on hand. 
How about trying this next time: After you make the patties, take a slice of bread. Put a leaf of iceberg lettuce on it. Add some tomato ketchup on top. Place a single chickpea cake on the ketchup. Pour some ketchup on top(My bro. suggests pouring some Thousand Island dressing here). Top with another slice of bread. Chow down your potatoey burger in style! Enjoy! :)
Enjoy! "
277102,42898,12/24/2005,5,Delicious and easy - check these out if you love chickpeas and/or potatoes.
17803,53913,6/13/2003,5,"While you know it has to be good when your picky DD gave me her blessing to make this one again!!  So easy to make and I always have these ingredients on hand.  I used a round two quart baking dish so I baked at 425 degrees for 10 minutes then the last 20 at 400 degrees.  The center was a bit cooler ,but still warm, so next time I'll leave in an extra 5 minutes or so.  I did use a some no stick spray in the baking dish.  Thanks for a great recipe Charlene!  "
2002192418,203255,6/20/2018,0,i did not like it. not enough flavor
47175,53913,3/30/2004,5,"This was very good!  This tasted like another dish I make, but this was soooo much easier!! I only used about 3 tortilla's as they were pretty big and I used ground turkey.  Next time I might add some corn and/or black olives to sneak a veggie in!"
99624,53913,4/19/2004,5,"I tore this out of a magazine several years ago & somewhere along the way managed to lose it. Only difference is I use corn tortillas. It's a quick & easy dish that tastes great. Thanks for posting it Charlene, now I can quit digging for it."
60989,53913,5/10/2004,5,"This was great. My 10YO son made this for his night of making dinner, and it was easy enough for him. The best thing is, it tastes good enough for me too! The outer tortillas because slightly crisp while the ones on the inside become nice and moist and seem to soak up the salsa flavor. We had this on a bed of shredded lettuce with some tomatoes sprinkled on top. We also scooped it up with tortilla chips. It was great either way. And the leftovers are going to be a terrific taco salad for lunch tomorrow. Thanks for sharing!"
53368,53913,5/22/2004,2,"While very easy to make, it was unfortunate that no one in my family liked it.  The salsa was just too overpowering and the flavor, all in all, was bland.  Sorry."
173274,53913,12/2/2004,4,"Where do I begin?  I found this recipe by doing a search for “condensed tomato soup” as an ingredient (I had bought quite a few cans due to a grocery-store special, and was looking for ways to get rid of them…).  My husband loves spicy foods, typically Mexican, so I thought I’d give this a try.  I did do quite a few modifications.  The original recipe looked a bit bland (confirmed so by one of the other reviewers).  So I spiced it up a bit.  First, during the browning of the beef (Step 1), I added ½ cup chopped onion, 1 can (drained) of black beans, and 1 small can (drained and chopped) green chilies (there were about 3 whole chilies).  Of course, I then drained the beef mixture, to get rid of the excess fat.  Then, during Step 2, I did it a bit differently.  I mixed together the ½ cup of milk and the condensed soup.  Then, I added some Chile Powder and a little bit of hot sauce (you should do this to taste, depending how spicy you like it) to the soup/milk mixture.  I added that to the beef mixture.  Then, I followed the recipe as is (adding the salsa, tortillas, ½ the cheese, etc).  This was a wonderful dish.  My hubby confirmed by going back for seconds!  I rated this recipe only 4 stars (as opposed to 5 stars) because I did have to think up the modifications."
196156,53913,2/21/2005,5,I got this recipe from Campbells and have been making it for years. It is very easy and quite tasty. A good recipe for those days when you need a meal but dont want to spend a lot of time. 
180879,53913,5/5/2005,4,"Most at my house liked it. But I did use some of the suggestions of other reviewers. I added green chili's, taco seasoning (instead of chili powder), onions, corn. Next time I may spice it up more. Hubby & 2 kids liked it but me and 1 kid did not really love it. Mabye I'll try corn tortillas next time."
278113,53913,1/18/2006,5,"Another family favorite here, so easy and so delish! Thanks for sharing!"
206101,53913,1/4/2008,5,We enjoyed this! Thank you!
1844337,53913,1/2/2014,4,"This dish is great if you&#039;re feeding a family. For just me &amp; DH making tacos or burritos is more simple. I added taco seasoning, 1/2 onion, used rotel instead of salsa &amp; used fritos instead of tortillas. It&#039;s a good meal &amp; there are so many different things you could do with this (add corn &amp; black beans, serve over lettuce, add sour cream, spice it up, etc...)"
41809,56936,11/23/2003,5,"I love this easy Parmesan Chicken recipe!  Tossed it together, stuck it in the oven, and voila!
It's great cause I always have the needed ingredients on hand...
Thanks, Barb...This one is definitely a keeper!
Laudee"
9869,56936,10/25/2004,5,"So easy so tasty, instead of chicken breasts I used boneless thighs.
I will defintely make this again."
184723,56936,4/4/2005,5,This was super good!!!  We made it with Onion Flavored Rice (mix) #14828.  It turned out wonderful.  We also topped it all with shredded parmesan and green onions after taking it out of the onion.  SO moist!!! Thanks!
89240,59038,11/29/2004,5,"This came out great despite my changes. I made it crustless, and used stevia powder and splenda instead of the sugar. Will make this again, soon."
232047,59038,1/5/2009,5,Very good!  I think it's best if served from a frozen state.  I kept it refrigerated and the filling started to lose it's form after it was on the table for a while.  The second one I made I kept frozen and never had a problem with it losing form.
179095,105645,12/22/2004,5,This recipe is great. I made it for a staff potluck and everyone loved it! I think next time I will add a bit more cream cheese and I definately recommend using 2 cans of filling.  
347246,105645,9/21/2006,5,"yes, this is awsome!
I made it for my nightly dessert.
I only made one serving, and saved the rest of the ingredients for next time!
I used fat free cream cheese and cool whip free, I even put sprinkles on top and a pinch of cinnamon. YUMMY!!"
455539,105645,6/24/2007,5,"Made this twice now.  
The first time as written except for using all low cal and fat free items-perfect and yummy! 
Only 313 calories and ZERO fat!
But when I went to make it yesterday, I found my fat-free cream cheese to be expired and it looked questionable anyway.  So I improvised and used a cup of Dannon Light n Lively Vanilla Yogurt in its place. (Don't even ask me how I got creative enough to try this...but it was superb!) Plus it acually shaved off about 15 MORE calories per serving. 
Don't hesitate to try this version."
174991,105645,12/21/2007,5,I had 6 individual angel food cakes that I used and instead of cherry pie filling I used apple( with Splenda) with a touch of cinnamon and chopped walnuts.  The other ingredients  were no fat.  I is nice and light and lends itself to so may different combinations.  I'll use this often.
309526,105645,6/5/2008,5,"How woefully remiss of me to not have rated this wonderful dessert sooner!! I've made it several times already! I did make a change, due to personal preference.  My DH does not like cream cheese, so I used 2 8 oz containers of black cherry yogurt. And do use 2 cans of cherry pie filling as one seemed a little sparse.  Thank you for an awesome dessert!"
507160,146038,10/8/2007,4,Was good and easy to make.  I cooked the chicken and the bacon together to give the chicken more flavor.  It made alot so we had a lot of leftovers even though I cut back on some of the ingredients.
93446,214844,7/9/2007,5,"A very interesting combination of ingredients, yet they work very well together.  This makes enough for two meals for my husband and me.  I made it with baby shells and dry white wine and substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth, since that is what I had on hand.  We can't wait to taste the leftovers!"
213677,234363,10/1/2007,4,"I used brown rice and 2 cups of lettuce seemed like a lot so I just added fresh lettuce until it look about right.
I'm rating this 3.5 stars because of how easy and filling it was. Nice for a quick lunch or side. Made for Pick-a-chef Fall '07"
178427,347153,11/12/2009,5,"The flavor of this stew was outstanding. I didn't have any mushrooms but really didn't miss them. I added corn, peas, carrots,
and celery. this is a real keeper! Thanks for sharing your great recipe."
1269180,353148,6/4/2013,5,"Beautiful vibrant colours (fun!), and the veggies stayed crispy which contrasted perfectly with soft pasta and chicken. Easy to make, tasted great and appealing to our little boy - thanks for this keeper!"
286566,360721,9/10/2013,5,"I scaled this back for 1 serve.  I love cheesy scrambled eggs so added a little extra but the addition of the Dijon mustard and the herbs really made this a great dish and I thoroughly enjoyed with a slice of wholemeal/wholegrain toast for a very filling breakfast, thank you daisygrl64, made for Name that Ingredient tag game."
469903,361164,3/21/2009,5,Really great bread! It went very well with the chili I made yesterday.  Great texture and lightly flavored - easily slices too. I used about 2.5 cups of flour total and used olive oil instead of veg oil. and splenda in place of the sugar. Can't wait to make sandwiches for lunch!
1235705,361164,4/12/2009,5,Awesome bread.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable.  I am now going to attempt this in the bread machine.

573325,443155,12/17/2010,4,"These cookies are very yummy! They have a slightly caramelly flavour from the white chocolate and that goes great with the spices and cranberries.<br/>The oats lend the cookie a crispy texture, which we all enjoyed and the sunflower seeds added great crunch.<br/>I was a little absent minded while scooping the dough onto the cookie sheet and somehow my scoops must have been rather large, cause I ended up with only 7 cookies from half the recipe. Those spread very much during baking, so that I had big coffee shop style cookies. Thats nice, though, too. :)<br/>I prefer these without the glaze as I found they were too sweet with it on top.<br/>Other than that though a lovely little recipe and great for sharing (which I already did).<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing your creation with us and good luck in the contest!"
28177,443155,12/17/2010,3,"I thought the use of contest ingredients was really creative and we looked forward to trying these.  For the most part they're okay, but my family just prefers a softer cookie.  These were quite crumbly, dry and not sweet enough for our taste; even with the drizzle of icing.  I wish we had enjoyed them more, but am really glad we tried them.  Thanks for sharing your creation, chef!  :)  Good luck in the contest!"
323143,21936,11/14/2006,5,"My church was having a Chili contest and I was asked to enter it b/c not many people had entered the contest, so I did. My husband said, have you ever made chili before and I said no and he started laughing. I was looking for a recipe and found this one and made it for the contest and out of 7 entries I won First Place and everyone loved it!!!!!! Great Recipe to make!!!!!!!! "
186855,443155,12/17/2010,4,"These are easy to make and are quite tasty. I made some without the glaze, and found we preferred those.  We thought the glaze made them just a little too sweet for our taste, but they certainly look pretty with it.  After I made the 24 cookies using a 1 teaspoon scoop, I still had plenty of dough left.  I switched to the tablespoon scoop, and got another 24 cookies. :) I liked the larger cookies better.  I know...shouldn't make a difference, but to my warped mind it did.  Made for the 2010 Craze-E Category Contest.  Good luck and thanks for participating."
424680,443155,7/16/2011,5,"Loved these little tasties, especially with the chocolate & cranberry combo, but then that my addictions showing through! I did use a larger scoop than the teaspoon suggested & still got over 2 dozen cookies! They were made mostly for my other half to share at a weekly group, but I kept 4 back for a simple taste test, & yes, I need 4 to make an accurate test! Definitely a nice keeper of a recipe! Thanks for this very nice creation! [Made & reviewed in I Recommend recipe tag]"
220348,445359,10/5/2011,5,"This was really good and full of flavour. The taste was sharp and somewhat of a pick me up, since both the wasabi and radish are strong in flavour. I used mayonnaise because I wanted a non dairy sandwich, and found that the wasabi and mayo go well together."
1072593,462442,11/15/2014,5,Remember that time I ate a whole recipe for Mexican Milanese Style Sandwiches?  Me neither.
198580,21936,4/10/2005,5,"I was skeptical about using canned French Onion soup, but was very pleased with the results of this chili.  I did not have tomato paste, so I used crushed tomatoes w/ puree, and it was great.  I loved the cumin flavor, but did substitute Cayenne pepper for the black pepper, and also added a touch more chili powder as well as a TBS of salt (liquid from the tomatoes probably diluted it a bit).  Keeper recipe.  I'll make this when I don't have 4 hours to simmer my other recipe."
185293,21936,4/20/2005,5,What a nice twist on chili.  I'm going to try the crushed tomatoes next time and maybe a little bit of bell pepper.  I love the french onion soup in it!! Thanks!
246266,21936,10/8/2005,4,"Not bad for something so quick and easy.  I threw this together for my husband to eat while watching football. I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and a 12 oz can of tomato paste instead of using the smaller sized cans that the recipe calls for. And I used a smaller sized can of beans--probably around 15 oz.  I haven't had Wendy's chili in a very long time, so I don't know how this compares, but this is a good, quick chili recipe that I would make again."
160497,21936,9/1/2006,5,"So easy and quick to make!  and tasty too!!!  I used 2 16 oz cans of kidney beans instead of 21 oz, and I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a 16 oz can of diced tomatoes, undrained.  Everyone loved it!  This is my chili recipe from now on!"
173314,21936,9/4/2006,5, First let me say this is a great recipe...most of us sometime tweak things for own preference or with what we have on hand and I did just that. I used 2 lb gr. beef and did not puree the onion soup. instead of kidney beans I used a mix of chili bean and no beans chili. all else same. simmered a while and froze half. served with toasted cheese. thanks for a quick flexible recipe. oh so good!
401101,21936,12/5/2006,5,"A keeper!  Simple ingredients, quick to make, and DELICIOUS.  No need to puree the French onion soup...it all blended together just fine.  Perfect for a chilly December night!  Thanks!  My chili hunt is over."
290985,21936,2/4/2007,5,A very quick and easy recipe.  Also very good!  I did not puree the soup and don't think it made any difference.  I used just 1 pound of ground beef and doubled the amount of beans.  A keeper! Thanks
270401,21936,2/19/2007,5,Wow!  This chili is great!  I wouldn't change a thing!  (I took everyone's advice and didn't puree the onion soup..came out perfect.)  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
54678,21936,3/8/2007,4,we did this recipe along with 2 others and I forgot to write down my comments so reviewing as a tried recipe
441443,21936,3/8/2007,3,"I followed the recipe exactly. It was good and did seem somewhat like Wendy's Chili, but it seemed too thick and too tomato tasting. I believe this was due to the tomato paste. I am going to keep looking at other Wendy's Chili Clone recipes."
65459,21936,9/11/2007,5,I entered in a chili cook-off  with this and won!
559283,21936,10/14/2007,3,The recipe was good but I think it might have been missing some spices. It felt too tomatoey with the tomato paste and didn't have the kick I was expecting from Wendy's.
173880,21936,10/22/2007,4,I used ground turkey but otherwise followed the recipe. I didn't process the onion soup and the whole thing was at a simmer in about 15 minutes. Loved how easy and quick it was to put together. Thanks!
241564,21936,4/13/2009,5,"I entered a chili contest @ my church in 2006 and had never made chili before. So, I went on here to find a recipe and found this one. I looked over the ingredients list and said ok, found one. I made the chili and took it to the contest and won FIRST PLACE!!!!! In 2007 my church had another contest and I had to make my chili again and I won FIRST PLACE AGAIN! This is a GREAT Recipe!!!!!"
724631,21936,6/18/2009,5,"OMG, I am amazed at how good this is, and how easy!  Normally we add more spice, but this was great, I hardly had any leftovers for just the 2 of us.  This is not bland at all, but it doesn't interfere with medication or the like (at this point at least.)  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Tinkerbell!  Made for Photo Tag."
537937,21936,7/6/2009,5,"Oh wow....the family's new favorite chilli recipe.  DH love Wendy's chili and so I just knew this would go over in a big way for him.  I""ve never made chilid using french onion soup and so this must..it just must be the secret ingredient.  I""m not a meat eater, but the smell was heavenly while this was simmering away on the stove-top.  A real keeper Tink.

456158,21936,7/7/2009,5,"Very very very good chili! Not Wendys, but great! I added a can of chili beans as well."
801264,21936,11/21/2009,5,"Not Wendy's chili but good. I believe that Wendy's chili has peppers in it and is a lot more soupy. This chili was thick, more like for topping hot dogs. I added more seasoning and some chicken bullion. This is easy and tasty, its a keeper. Thanks for posting!"
222564,21936,12/3/2011,4,"Tasty chili in a flash. Not a veggie to be peeled and chopped, just open cans. I added like 1/4 cup diced green chilies."
60414,21936,3/29/2013,3,As prepared. I was not impressed.  Bland as is.
125349,75217,11/4/2006,4,"very nice cake. I needed a cake the required no white sugar. I love the crumb layer at the bottom and the buttery flavor to the cake. this was really easy to make, and i'll definitely be using this recipe again. "
52282,83110,5/29/2004,4,"i made this as directed except i substituted shrimp ramen noodles and cooked shrimp for the chicken. i loved the combo of the noodles, fruit, nuts and shrimp. however i found the dressing to be very salty, which is a problem i find in all the seasoning packets with all flavors of ramen noodles. i only used half a packet because of this, but next time i will eliminate it totally and just use a dash of soy sauce instead. i'm attempting to post a photo."
18391,86705,3/22/2004,5,"Excellent doughnuts .. I fried some of them, and my husband liked them better, but the baked ones were great too .. thanks!"
117438,86705,4/25/2004,5,"I can't believe I forgot to review these. It was so easy to make. I used butter instead of shortening, simply my preference. They came out really nice and less greasy that deep fried doughnuts. I used brown sugar in the glaze, which gave them a caramel flavour. I had to give the rest to my parents-in-law, I just couldn't have that kind of temptation in the house. Thanks Vnut, for a great recipe!b  "
317004,313457,7/17/2011,5,"I've made this many times, and it turns out great every time. Thanks for posting!"
164890,86705,4/9/2006,3,"I followed this recipe using 4 and 1/2 cups of flour, I wanted a batter that was almost a dough but scoopable so I could put it into muffin tins.  The dough/batter idea worked very well for me! and I didn't have to bother with rolling out and cutting.  The texture of the doughnuts was not what I expected, a bit drier that I thought.  But the flavor was good, and the icing worked great.  I'm sure it would have tasted better if I dropped the batter from my scoop into a fryer instead of into tins, but that's not what a ""No-fry doughnut"" recipe is about! :)  "
2694065,86705,2/15/2013,5,"Really great easy recipe! Like a previous reviewer, I substituted butter for the shortening, and I also used more flour than the recipe called for to get the dough thick enough that it'd retain the shape of my heart cookie cutter (I made these for Valentine's Day). I skipped the glaze and simply frosted with Nutella and powdered sugar. The doughnuts themselves have a mildly sweet flavor, more like a bread than a doughnut, so I really recommend topping them with a glaze or some type of frosting. They were pleasantly soft and I wouldn't call them moist, but they certainly weren't dry."
75218,92798,6/22/2004,5,VERY SIMPLE...Yet VERY GOOD!!! Thanx for posting!!!
131126,92798,6/23/2004,5,"This was very good for something so simple. I threw in some chopped red bell pepper to add some color
to the recipe, but it would have been great without it."
123865,92798,6/24/2004,5,"Hi, Tahiti...Only one thing beats a really good recipe, and that's an EASY really good recipe! You've got both here. Way to go, girl! Thanks for posting.
...txgammi"
21752,92798,6/28/2004,5,"This was completely yummy!  I have no idea what's an Italian squash, so I used two dark green Israeli courgettes (for color contrast, of course).  I also added a dash of paprika, have to put paprika in everything!  I had this with some grilled salmon and it was a perfect supper.  Next time I think I will add some caraway seeds for a Hungarian touch.  Thanks Tahiti, this one is a winner!"
29418,92798,10/18/2005,5,I made this last night as a side dish with a slice of ham cooked.  DH and I liked it alot.  The only thing that I did different was I added just about a tablespoon of olive oil with the butter and I sliced all of my veggies I didn't want shredded zucchini. And I cooked it until it reached the tenderness that we like.  We definitley be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.
119466,155480,2/17/2007,5,"These are attractive, delicious, and fairly simple to make. Rolling and cutting out cookies is not one of my favorite things, but the dough was easy to work with, and decorating them as described was a relatively easy way to make them look pretty. It got difficult to dip them as directed when I got to the last few, so I just drizzled the white chocolate over those. I ended up with 19 cookies using a 3-inch cookie cutter. Thanks for posting the recipe!"
496982,155480,5/8/2007,5,OMG!!! These cookies are so GORGEOUS! It's a good way to impress someone special!
478175,155480,8/7/2007,5,The taste was really awesome... they melt in your mouth!! mmm....
377161,155480,12/2/2007,5,"Make these every year with my
granddaughter for Valentines's 
Day at school. Great cookies."
589761,155480,2/9/2008,5,"Easy Breezy Beautiful!! (and don't I look fancy!)  Took me less than an hour from start-clean up to whip these up.  I don't like the taste of altered chocolate (especially when melting), so I used Baker's Melting chocolate squares which required no addition of shortening. Also, baking these on my stone rather than on baking sheets shortened the overall bake time. Great addition to my Valentine's Day Goodie Baskets-- Thank You!"
565592,155480,2/11/2008,4,"These are really tasty cookies!  I used some leftover ganache for the dipping and drizzling, so I can't vouch for that portion of the recipe, but I followed the rest exactly.  I had some trouble with the dough sticking to my rolling pin, so I stuck it in the fridge for 30 minutes or so and it went much more smoothly.  I got about 3 dozen cookies out of the recipe using a 3"" cutter.  These were a big hit with my hubby, so thanks for the tasty treat!"
140806,155480,2/11/2008,3,These look gorgeous but the actual cookie recipe didn't meet expectations. I had fun decorating them but I had to flash freeze after every step because the cookies were barely staying together. I'm not sure what happened. I followed the recipe exactly.
607482,155480,2/13/2008,5,This recipe was super easy to make and tasted awesome!  I gave one to each of my employees in their goodie bags and they loved them!  The only thing that really made them good was I keep them in the freezer and eat them straight out of there!  They are so tasty and choc-o-filled!
756324,155480,2/14/2008,5,"Easy cookies to make in a relative short period of time. I used 1/2 cup of butter and 6 generous ounces of cream cheese instead of all butter....I only dipped a generous half of the cookie in chocolate, drizzled the white. Cookies were gone in an evening...."
698495,155480,2/14/2008,5,"amazing recipe! I was skeptical at first, as was DH. But finished product is wonderful! I used chocolate almond bark instead of the white chocolate chips, and teh drizzled with pink melting candy. Beautiful, easy, tasty... Perfect for Valentines Day!

I did find that cooking 10 min instead of 8 stopped the cookies from breaking when dipping them. Thanks for posting Rachel55!"
162401,155480,2/15/2008,5,I love these cookies! My 7 yr old daughter and I made these today. They were so easy and delicious. I added a 1/2 t. of almond extract just because my family likes the flavor. My DD took some of the dough and made little mini hearts (1 inch) and decorated them with some of the white chips before baking. They make addictive little cookie bites ! Next time I will double the recipe!
633520,155480,2/8/2009,0,I don't know what happened but these were terrible for me. They tasted aweful. I probably did something wrong so I will try again.
1128706,155480,2/12/2009,4,"I made these today with my kids and they are so yummy!  But, mine kept falling apart.  I think the first batch I made was rolled out too thin.  It helped making them a bit thicker.
Anyone know why they were falling apart or what I can do to keep them together?!
Other than that, they are BEAUTIFUL and tasty!"
1167543,155480,2/12/2009,2,"While I think the concept is darling, I think there is a key ingredient, i.e. egg or something else to ""bind"" it all together.  As it stands the flour and cocoa are only moistened by the butter and slightly flavored by the sugar and vanilla, which leaves it a bit dry and crumbly.  I am going to try this again with an egg and then I'll report back if it made a difference on the falling apart.  Unless someone else knows a secret, you cannot make these above a bite size portion and not have them fall apart, there's nothing to hold it together."
631213,155480,2/13/2009,5,"Other cooks thought this dough was too dry and I thought so too at first. However, it ISN'T! It is more like a shortbread dough, very buttery, making delicious cookies. I recommend if you find the dough too crumbly to take it out of the bowl and really work it with your hands before you roll it... I found that really helped to hold it together. 

Also even though another chef found refrigerating the dough to be useful, I thought the opposite was the case. The cold dough was too hard to roll and it needed to be warmed up (working it with the hands) to roll well.
Great, EASY recipe!"
584512,155480,2/13/2009,3,"The cookies were dry and fell apart easily, I think the batter was missing an egg."
785032,155480,2/14/2009,5,This dough was nice to work with.  I didn't have any chocolate on hand so I warmed some icing and dipped using that.  Yummo!
1106461,155480,2/14/2009,5,"Terrific cookies.  I had crumbly cookies with the first batch but looked around and realized I had not added all of the flour.  Subsequent batches are fantastic.  My cookie cutter was broken so I rolled them into a ball, tapped it flat and baked for 13 minutes.  We are having a humid day and that may make a difference in the time."
724246,155480,2/15/2009,5,it does help if you roll the cookie dough with your hands few times before you roll it flat and cut with the cookie cutter.  also bake it more than 8 mins helped.  these cookies need to be kept in the refrigerator....especially after you dipped them with chocolate.
166084,155480,2/15/2009,5,"Rachel, 
These were wonderful!  I always like to make cut-out cookies for Valentine's Day and made my coconut sugar cookies for 30 years, but saw this picture of your Chocolate Heart Cookies and wanted to try them.
This dough is the easiest to whip up!  I have the rubberbands that you put on rolling pins for the exact thickness, which I used here and I got 30 cookies using about a 2"" cutter from the 1/4"" thickness.  I did use more than a 'light dusting' of flour, however, because the dough was sticking to the countertop.
I baked mine for 10 minutes, cooled on the pan for only 2 minutes, then put them on a wire rack.  When cool, I  dipped them in white almond bark and drizzled with milk chocolate, then put tiny pink, white and red nonpariel sprinkles on them before the drizzle dried.  They were all gone in one day!
My family loved them!
Thanks, so much for a fun, easy  recipe!"
414385,155480,2/16/2009,5,"I made 2 batches of these several days apart.  The first batch turned crumbly and lost several cookies through breakage.  The ones that survived turned out so  gourmet-ish that I decided to try a second batch. I left the butter out several hours allowing it to become room temperature...this seemed to make a big difference.  The dough was very pliable.  I used powdered sugar instead of flour to dust the counter/table and rolling pin...that worked well, the powdered sugar ""melts"" during the baking and doesn't leave the white residue that flour does.  Our B&B guests enjoyed them!"
928833,155480,3/9/2009,4,"I made these for a bridal shower and I wasn't very impressed.  However, the bride loved them.  I must admit they looked beautiful, when they didn't fall apart.  We made three batches of them and followed the recipe exactly.  All three batches turned out the same.  We did have to bake a little longer than the eight minutes. The actual cookies seemed bland to me until you put the chocolate on them.  They had a bit of a flour taste to them.  I should have read the reviews and rolled them out in powdered sugar.  I think that would have helped."
439506,155480,3/29/2009,3,"These were beautiful presentation-wise, but for me, very disappointing taste-wise.

They were crumbly and very hard to dip.  I found it impossible to dip each edge the way the instructions say without them falling apart.  I ended up just icing the entire cookie with the white chocolate, then drizzling with the brown chocolate.

I didn't like the flavor of the cookie, it was a little bitter, and also not very moist.  I thought it was odd that the recipe had no eggs.

Like I said, they looked beautiful, but they didn't taste good enough for me to make them again."
1710338,155480,2/13/2011,4,"I really liked the cookies! I did tweek it a little. I did not use the 1/4 cup baking cocoa or the 2 tablespoons shortening, divided. <br/>Basically, I made the standard cut out dough, which I had no problem rolling and cutting, it was perfect! I did find that the dipping of the sides of the cookie into white chocolate was slightly difficult. So I used a knife and spread the melted white chocolate across the cookie, each one having a different design. Then I used an icing bag and melted some milk chocolate chips in the microwave. Using a #5 tip, I drizzled the chocolate across the cookies as desired. I then used peppermint flavored sprinkles on some of the cookies!! They were a hit!!"
1098277,155480,2/13/2011,5,"I reviewed this cookie on Feb 7th and I would like to have deleted that review but cannot figure out how to.  These cookies are fabulous! I made them exactly as written and they turned out wonderfully.  They are a bit of work. It's a three step process: The baking, the white chocolate then the semi-sweet chocolate, but so worth the time.  These cookies turned out wonderfully. They look fabulous and they taste great! I did not find dipping them in the white chocolate to be difficult. You really just have to take your time.  They look amazingly alot like the original photo! I will be definitely be making these again!"
1813203,155480,3/9/2011,3,I tried this recipe for my daughter's daycare class for Valentine's day this year.  They turned out well but you definately need the chocolate dipping for an even flavor.  I will definately make them again and try this time to be more artistic! :)
140008,155480,6/29/2011,3,"As other have said, these cookies were kind of bland and crumbly when dipping was attempted.  But they are so beautiful and once you add the chocolate they don't taste half bad."
317809,177644,8/17/2008,5,We gave this jam a try today. It was fun and easy to make. The aroma still fills my kitchen and we can't wait to try it out.
97901,177644,7/17/2009,5,"This worked out great! It is definately strawberrybanana-you can taste each. I was worried it wasn't going to set up b/c it was pretty runny when we went to bed, but it was solid the next morning. It took me about 5 bananas to get enough. I didn't add the butter to reduce the foaming and I would strongly reccomend adding it. I had a TON of foam to skim off!!!!!!"
91340,177644,8/21/2009,5,Lovely Strawberry banana jam. The Banana takes center stage in this one but isn't overpowering. My 14 year old son love this one on PB&J sandwiches. Pretty color and sets up nicely; a little loose but that is typical for home canned jams. Thanks for posting! :-)
1352668,177644,8/23/2009,5,This was really great jam.  My husband already asked me to make more so we won't run out!  The strawberry/banana combo complement each other so nicely.
134289,177644,8/25/2009,5,Yummy!!  Very easy to make!!
2282309,177644,6/2/2012,0,I doubled everything except the sugar and the pectin and it turned out perfect!
175985,203931,1/5/2008,4,"Would definitely make this again, but I felt the meat was rather dry the first time I made it.  Tried it again tonight and mixed 4 slices of bread, soaked in milk, with the meat before dipping in the egg and milk mixture.  Excellent and not too dry.  Youngest asked for thirds!"
254614,203931,1/7/2008,4,"I agree with the previous reviewer, the mixture was a little too dry and I knew it before I dipped in the egg and cracker crumbs so I added some evaporated milk but if someone is not purchasing lean hamburger, this is the perfect recipe because there is enough fat content to make it juicy and not dry. I also added a little A-1 sauce to the meat for flavor but that is a personal prefence. Thanks for posting."
46981,203931,4/18/2008,5,Wonderful easy recipe!! My whole family loves it.  We put brown gravy with some mushrooms on top to juice it up a bit.
29782,203931,7/21/2008,5,"Most excellent recipe! I had no problems at all with this recipe. It was fantastic!  My husband loved it and said this was a perfect meal.  I made a white gravy to have over the steaks. This recipe is a keeper and one I will make again. 
Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
915877,252765,8/8/2008,5,"Tastes great, I had it on wheat bread with mayo made with olive oil. The olive oil flavor especially goes well with the cucumbers. YUM!"
74342,274774,3/20/2008,5,"Easy to make and very filling.  An excellent potluck or picnic recipe.
  I didn't have enough  catsup and had to use a little barbecue sauce.  I also had to use white vinegar.  This recipe is very adaptable and can be changed to accomodate add ins or substitution of ingredients if you should desire to experiment."
131674,274774,5/21/2008,5,Perfect meal for teenagers.  My boys lapped this dish up and asked for more.   Made for Photo Tag.
226863,274774,10/15/2009,4,I agree with another poster....this recipe is perfect for teenage boys!  I found it to be a little sweet.  But definitely an easy recipe to make and enjoy!
1072593,274774,11/17/2010,5,"And the clouds opened up and you could hear the angels singing from the heavens!  Okay, maybe over-dramatic, but this was awesome."
1617537,274774,6/2/2011,5,Easy and I loved it and so did my toddlers.
2128654,274774,1/13/2012,5,"This recipie is very tasty,but little to sweet for me next time i will add less brown sugar."
931092,324792,10/20/2011,5,This recipe is amazing and originally came from The Pioneer Woman <br/>http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2008/02/sherried_tomato_soup/
302094,351701,2/5/2010,5,"I needed a topping for my chicken pot pie and found your recipe. I am so glad I did. This was wonderful and easy. I did have to add about 2 Tbls. of more milk, for the consistency, but that might be because of our elevation: 7200 ft. I wonder if this would work for cobbler but adding sugar to the batter? Great recipe I will be using this for pot pie from now on, thanks so much for posting Joyce!"
486229,351701,7/25/2010,5,"Delicious! The best pot pie topping I have ever tasted...and so quick and easy to make. I think I put a little too much topping on my last pot pie as it soaked up almost all of the liquid. It tasted great, but in the future I will either cut down a bit on the topping or add extra liquid to make up for it. :-)<br/>Thanks for posting!"
231120,351701,5/10/2011,5,"Tasty, easy to make and completes the casseroles I throw together from random leftovers. hank you for posting this, I have already made it twice in the last 2 weeks and I am sure wll make it often!"
1003039,351701,7/17/2012,4,This was very good!
386447,351701,7/15/2013,5,"What a tasty and easy recipe for pot pie crust !  I ended up putting the pie under the broiler for a couple of minutes at the end of baking time, just to brown the crust a little bit."

60716,438538,3/6/2011,5,"Wow! The batter reminded me of brownie batter because it was so thick. This is a decadent and lucious cake, oh my. I asked my DH for his opinion as he was eating his slice and all he could do was throw his thumbs up while holding on tight to his fork for fear somebody would steal his plate LOL. Awesome cake! Made for PAC Spring 2011."
482376,438538,3/14/2011,4,"This was a very nice cake recipe. My favorite part about it was the chocolate chip addition! The batter was very thick. I wondered if mine was too thick and if it was due to using a cake mix that was made with pudding THEN adding more pudding mix.? It came out dense..but more importantly, it had great flavor. I needed to double the frosting recipe because I sliced my cake to make 4 layers. Thank you for posting!"
653438,483954,11/6/2012,5,"Made for Fall PAC 2012 and what a winner!  I did cut the recipe down for DH and I but followed the instructions and as suggested served over rice in baked tortilla bowls, garnished with cheese, black olives, green onions, avocado and sour cream....YUMMY!   Thank you for posting."
528468,65266,7/11/2013,4,good flavor but mine turned out soggy
678857,8170,7/11/2009,5,This delicious marinade provided us with moist and tender chunks of chicken.  The flavor was delicious and the best part - it was quick and easy.  I added some think and chunky salsa to the rice - gave it a little extra flavor.  Thanks for providing a terrific supper tonight.
13828,64469,8/3/2003,4,The results were very tasty but the recipe was more time intensive than I expected.  One taster commented that he thought the recipe was better on the following day.  The amount of asparagus could have been doubled.
57961,84494,11/2/2005,4,Made this for a work luncheon and it was all gone.  Personally I would double the salt and pepper next time but for a Mac& Cheese it was very good and easy.
149043,98542,8/29/2004,5,"So simple and so delicious.  I didn't add the bacon bits but I bet that is good.  The green,white and red make a pretty presentation.  The dressing was just enough to coat which is the way we like it.  Thank you for posting.  We will make it often. "
71460,98542,10/12/2004,5,"What a great, simple salad! And it is really pretty with the red, white and green.  I served it with Grilled Paninis #16432."
133174,98542,2/6/2005,4,This was the healthiest think for the superbowl.  It has a nice creamy texture.  The only thing I might add would be some salt and/or pepper.
66008,98542,4/25/2005,4,I really liked the ease and healthiness of this recipe. I also believe the addition of a little salt and pepper would be nice.
605921,98542,9/2/2008,2,"Not my thing really, but DH liked it. It's like salad without the lettuce."
870705,98542,11/23/2010,5,This was great!  It made a wonderful broccoli salad..........I left out the cauliflower.  I will be making this again!
53959,112973,1/28/2006,5,You can never go wrong with potatoes. It is one of my favorite foods. I made it exactly like stated and it was delicious. Yummmm!!!!!
57042,112973,3/7/2007,5,I gave this 5 stars. My family loves mashed potatoes. I make mine very close to this except I use milk and black pepper. Thanks for posting a comfort recipe! Christine (internetnut)
174096,112973,8/29/2011,5,"Great and simple, as stated!  I used fat free evaporated milk and did not peel the potatoes first.  Thanks for sharing!  Veg*n Swap 37"
163112,121930,5/25/2005,5,"Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.  Absolutely delicious.  Fast & easy to boot.  What more could a mom ask for?  "
57695,121930,9/27/2005,5,Yummy!! This was light and refreshing! Not too tart and not too sweet!! Made it with Rita L's Lemon Curd Recipe #61278. 
157425,121930,10/3/2005,5,I topped a store bought lemon angel food cake with this parfait and  warm double strawberry sauce also a recipe by sarahsmomi. Awesome dessert! The parfait is so creamy and not overly tart. Very simple and quick to make too.
189643,121930,11/9/2005,5,"Soooo good! I love lemon and fluffy desserts and strawberries and ,I guess, everything about this! I was a little short on strawberries (thanks to my kids snitching...) so I glazed the top layer with lemon curd so it would look more full. This is wonderful. Thanks!"
488200,121930,4/22/2007,4,"Very yummy, and easy, this recipe gave me a reason to learn to make lemon curd. It is easy and delicious. I added in some grham cracker crumbs in with they parfait layers to make it interesting. Served it in a margarita glass! Not too sweet, not too tart, just right!"
431813,121930,10/8/2007,5,"Very tasty and light!  I made some lemon curd last week that needed to be used up, and this was a perfect way to use it.  It was enjoyed by all, and it was so pretty!!!  Thanks Leslie!"
63462,121930,5/11/2008,5,"OMIGOSH - this was SOOO good.  I macerated the strawberries in a little sugar and some triple sec for a few hours, but this would have been scrumptious even with the berries plain.  A lovely dessert - very elegant looking but oh so very easy!"
1547163,121930,4/19/2010,3,Yeah ... I tried this .. was very tasty ....
955054,150076,1/23/2009,5,"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!! I had some leftover turkey and wanted to use it up - tried the recipe - and the family went wild!!!  Both of my daughters said they couldn't eat it fast enough.  I pride myself on my own chili recipe, but this one is uniqe and wonderful and will replace mine for sure!  Thanks so much!!!"
219318,150076,9/16/2009,4,"I added a tsp of cumin, and only used 1 tsp of regular salt, and 1/2 tsp tabasco sauce, but otherwise stuck to the ingredients pretty exactly, using a 28 ounce can of tomatoes with their juice, and a can of black beans, rinsed and drained.  I cooked the chili in a crock pot on low for about 7 hours.  We all enjoyed it with a side of corn bread."
201581,188691,1/26/2007,5,"This is my first time using Dreamfield pasta. This is quick and flavorful! I can't wait to have my leftovers for lunch today. Made for Please Review my Recipe--A NEW Tag Game. Thanks for posting a tasty, healthy recipe Ed & Theresa!"
569083,205275,10/21/2008,5,we made this for a halloween party last year.  it was a huge hit - maybe a little to big - a few hangovers were attributed to the brew (all of which were men - and not women . . .lol)
100026,222836,4/17/2007,4,I subbed sweet potatoes for the regular and this one came out great thanks
1801376231,222836,6/12/2014,0,This is simply the best potato salad I&#039;ve ever made. Stick to instructions
376098,241085,1/15/2008,5,"Yum!  What a nice way to use white Ghirardelli chocolate!  I took these to neighbors as a house-warming treat, they loved them and so did we!  In fact, we kept the four corner pieces for ourselves!  Thanks for the recipe."
260818,241085,6/17/2008,5,"delicious, in a word.  Not sure if I would serve with chocolate syrup, too sweet for my taste. great recipe and thank you for submitting it."
113509,241085,2/15/2010,4,"Hubby and I thought these were pretty good. I halved the recipe and got a little nervous with the consistency of the dough at the end. Definately not pourable, it was more the consistency of a stiff cookie dough, and I had to spray my hands with non-stick spray and press it down into the cooking pan. Still they came out ok, and once cooked, I sprinkled some chocolate chips over top to melt, then spread across the top and sprinkled some slivered almonds over top the chocolate. This made a pretty good Valentines Day dessert for us. Thanks for posting."
37449,309979,10/6/2008,4,"I liked the flavor of the turmeric and curry powder! I made to use with some rice, but ended up eating it all by itself. Thanks! Made for Aussie Swap, October 2008."
795588,313457,7/22/2008,5,"I made this recipe exactly as written with no deviations. What a great cake! I do not like frosting, but I adore chocolate cake! This was fast, easy to put together and I had everything on hand. This cake was moist, light and very flavorful. A definite keeper! UPDATE*** 7/22/08: I made this cake again and drizzled some lines of Hershey's chocolate syrup on top before baking. I then used a skewer to make swirls and placed the cake in the oven. YUMMY! It is simply delicious. This recipe has many possibilities for additions. Very versatile and the swirls make a pretty presentation."
313009,313457,8/12/2008,5,I have this recipe in a Block Island Cookbook and have made it for 30 years. People beg for it. I have several toppings I use but one of the favorites is raspberry sauce. Peppermint stick ice cream is great with it also.
259150,313457,10/29/2008,5,"This cake was really good, the only thing I changed was that I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  My family really enjoyed it.  Thanks for posting!"
449500,313457,12/16/2008,2,"I don't know where I went wrong!  I followed the recipe exactly!  My cake came out nice and fluffy, but the taste was horrible!  The ""crust"" on it was crunchy, it was pretty flavorless . . . after half of a piece each, my husband and I decided to throw the rest out.  I definitely will not be making it again.  Sorry."
1084164,313457,12/18/2008,5,Our family loved this recipe! It was easy to throw together with ingredients that I had on hand. The cake came out light with a beautiful rise and the flavor was spot on. I will definitely be making this cake again.
831114,313457,12/21/2008,5,"Made this for my husband to see if would pass that ""My mom used to make this snack cake thing"" test. He loved it! He said it was almost like he remembered, but asked me to add a bit more chocolate to it next time. I have been looking for a snack cake recipe to satisfy him for some time. He said that the texture was dead on to what he remembered. I would like to add that I really liked too!"
329554,313457,2/5/2009,5,"This is a great recipe. I loved that it doesn't make a lot of cake because it's great for just a couple of people to keep for a snack and it's moist enough that is doesn't dry out before it gets eaten. I added a few chocolate chips to the top of the batter because I happen to have some, but it was chocolaty anyway. Great with my morning coffee and I am thinking of having it with ice cream and chocolate sauce. Thanks for sharing."
196600,313457,1/9/2010,5,This is a fantastic recipe. Thanks!!
231057,313457,1/25/2010,5,Thank you for a great chocolate cake recipe.  I used xylosweet in place of sugar and it was wonderful.  Very moist.  Entire family loved it.
106608,313457,2/4/2010,5,I have made this 3 times now. And it has turned out great each time. And with no need for milk or eggs it saves money. I love that you mix and bake in the same dish. This recipe is a real little gem. Thanks!
2210022,313457,6/8/2012,5,"What a great recipe to have and share.  I thought it was so easy & tasted so good I sent it to my busy sister and my sweet mom, they both loved it.  I think the better the chocolate the better the cake! I also dissolved a little instant coffee in the water to enhance the chocolate flavor.  Then I made a quick cocoa frosting to make it special."
761979,313457,5/14/2013,5,"Easy recipe, delicious most cake!   It was exactly what my family wanted and I was glad it didn&#039;t call for any eggs (since I was out at the time.)"
1468552,395592,12/1/2009,5,"I love this as a cool fruity sweet pie in the summer-time, with a graham cracker or vanilla wafer crust, only for the pie i don't add grapes. 
Have never thought of making it as a fruit salad, great idea, thanks for sharing!"
2498447,428089,11/13/2012,4,I came across this recipe by accident and it made me laugh because it is exactly what they serve over spaghetti in company cafeterias in Japan and also in small restaurants. I tried this version of the recipe (minus the fennel) and it was pretty darn close! The Japanese spaghetti they serve is thicker than typical here in the USA and it holds the sauce better. It is a very authentic recipe. Thanks for posting it.
424680,450058,4/27/2012,5,"Very easy to prepare & so flavorful, too! Made the recipe as given, & wouldn't change a thing! This is a wonderful keeper of a recipe, & I thank you for sharing it! We eat salmon about once a week or so, & this will be a great addition to the other ways I fix it! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in this Spring's round of Pick A Chef]"
29268,17130,1/21/2002,5,Very good.  Not too spicy.  Very flavorful.  With rice and beans it made a great mexican style dinner!
110078,17130,8/26/2005,3,Pork was very tender but it was just missing something.  There wasn't much flavor to this dish.  
313915,17130,5/2/2007,5,"Excellent dish not to spicy *****
Great and simple .Flavor awesome !!!"
60992,17130,6/10/2007,5,"I used pork as opposed to be and it took about 45 minutes longer of cooking to get mine tender. Instead of two tomatoes I used 1 and 1 can of spanish tomato sauce. So I cut the water to 1 3/4c. to compensate. I added a little chicken bouillion sprinkles for more flavor along with about 1 t. oregano. After I put it all together it looked runny to me so I added 1 diced potato to the mix. Well...it is PURE heaven. The flavor meld wonderfully and even if it is as verde as some..who cares with flavor like this? <agnificant, I will make this often for sure!"
178191,17130,10/31/2007,5,Used pork loin this time around and it came out tender but not as tender as I would have liked.  Taste was great.  I used canned chilies.  Would make again.  I'd be interested if changing the cut would change the tenderness of the dish
283251,17130,4/17/2008,4,"This was very good. And very easy to put together. I used a yellow bell pepper and two Anaheim chilis for the chilies. That made the dish SO pretty! Lots of color there. I let it simmer until the pork was tender and the sauce was thickenened, then served it over plain steamed rice.  Added lots of salt and pepper (personal preference) and about a tablespoon of dried cilantro. Yum! I'm having the leftovers for lunch today. I bet this would freeze well..."
600761,17130,7/21/2008,4,"This was excellent!  I used 1 red pepper, 1 medium jalapeno pepper and 1 cubanelle pepper (similar to a green pepper but lighter in color and milder in taste). I roasted the peppers, but didn't peel them. The roasting definitely enhanced the flavor, so I'm glad I did that. I used also a fattier cut of pork so that it wouldn't dry out, but next time, I'll have to do a better job of trimming the excess fat : ( Overall, I was pleased with the tenderness of the pork ~~ I cooked for about 50 minutes. As I made it, the dish was a bit on the spicy side, so next time I'll omit the jalapeno pepper. I served with Recipe #17126 and it was a delicious combo.  Thanks for posting!"
424680,55571,5/6/2007,5,A very tasty spread that I found to be great on bagels with cream cheese! It will also make a nice addition as a dip or cracker spread! Thanks much for so simple a recipe!
21752,55913,3/25/2003,5,"Thank you thank you thank you!!!!  I can find kosher Thai fish sauce but am not happy with all the unpronounceable ingredients on the label.  I made up a batch of this the other day, had some last night mixed with some grilled salmon and sauteed spinach.  Not exactly Thai, but delicious nonetheless!  A perfect low-carb dinner!  Thanks, Aviva, I have so many ideas now what I'm going to do with this stuff!"
897162,55913,7/27/2008,0,"The anchovy is overwhelming,otherwose pleasant."
144635,32082,1/15/2006,5,"My husband (who has never baked before) made it while I was out and said it was very easy. Even added raisins and says that next time he'll try some nuts in it! We didn't bother with frosting either. Thanks, Debbb. Dee in Coquitlam"
339661,55913,10/14/2008,3,"At some point, fish sauce makers in Thailand will begin to seek certifications through the Union of Orthodox Congregations or some other kashrut certifying agency.  Until then, people will have to rely on recipes like this one.  I lived in Thailand for many years and am familiar with how it should taste and how it is made.  I have no doubt that most of the major brands (Golden Boy, Tra Chiang or Tiparos) would meet the requirements but the Thai vendors need to respect the fact that many Jewish consumers will want to see the mark on the bottle before accepting the product as kosher.  This recipe is passable (but has a much stronger anchovy flavor than the real thing.  In terms of palatability, I would rate this recipe a 4, but in terms of authenticity in flavor for making a real Thai dish, I had to give it two stars which is why the final mark is 3 stars out of 5.

I personally do use Thai fish sauce for my own coking only as I trust that it would be considered kosher under Kashrut laws."
1569951,55913,6/14/2010,3,"This sounds good and I have been interested in finding this too, anyone ever try worcheshire sauce? Do you mix it with meat meals?"
1011583,55913,8/31/2011,5,"SUCH a help. While I don't have to worry about keeping Kosher, I do have allergies as well as celiac. So... no storebought fishsauce for me, alas. There isn't a brand on the market that I've found that can safely promise to not have any shellfish tucked away somewhere in the bottle. And I'm rather found of breathing! This is perfect and a much needed addition for when I want to cook something Asian. Between this, good GF tamari, and homemade versions of blackbean sauce and oyster sauce (another item that allergies make a work around so important) - I can once again cook my favorite Thai, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean food! Thanks so much. Allergies and celiac have limited my husband and I's ability to go out to restaurants and explore different food cultures - but honestly? I think we're : having more fun, getting better tasting healthier food, and saving money doing it ourselves at home."
707671,76804,3/7/2008,5,"This was a big WOW  for me.  It really was great. I had no idea I was going to get this much flavor out of this recipe. What I did different was I used 4 lrg links of Italian sausage and 3/4 of a grn bell pepper and 3/4 of a red bell pepper,and about 1/2 cup of water. Wow this was fantastic. I will make this again. I will try it with rice next time. Thank You so much"
1631492,76804,11/12/2010,3,"This was good, but my husband and I both thought it was missing something, maybe garlic.  I will be trying it again with that addition. Very easy."
189397,105874,1/24/2005,4,"I did not add the peppers as I did not have them on hand and I have a few people who don't like too ""hot""..Overall, very tasty, but the cornbread mix seemed to lack some moisture.  I cooked 5 minutes less than suggested but it still seemed a little dry...maybe add sour cream and regular corn instead of the creamed corn?"
302961,105874,5/19/2006,5,"This was one great recipe and really easy to make.  Cream styled corn is always used in this type of recipe and I followed your's to a T. 

"
573988,105874,9/1/2007,4,"My family loved this recipe. Easy to make. The second time I cooked it,I added cooked brocolli to it. It was outstanding. Thanks. eschruff"
306951,105874,3/26/2010,5,"This recipe is a family favourite for comfort food, and has been for a few years. I don't use the cornstarch in the meat, and usually substitute the flour with cornmeal or cornflour. As other reviewers suggest, ingredients can be added and substituted with ease. Thanks!"
439174,105874,1/12/2011,5,"This recipe has turned out to be a family favorite.  I pretty much use as listed in the ingredients for the recipe, but have made changes if I didn't have the right ingredients on hand.  It has always turned out great.  Thank you!"
159398,107225,1/17/2005,4,I actually saw this recipe on the Mrs. Dash website and made it a few months ago. Same idea except you sprinke it with Mrs. Dash table blend. I cooked it for only about 45 min. I thought it tasted great.
125458,107225,6/3/2005,3,"this was alright, but still rather bland for my taste. perhaps it needs some seasoning for sauce as it is rather insipid on its own. i am sure this is just a matter of personal preference, and others will like this more. "
53932,107225,1/21/2007,4,I liked this--used a lemon flavored olive oil (which I might not do again).  I just used salt and pepper without additional seasonings and was quite happy with the results.
494084,107225,7/29/2007,5,This could not be more plain but at the same time more delicious!  Perfect preparation (except that I cooked mine for only about 50 min).  Just make sure you season well.  The flavor and texture is AWESOME!
254614,107225,10/2/2007,5,"Fantastic! I stripped the leaves and cut the bottom off, but then cut each flowerette with the stem in 3 vertical long strip leaving the stems attached. I cooked 2 large heads, two pans, poured olive oil in the shallow baking pans, tossed the cauliflower with my hands to coat. Baked 400* degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes, turning with a spatula once. The cauliflower had so much flavor!
I lightly sprinkled a little salt on it after cooking. The 6 & 8 year olds gobbled them up, calling them white trees. I will continue to make, this a simple recipe and the stems are delicious. I didn't brown them as much as the picture. 
No need too, I wanted them tender but a little crispy and that is exactly what I got. I would test one ""tree"" out to see if it is done in 15 minutes or 20 minutes, depends on the thickness of the cut. I am baking four heads this Saturday for a family dinner. This was not bland tasting for my family. You could add any type of pepper if you want too. I also served a bowl of Ranch Dip if anyone wanted."
326183,107225,10/22/2007,5,"Oh my goodness! This was wonderful. Even the SO (who thinks that veggies should be labeled a controlled substance and kept under lock and key) thought it was good. I added a tad bit of cayanne pepper, and lowered the baking temp to 375 for 45 minutes. We'll be making this again. Thanks!!!"
332211,107225,1/22/2008,5,"What a nice, simple recipe.  Roasted at 450 degrees probably for 40 minutes, turning several times. Cauliflower was very crispy.  Felt like we were having fries for dinner. :)"
144897,107225,2/5/2008,5,"Yum! This is so easy and tasty.  I've been eating it every day since I've found this recipe!  I've been trying to do this with a few other veggies too.  So far, carrots aren't great, but the asparagus was pretty tasty also :D"
378710,107225,10/19/2008,4,I love roasted veggies and when I saw this recipe I thought roasted cauliflower why not. This was so easy and tasty and recipe that I'll make again. I did add a light dusting of garlic power before baking. Thanks for posting. Made for Fall PAC 2008.
673201,107225,3/26/2009,5,"I made this a few days ago with the olive oil and garlic salt. It was soooo good. I decided today to make it using spray (no calorie) olive oil and a little cayene pepper. It was still sooo good! I only cooked mine around 35 minutes. Next I'm going to try this using broccoli, onions ect! Thanks for a wonderful idea!"
189643,117220,5/10/2005,5,"Delicious! The garlic flavor infused the tomatoes and made this a special dish. My brothers, who dislike goat cheese, even said this was good! So its definitely a winner! Thanks!"
143917,117220,11/30/2007,5,This is fabulous! Wanted to put together dinner with things I had. This was very different with the goat cheese. Yummy!
148894,117220,9/10/2008,5,Outstanding!
780046,117220,2/27/2010,5,"Wow this was really fantastic. I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry, and they were slightly tart and sweet. Definitely watch them in the oven, I needed to lower my oven temp since the tomatoes were starting to shrivel after only an hour of cooking. Overall, this makes for a nice light meal and I would definitely make it again!"
318262,117220,5/5/2012,5,"Wow - yummy! Goat cheese explosion! What a fun, fresh spring meal. I served with a salad and crusty bread and topped with parmesan cheese and a drizzle of balsamic. Will make again!"
129333,146018,1/3/2006,5,very good I added a can of chopped tomatoes.  I used flat noodles will try the angel hair next time.  I also used all chicken broth  no water.  next time I may replace the water with white wine.
95743,146018,4/22/2008,5,Wow.This was sooo good and so simple.  Tasted like I spent a lot more time and energy than I actually did.  I used penne.
392858,146018,2/23/2011,5,Wow!!  This is delicious.  Tasted like a restaurant meal. The flavors were perfect and it was easy to make.  I'm looking forward to making this for company.  I used dried herbs and white wine.  So good.  The house smelled wonderful while it was cooking.  Thanks for a great recipe.
329251,157923,8/27/2006,4,"Very good. The simplicity of the flavors was excellent, nothing had to compete with anything else, you could taste each seperately, but they blended very well together at the same time. Very good, thanks"
239711,161772,6/23/2011,5,"I can't believe I forgot to review this!  I made this dish years ago for a study on Uruguay and found it absolutely delicious.  It's much easier to make than it appears.  You do have to work quickly with the filo dough, but it's totally worth the effort."
285039,161772,4/9/2012,5,"Delicious and easy side dish for Easter, and a wonderful use for colored eggs!  This was the prized dish at my Easter meal!"
1800585544,161772,12/9/2013,0,this was delicious slurp
101376,181085,3/30/2008,5,"This is a wonderful pasta salad! So fresh and flavorful! I loved the dressing for it! 
Made for PAC '08."
528617,181085,6/24/2010,5,This is a very tasty and easy salad to make.  I didn't have any peas and I added rotel tomatoes.  I added a chipolte mayo sauce to the salad and thought it added a nice zip to the recipe. Otherwise this was a tasty summer treat!
653438,181085,4/29/2014,5,This was delicious!  I cut it in half but otherwise followed the instructions.  We loved the green beans in the salad plus we really enjoyed the dressing.  We will be using this salad this summer when it really gets warm.  I might even add some cooked shrimp or some protein for a complete meal.  Thank you for posting.  Made for Spring PAC 2014.
383346,190466,2/24/2007,5,Unbelievable how it tastes wonderful.  Each bite was almost an orgasmn loll  I used a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes.  I added half a green pepper diced and also an onion diced.  It cooked 6 hours and it was perfect.
283021,35621,2/17/2007,5,"Awesome, definetely a keeper!"
252816,190466,5/24/2007,5,"I used a boneless pork roast 2 3/4 pounds . Took it out the sack it came in and  it was 2 eqaul in size pieces.I followed the directions almost..I used diced Italian tomatoes..Cooked it on high for 4 hours and then 4 hours more on low.The entire house smelled wonderful while this was cooking and hours afterwards...Made the gravy using a little cornstarch. The meat tasted incredible,BEST with the gravy poured over it ..I also poured it over mashed potatoes..LOTS of flavor the meat was SOoooo tender.To be perfectly honest I wasnt too impressed the first bite or two,but after pouring the gravy over the meat I really changed my mind....I will definitley be making this again..Thank You for this recipe..."
229524,190466,5/26/2007,5,"WOW, great flavor.  Easy to make. Severed it over spaghetti"
32772,190466,7/7/2007,5,Tremendous!  What an unexpected treat.  This recipe was easy to follow and the taste is undescribable.  I served it over mashed potatoes.  I first shredded the pork roast and served the gravy on top of it and the mashed potatoes.
315084,190466,8/16/2007,5,Oh what a treat this was to eat. The aroma was mouthwatering while it was cooking during the day and two friends wanted the recipe even without tasting from just the wonderful aroma. I used pork tenderloin as that is what I had thawed and needed to use. I didn't have the tomatoes with green pepper and onion so I diced up a small green pepper and tossed in some onion flakes and it was absolutely delicious. Thanks so much for posting this wonderful recipe.
371738,190466,10/7/2007,1,"I really wanted to like this, since I love my slow cooker.  But, it just didn't work for the family at all.  Sorry.   I followed the directions to a ""T"", but I guess it just comes down to personal tastes.  We really didn't like it."
245301,190466,2/10/2008,4,"I've made this several times.  It's a good and easy weeknight meal.  I double the sauce recipe and shred the roast and serve as a sauce over spaghetti.  Great flavors.  I highly recommend that you do not use low fat cream of mushroom soup - - it changes the texture and won't be as good. Also, the first time I made this I used onion soup mix instead of italian salad dressing mix and it was fine."
546021,190466,3/14/2008,5,"Oh my God, this was the MOST TENDER pork I've EVER had!  It was SO YUMMY, we had ours with mashed potatoes, and it will definately be a regular meal on our table!  Also pretty low fat if you use a lean cut, and fat free soup : ) ENJOY!"
369715,190466,1/4/2009,4,I followed the recipe exactly as written and this was enjoyed by the whole family. I cooked mine on low for six hours and it was done perfectly. This was a very different way for us to enjoy a pork roast.
136447,190466,3/17/2009,4,"Aromatic tasty and easily  made with things you already have-which is a no-brainer and in my wheel-house as a cook!
I followed directions as best I could with the following exceptions:

1. Added .5 cup of frozen green peppers from last summers garden to can tomatoes. 

2. I used 2- tsp of minced garlic not 6-8 cloves minced.
3. 2-Tsp of spicy spaghetti seasoning instead of salad dressing mix.
4. Cooked only 4 hours not 6 (1 hour on high and 3 hours on low) but it turned out great anyway.

This is a keeper recipe because it is verstile, tasty and easy to make. However, next time I'll ad onions and cook for 6 hours. Thanks PrincessMOM"
1002102,190466,10/12/2009,5,"I really loved it.  It may not be a show stopper, but it was a really great super simple dish.  I think it really will add variety to serving pork. I thicked up the sauce at the end but thats it."
173030,190466,10/5/2010,5,This was enjoyed by the entire family.  I followed the recipe exactly as listed.
75497,192173,2/14/2007,4,"I liked this a lot better than I thought I would... I was just looking for something different to do with ramen noodles!  I cut the recipe in half to feed my 3 year-old daughter and myself. The only problem was that I couldn't get it to ""flip"", so mine broke apart and looked more like scrambled eggs.  Still tasty, though!"
464999,192173,3/18/2007,3,It was good. It would be great as a brunch or late breakfast meal. You can use any time of ramen noodles though.
174096,207849,10/31/2008,0,"I didn't make the recipe in its entirety, so I won't leave a rating, but I wanted to thank you for posting an excellent spicy peanut sauce!  I made it to go with chicken wings, and everyone at the get-together raved about it.  I also really appreciated that it uses ingredients that I had on-hand, since it was a last minute sauce we needed."
311625,207849,1/10/2009,3,"This was pretty good, though I didn't think the sauce was all that spicy. I did leave the tofu out but made as written otherwise."
427184,278969,1/27/2008,5,Loved this!! It was delicious with the yogurt. I did have to add a tad of water and non fat milk because I used all frozen berries and bananas. I also only used a pinch of sweetener. Thanks!
464080,278969,2/13/2009,4,"I, like the other reviewer, had to add liquid (some water and some non-fat milk) to get the smoothie thin enough to pour.  Good overall flavor though!!!  I really liked the cinnamon and the walnuts."
264440,282983,2/23/2008,3,"3 stars. This biscotti had a nice flavor, but wasn't really crunchy even when cooled.  The instructions don't say when to add the almond extract.  I baked the logs for 25 minutes and still found them somewhat raw in the middle. I sliced the logs into 1/2 inch pieces which gave me 32 biscotti. I also found I needed to bake the slices an extra 10 minutes. Made and reviewed for RSC#11"
206722,282983,2/23/2008,5,"I love a good biscotti, and this one has the potential to be outstanding. I'm having one of these right now with my morning coffee, and they taste just a tad too sweet for my taste first thing in the morning, so I may reduce the sugar a little next time. I also found that the baking time was too little....at least for my oven. A few technical notes: The directions don't mention where to add the almond extract, so I almost forgot. Also, just about every biscotti recipe I've tried before, suggests turning the biscotti on their sides for the second bake. I did that for this recipe as well. I actually baked the original 20 minutes (which could have used another 5), then 10 minutes on each side of the cut biscotti."
193516,282983,2/23/2008,4,"4 stars. These biscotti deserve 5 stars for taste. They taste soo good! I love the white chocolate chips with the orange. Mmm! Although golden brown on the outside, mine however, were only a little crisp just after baking but were not crisp in the days after baking. Perhaps a small reduction in liquid ingredients would make them crisper? None the less, a really delish biscotti. Reviewed for RSC #11."
67656,282983,2/23/2008,5,"Subtle and addictive flavors in this sophisticated rendition of one of my favorite treats.  I loved the soft honey flavor in the dough.  Orange was less evident in the flavor but but laced into the honey created a unique harmony greater than each component alone. As a matter of personal preference, I might omit the white chocolate next time and add more nuts.  Thank you for a wonderful submission and good luck."
773300,282983,2/24/2008,5,I really enjoyed this recipe!  They were slow to cook and brown the first time I baked them so the second time I made them I increased the butter to 1/2 cup and used 2 1/2 cups of flour and juice of just  1/2 of the blood orange.  I shared them with my co-workers who loved them.  I predict they will become an old favorite of mine in time. Wonderful flavor!
66008,282983,3/1/2008,5,"This was one of 3 biscotti recipes I made today. This recipe was excellent. I did not make it during the contest, because I could never find blood oranges. I used a mandarin orange which was sweet and juicy. I also used a tsp. of amaretta liqueur as I did not have any almond extract.  I also had to cook this longer than the recipe called for - I increased the cooking time by 10 minutes for the first cooking and then lowered the temp to 300 and baked for 20 min. on both of the cut sides. It had just the right crispness then and had a wonderful flavor! Thanks for a great recipe."
292160,282983,8/20/2008,5,These are delicious.  I made them for the ladies in my swim class and they really loved the biscotti with coffee.  Thanks for sharing.
568205,282983,8/20/2008,4,"Yummy! This was my first time making biscotti and it was very good. I couldn't get a blood orange, so I used a navel orange, but only used 2 T. of juice since blood oranges are smaller. I'm not sure if that was still too much or what, but my dough was very soft, so I popped it in the freezer for about 5 min. and it was the perfect consistancy then. I also left out the white chocolate because I'm not a huge fan. 
I think next time I will use slightly more orange zest and almond extract just to give them a little boost. All in all I nice little biscotti! thanks"
251917,282983,10/2/2008,5,FALL PAC 2008: Tink - these are awesome. I love the color the blood orange gives these cookies!! Wonderful citrus flavor!
498829,282983,11/2/2008,5,"Great Biscotti.  I did add a few thing to mine 1/4 cup each of white chocolate chips, pecans, and orange flavored cranberries.  Worked out fine for me, just really have to adjust the cooking time a bit.  
Thanks for sharing the recipes with us."
212609,320426,1/23/2009,4,"From a few ingredients you really can produce a good,filling and tasty meal.This is one of those recipes that fits the bill.Made from items that are generally found lurking around the average kitchen also makes it very practical.I added some finely diced leek and some sweetcorn to mine,just for personal preference,and also as this is one of those recipes that is totally open to individual interpretation.
The cornflake topping didn't really do it for me...it just seemed wrong on top of the rice and veg,but some of you may like that.
A solid 4 stars for you NELady,thanks for sharing.Made for PRMR."
286566,334869,11/11/2008,5,"I scaled this back to 3 serves and the DM and I enjoyed very much for lunch with a salad.  I baked it in a loaf pan and it only took 15 minutes all up in a 175C fan forced oven.  Thank you Good Looking Cooking the sharing, made for Swap #22 November 2008."
28087,350559,3/23/2009,5,"This is an excellent breakfast casserole, I made it exactly as written. Wonderful flavor and easy to make, this recipe is now in my breakfast recipe cookbook. *Made for Spring PAC 2009* Thanks!"
1704786,350559,12/18/2010,5,This is basically our every Christmas morning breakfast for as long as I can remember.  We like to add mushroons a small amount of onion.  Sometimes we add brocolli that we partially cook first. I seem to always add a little more bread then it calls for and we like to vary the types of shreaded cheese on top.
1786757,350559,8/23/2011,5,"OMG this is also our Christmas Day Breakfast for my whole life. I make this anytime I have to feed a number of people. So easy. I usually just mild cheddar cheese. I also do many variations. Broc and ham, but I dont cook broc first and it comes out cooked. Sausage and spinnach is really good (just throw in raw baby spinnach). You can add peppers, onion, anything you want and it comes out great. I mix a little milk also."
1131808,350559,11/26/2011,5,This was delicious! I needed something for the morning after Thanksgiving and it was a hit with the whole family (all 15 who stayed the night!). Made it exactly the way you suggested! I will definitely make this again. It was SO easy to make ahead of time and pop it in the oven when I needed it.
1236002,350559,9/21/2012,3,"I made this as directed, and I thought it was dry and too salty.  I took it to work and I didn't get any compliments on it, so I'm thinking it really wasn't that good."
742778,350559,12/24/2013,0,"This is a family favorite for us! Every time my sis is home from HI we have to have it. For my family I substitute cooked, crumbled bacon for the sausage. Wonderful!!"
1802444757,350559,2/2/2014,3,"Well, the posted recipe has no mention of milk like there is in most breakfast casserole recipes--perhaps an oversight by the poster. Therefore, it was dry as the one reviewer said--not awful but not a keeper and I did add a 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Based on what I am seeing elsewhere, the next attempt at this will be to use 2 cups of milk and only 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar. I&#039;m betting that will work."
1802471140,350559,2/9/2014,4,"Just made this, was my first attempt at a breakfast casserole. I let it sit overnight and the only thing I added was about a cup of milk, banged it in the oven at 325 for 45 min. Was soo good! Thank you for the recipe :)"
1803562600,350559,12/26/2014,1,There&#039;s something off with this recipe.  I agree that milk may have been accidentally omitted.  I made it today and it was super dry.
587675,357586,4/30/2010,5,"Oh My God - not sure which is better: how good it tastes or how easy it is to make. So glad you got over your embarrassment and decided to post this recipe. This chicken was so juicy, tender and full of flavor. I trimmed the excess fat and skin off the thighs and then marinated for about 3 hours in a plastic baggie (flipped bag every once in a while). I baked the thighs skin side down for the first 30 minutes and then flipped and baked skin side up for last 30. The skin came out all brown and pretty (saved the juices to serve with leftovers and rice).  Served with Roasted Fingerling Potatoes With Seasoned Salt #153305 and steamed broccoli. Thank you Epi Curious for such a great recipe, keep it up, there is absolutely nothing wrong with easy."
2001209058,357586,10/16/2016,5,I have searched for two hours for this recipe since making it last week. I finally found it. We absolutely thought it was delicious but use tomato basil dressing. So glad I finally found it!!! Thank you for sharing this one.
573325,418750,4/26/2010,5,"Oh wow, this is sooooooo yummy! It is a dense and chewy loaf, that is filled with fudgy fruity goodness. Mmmm, pure bliss! Plus its also quite healthy, what more can you ask for?
I used soft dried plums in place of the banana (which I cant have) and that worked out nicely, though next time I might just skip them alltogether. Instead of dried apricot I used dried cherries as thats what I had on hand. The cooked fruit, carrot and cinnamon mixture gave the bread a very dense fudgy consistency, that we liked a lot. Oh and the taste was soooo moreish! I only added 2 tbs of sugar to the dough, cause I like when most sweetness comes from the fruits. This way it was still super sweet and yummy.
THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this wonderful treat with us, Kate!
Made and reviewed for Everyday Is A Holiday Tag Game April 2010."
779699,418750,9/27/2010,5,Wonderful easy loaf! I used craisins in places of the sultanas because they were easier and it was great! Very dense and moist and full of the stuff that is good for you! Both DH and really enjoyed! Also very good warmed with some butter!!! Thanks for posting! made for holiday tag september 2010!
287671,32082,1/30/2006,5,"I am eating my second slice right now while I am writing this... hehe Superdelicious! Thanx Debb!! I used butter and 3 bananas, mashed, without measuring and the result...ooh la la...!!! I am going to make this cake again for my friends in our next gathering next week and also my baby girl's 1st birthday in March. Yummy!!!"
29196,418750,10/2/2010,5,"I honestly can't beiieve something so healthy can taste this good. Packed with fruit, relatively low in sugar and as far as the fat and fibre content goes-I could eat the whole loaf without feeling too guilty. I used brown sugar and a mix of apricots and craisins along with the sultanas.  I don't like cinnamon so much, so used mixed spice (similar to pumpkin spice) instead.  I can imagine this warm with custard or iceream as the texture is ""puddingy"" and it was delicious warm spread with Logicol to take it's photo.  Trust me, this will get made again and again as I continue on my weight loss journey!"
424680,418750,9/28/2011,5,"I'm with Lalaloula on this one ~ WOW! Definitely a most satisfying, great tasting loaf, & one that I could almost eat all by myself! And I already know I'll be making this one a handful of times come the end-of-year holidays, & I'll be sharing it in my Yule gift baskets, too! Made the recipe exactly as given & although I don't usually use sultanas, they were great in this recipe! Thanks so much for a great keeper! [Made & reviewed in Everyday Is a Holiday recipe tag]"
318262,440275,2/8/2011,4,This was good - nice consistency and easy to make but it was just a little too eggy tasting for me (not a huge egg fan). Smelled delicious baking and loved the addition of the chives. Made with a mix of sharp white cheddar and guyere.
29956,32082,9/20/2002,5,"Delicious!! I only had about 1 cup of mashed banana, but this cake still turned out beautifully. Didn't put frosting on cake, ( a personal choice) as it was moist and tasty enough. Just had some next day for morning tea, stays really moist and fresh. Great recipe."
43216,32082,12/20/2002,5,This is a wonderful cake and I made it with the frosting as suggested and it is out of this world. Thank You for sharing :)
82367,32082,6/14/2003,5,"This cake is FAB-U-LOUS!!!!!! I too only ended up with one cup of banana once i mashed them, so I threw in a spoonful of applesauce to make up for it just in case, but i really think that i probably did not have to,as Sueie said she got great results with only one cup of banana.I also used lemon juice to sour my milk and it worked out just great too,I got exceptional results! The layers baked up just beautifully and i could just tell when i took this out of the oven that it was going to be great...you know how you can just tell sometimes when something you have made comes out good?? I frosted as suggested with my favourite chocolate buttercream icing and i could not wait to cut this cake! Well....let me tell you,it will be one of my new favourite ways to use up those ripe bananas!! This cake is sooo moist and has great flavour. I thoroughly enjoyed it with chocolate buttercream icing but i can see me trying it with Peanut Butter icing in the future!! However i am sure it could stand on its own even without frosting!I bet this cake would be nice slightly chilled,Im gonna try it...with a big tall glass of milk, YUM! Thanks for sharing this Debbb,I know i will definitely be making this one again...A keeper for sure!:)"
24386,32082,2/22/2004,5,"I was looking for a recipe for banana nut cake to use up some very ripe bananas I had and instead found this one with chocolate added.  This is a great, different recipe and it was very chocolatey and moist.  I don't like sweet frostings so I just topped it with some whipped cream -super delicious!  Thanks for posting, Debb."
6357,32082,10/9/2004,5,I've made this cake and we enjoyed it! Very yummy!! Thanks for sharing.
193678,32082,2/6/2005,5,The best way to use too ripe bananas.  Butter instead of margarine works well too.
178319,32082,2/7/2005,5,Very Good!  I frosted with the chocolate peanut butter frosting I found on this site as well  Made for a very yummy combination!
22655,32082,3/19/2005,5,"YUMMY!!!!!!! Very good and simple cake. I skipped making an icing, melted peanut butter in the microwave, threw in some powdered sugar and milk and drizzles a little glazed all over. I also baked it in a 9x13 pan and it was perfect. A definite keeper!!!!!"
93132,32082,7/31/2005,5,"Cake turns out light, moist and very chocolaty.
I used butter with only 200 gms of sugar and mashed banana and the cake turns out just nice, not too sweet with slight bitterness from the cocoa.Cake tends to be alittle dry the next day but overall a great recipe, must try!!! "
156467,32082,8/23/2005,5,"This is a simple yet yummy recipe. No extra effort needed to look for other ingredients. With or without topping, kids and adult alike will love it. My friends even copied the recipe and tried it at home. Suggestion in doing the sour milk even made it easier. Keep on posting easy and delicious recipes like this. Thanks."
175116,32082,11/6/2005,0,"This is a delicious cake. I used 6oz butter and just two bananas without measuring them and it turned out super delicious. It even filled up my ridiculously large flower patterned tin which usually requires a double batch of cake mix, it makes a lot of batter. This cake was very well received at my office morning tea today."
4291,32082,2/5/2006,4,"This cake was very good, easy to make, and satisfied my grandson's chocoholic fix."
220702,32082,2/24/2006,5,"Super easy and oh, so yummy! A nice change from the usual banana bread or muffins I make with the overripe bananas. I also had some sweetened condensed milk left over from another recipe, which I microwaved with chocolate chips to make a simple fudge glaze for the top. Delish!"
105601,32082,5/7/2006,5,"This was really yummy, however I did find that the baking time was too long.  I set the timer for 35 minutes and it was done at that time.  Next time I'll set it for 30 and check it then."
94087,32082,7/5/2006,5,"One of my very favourite cakes, I love the combination of banana and chocolate.  This is the same as my own recipe. Thanks you Deb."
281871,32082,12/10/2006,5,"AH-MA-ZING! It didnt hv a very obvious banana taste just the way i like it. and it does taste better on the second day!it took me lttle longer to bake it all the way though. i had some overly riped banana and i needed to get rid of it and im so glad i picked this recipe! i didnt have much time so on my hands and this didnt take me very long. i baked it right before my ballet lesson(im 15) and didnt get a chance to try it yet. And the whole 3 hours i was in class, i couldnt wait to get home to taste it! THANK YOU DEBB!"
250031,32082,2/10/2007,5,We loved it! I did not frost it either; we just used whipped cream. Not too chocolately or banana-y. Rather light. And easy! My favorite kind of recipe.
290298,32082,2/26/2007,5,"This is a great recipe, I used spelt flour instead of plain flour amd soymilk instead of sour milk and it turned out very moist with a fantastic flavour
thanks Debbb"
284695,32082,3/8/2007,5,"Great recipe, I used 4 small extremely ripe bananas and added some roughly cut cooking chocolate to the mix. It turned out really well. Thanks for sharing!"
402559,32082,9/13/2007,5,"Used egg substitute, 3 bananas, buttermilk for the sour milk and added some peanut butter chips. This was absolutely wonderful and it was perfect for my monkey shaped cake. Thanks so much!"
476744,32082,9/16/2007,5,"So, I have a friend that is a New Zealander. His birthday was coming up and I was in charge of the cake. His wife told me that his favorite childhood cake was Chocolate Banana! Where o where was I gona find the recipe? Well, much to my surprise there were several on here but yours stood out. I made it and it was an enormous hit!!

Thanks for getting me out of a pickle! :)"
249657,32082,9/26/2007,4,"This was a really good cake. I made it as a birthday cake with a fudgy icing in between the layers and covered in chocolate ganache. I then packed the sides with toasted pecans, which turned out really great! Decadent!"
567558,32082,9/27/2007,5,"This cake turned out so well!  The layers were perfect.  I put a cream cheese icing on top and it was perfect!  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely be making it again!"
364143,32082,10/17/2007,5,1 word-  OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
515961,32082,1/31/2008,5,"I just made this cake and it is divine! great balance of flavor and the texture is great!  I made them into cupcakes and halved the cooking time, also I ran out of ingredients for icing on but they are still fab with out.  As my 3 yr old said they're ""yummylicious!"""
492029,32082,2/20/2008,5,"this cake is the bomb! i dont usually go for cakes with butter or marg coz i found recipes with oil are more moist, but this one is awesome! LOVED IT! thanks for posting :-)"
583860,32082,6/27/2008,5,"This cake is absolutely Delicious. Moist and fudgy, I just love it! Taste awesome with Chocolate Ganache!! I make it at least once a week. The best Chocolate Banana Cake ever!!!! Thank You so much!!"
226066,32082,7/18/2008,5,Made this wonderful cake for my dad's birthday!! Had some bananas to use and this recipe was perfect as I had all the ingredients!! Did use less sugar (about 1 1/4 cup). Thanks for a DELICIOUS cake!! :) Used recipe #44126 to frost!
544036,32082,7/22/2008,5,"This cake was fantasic, moist, easy to make and full of flavour. thanks so much for sharing i have made it several times and also as cupcakes. I have also shared your recipe with some friends who just had to have. thanks again."
301276,32082,7/28/2008,5,This is a fantastic recipe! I made it with peanut butter chocolate icing... tasted like Snickers chocolates! YUM! My friends raved about it!
164693,32082,8/12/2008,5,"AWESOME TASTE!!! So moist..hubby loved it..had to almost hide it,so I could have some too! ;-)"
619246,32082,9/25/2008,1,Way too much baking soda and baking powder. The cake was over powered by both and ruined the cake. I was completely disappointed because of so many positive reviews :(
458908,32082,10/3/2008,5,"OMG absolute heaven, moist banana background flavor with an iceable cake not like most breadish consistencies from the bananas, I made it in a 13X9 pan since it would stay fresher after cut that way, at least in our family it lasts better, i iced it with kittencals choc buttercream (using only 1/3 cup cocoa powder) perfect light choclate icing for this moist cake! I am not a great baker and this one came out perfect, thank you!"
84632,32082,12/13/2008,5,"This is one of the best cake recipes I have ever made! I made it for my sister's birthday in a springform pan so I could easily ice the sides (baked at 350 for 50-55min)
I also cut back the sugar to 1.5 cups and didn't measure the banana's (used 3 large). I didn't have skim milk for the sour milk so I used 2%.
I will definitely make this again!"
467148,32082,1/28/2009,5,"This is a really delicious, easy to make cake. It smelled so heavenly while it was baking! I forgot the salt, but it doesn't seem to have hurt anything. Yum!"
474993,32082,1/30/2009,5,"Everyone loved this! :) I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 cup cream cheese, 3/4 cup sugar and 3 mashed bananas. I also baked it for 50 minutes in a single 9"" round cake pan. Obviously I'm not one who follows instructions a lot.. but this cake turned out moist and definitely very well accepted! I sliced it into half, frosted with Chocolate Ganache [Ganache--217404] and more banana slices. Thank you so much! :)"
1151578,32082,1/30/2009,5,"Excellent! As good as everyone says. Didn't have cocoa so used some dark chocolate (ground instead). Also used butter vs/ margarine. Was good on its own but frosting gave it an extra wow. Garnished with an extra banana and strawberries. 

Froze one of the cakes and hope it still tastes good."
1020416,32082,2/21/2009,5,Very yummy cake! Moist and delicious. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
769890,32082,2/27/2009,5,"We loved it...didn't use any frosting.  I dusted with a ""BAM"" of powdered sugar.  I love using up my black bananas and expired milk!  :)  Thanks!"
629769,32082,3/21/2009,5,"I'm enjoying a piece right now.
Very good cake....moist and not overly sweet with just the perfect chocolate/banana flavor.
Doesn't need any frosting, just plain or some powdered sugar is perfect. I baked in a 13 X 9 inch pan for 35 minutes."
1230521,32082,4/10/2009,5,"yummiest cake ever!!!!!!!!.... turned out perfect, though i used half cup chocolate sauce and half cup evaporated milk instead of sour milk... 1/4 cup cocoa... 1cup white sugar n 1/4 cup brown sugar...topped it with cappuccino crunch chocolate frosting!.. just had it for breakfast again:D... n my hubby loved it too:)"
203674,32082,5/11/2009,5,"WOW!!!  This made a great Dora birthday cake for my daughter.   So moist even though I was a little short on the mashed banana.    I did use 3/4 tsp of banana extract and only 1/4 tsp of vanilla.  And instead of making my own sour milk I bought lowfat buttermilk.   As Dora would say ""Muy Muy Bien!"""
362546,32082,5/16/2009,5,"I really liked this! As did everyone who had some.  I mashed up 4 meduim sized bananas, but forgot to measure the right amount before putting it in(oopsie) but it still turned out really yummy! Thanks for this one, I will definitely make it again. :)"
344083,32082,6/22/2009,5,Loved this cake! I used butter instead of margarine and Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All-Purpose Baking Flour plus a 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum instead of the flour. You wouldn't even know it was a gluten free cake it turned out sooooo good! I served it with coconut milk ice cream and fresh fruit. Yum!
1313558,32082,8/18/2009,5,this is the way chocolate cake should taste...:)
851146,32082,8/20/2009,5,Awesome cake!  I was given a box of ripe bananas & wanted to do something a bit different & this recipe was perfect!  I made a cake for my brother in-law who ate the whole thing in a day because he couldn't stop himself from just another little slice... addict!  Thanks!!
879350,32082,9/15/2009,5,"Went to make this cake again and realized I have not rated it yet - SORRY!!! This cake is excellent and another great way to use up all those bananas!
I make it in a bundt pan and never frost it as it is perfect just the way it is!!
Thanks for sharing a great recipe."
1309408,32082,9/29/2009,5,"Excellent cake!  I had bananas that were getting brown so I looked for a banana cake recipe and found this one.  I made it yesterday and friends stopped by and one of them is NOT a sweets eater but had a piece anyway....he liked sooo much, he had seconds.  It is very moist and easy to fix."
73951,32082,11/10/2009,5,A delicious cake!  I baked in a  9 x 13 pan and dusted with icing sugar.    The top is very smooth and would be perfect for icing.  I will definitely make this again - thank you!
1471421,32082,12/9/2009,5,"This recipe is a winner! I baked it for my friend's birthday party and everyone came back for seconds! Except that I should have baked 2 instead... there weren't enough to go around for the second helpings. =)
I didn't have 2 cake pans of the same size, so I baked everything in a pan and cut the cake into 2 layers when cooled. And I made a filling with mashed bananas mixed with 1.5 teaspoon of lemon juice and some sugar. It gave the cake an extra ""omph"" and I had great feedbacks on that. Glad people noticed. 
Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!"
931663,32082,12/23/2009,2,"I followed the recipe exactly and I found it to be gross.. Sorry, I had high hopes bc the reviews were so good, but it was dry and tasted horrible.  Bummer"
1588002,32082,5/12/2015,5,This was great!!! I usually like straight banana cake and my wife loves chocolate cake; this recipe is better than either one alone. The flavors are well balanced and the texture came out great. The only thing I did different was baking it in a 13x9 which worked well at 40 min. A nice big hunk topped with whipped cream was a perfect dessert.
976718,32082,6/22/2010,5,"Wonderful.  Iced with the Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting by ""WaterMelon"".  Nice Combo.  Very moist, (perhaps Smaz overbaked?).  Dense, but still cake-y.  It was done in only about 33 minutes, as I used 9"" rounds.  Very banana-y, too, as I also used 3 large bananas, which came out to just over 1 1/2 cups.  My son wanted banana cake for his birthday and when I served this he panted with happiness and exclaimed, ""This is just what I wanted!"".  You could probably replace much of the butter (or margarine) with applesauce or some other fat replacement without noticing a difference.  I'll probably try that, next time, as I do with my banana bread."
1641892,32082,7/26/2010,0,"Delicious and moist and fudgey!  I used white whole wheat flour since It is what I had on hand, and substituted buttermilk for the sour milk.  Fantastic!"
953910,32082,8/15/2010,0,"DIVINE!  I have made this a couple of times now and it is soooo good.  I make a slab using a 9x13 and i don't ice it, just eat it as is (it's like a cakey brownie).  Served this evening with some vanilla ice cream and fresh strawberries, ohhh so heavenly!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe :)"
229052,32082,9/9/2010,5,"Positively love it!! Smelled so good I couldn't even wait for for it to cool to try it. Super chocolaty and moist and does not need any icing. Once it's cool enough I will dust it with powder sugar but I don't even know if it needs it. It has a slight crunch to the top, like a really good brownie would have. YUM, YUM, YUM!"
82227,32082,9/22/2011,4,I was looking for recipes to use up my sour milk and came upon this one.  I was a little hesitate that it would taste too banana-y but it really didn't.  The bananas really give it a nice moistness.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use real butter instead of the margarine.  I baked it in a 9 x 13-inch pan and frosted it with Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting (recipe #107376) .  Yum!  Nice combo.<br/>Thanks for sharing this recipe!
176615,32082,10/2/2011,5,"Delicious and moist! The entire family enjoyed this cake, even the boy who won't eat anything with bananas. Topped with a simple penuche frosting from recipe #125969 made by cooking 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 c butter, and 6 T milk in a saucepan, then stirring in 2 1/2  c powdered sugar. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
1313832,32082,7/29/2012,5,This cake is delicious. I had bananas in the freezer that were frozen and they went perfectly in this recipe. It is moist and chocalatey. I paired this with a chocolate butter frosting and my family loved it. Thanks for sharing.
2441656,32082,12/12/2012,5,I made this last night and it turned out great!   I didn't think it would puff up nice and pretty like a regular cake but it did!  I ended up with more like 1 1/2 cups banana and I used a box of instant chocolate pudding and 1/2 cup cocoa.  Very yummy and moist on it's own but i paired it with Top Secret Peanut Butter Frosting  Recipe #87058 which sent it over the top!
1526343,32082,2/24/2013,5,Really quite a lovely recipe. We made cupcakes instead of cake and baked them for 20 minutes at 350. My only other change was to use 1 cup buttermilk instead of 3/4 C. sour milk. Thank you for a great recipe.
2786907,32082,4/29/2013,5,Sooo good. I substituted butter for margarine and cooked it for about 35 minutes at 350 and it was a major hit.
2359704,32082,7/10/2013,5,"This recipe is great!  One small change I made was to use half a cup of butter and a quarter cup of non-fat yogurt.  Also added about a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon.  Okay, two changes.  Made it in a 9 x 13 and topped it with a white chocolate pudding frosting.  The gang at work loved it!  So moist and yummy.  Will definitely make again and again."
1179225,32082,12/4/2014,5,"Yummy cake! After tasting it, I decided we would wouldn&#039;t miss the icing and really wouldn&#039;t miss the calories. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe."
1803638808,32082,1/10/2015,5,"It was incredibly awesome! Well, I don&#039;t like it. I love it loaded. :) thank you for sharing. I made cake and cupcakes. Yumminess overload!"
2000713329,32082,11/26/2015,5,"It is almost scary how perfect, tasty and moist this cake is.  I was afraid the banana would make it dense but it didn&#039;t.   Awesome!!!"
1265628,32082,11/24/2016,5,"I did this as a bundt cake, and it was incredible! I also topped it with a simple glaze (icing sugar, milk and vanilla extract) which made it like a gigantic doughnut! 12/10 will do this again!"
2001341119,32082,1/7/2017,5,"This recipe is amazing. I made it as a bundt cake and baked it for about 50 minutes instead. I added pecans and later drizzled caramel and chocolate over it. Surprisingly the banana didn't overpower the chocolate and vice versa. However I didn't use sour milk, instead i used whole milk. Would definitely recommend this recipe to others."
2001940326,32082,1/18/2018,5,"Followed some of the comments on here and the cake turned out amazing. Added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, used whole milk instead of sour milk, and baked in a regular size bundt pan for 50 minutes at the suggested temp. Turned out incredibly moist yet spongy, with the chocolate and banana complimenting each other perfectly. The cayenne was just enough to peak through at the end. Kind of lost the cinnamon though, would maybe add another 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon to get the flavor of it just right. Will definitely make again!"
2001805056,32082,1/28/2018,5,"This was amazing. It had great flavor and texture. I didn't even bother with frosting the first time, but I might get some on the second time."
2002142414,32082,5/9/2018,0,AWESOME! Made it for a church function as a 13&quot; x 9&quot; with chocolate buttercream icing. it was the talk of the event! will make again
2002181810,32082,6/10/2018,5,"When I made this (for a colleague's leaving) it was nowhere near cooked at the time - took closer to an hour. But the next day when I saw the people who ate it I got so much kudos and requests for this cake everytime! Easy to make, and went down a treat apparently (I missed out)!"
21487,32279,1/20/2003,5,What a great change of pace! I had 3 racks of baby backs and wanted to cook each differently. I used your recipe for one of the racks (the other 2 I did hot and spicy). They turned out so good. I did not marinade over night but it still was wonderful. Thanks!
120040,32279,6/21/2004,0,It was a little bland for my taste. I will make again but will add red pepper flakes to give it a little extra punch.
47510,32279,3/22/2005,5,"Even though I forgot to marinate these overnight, but they still came out great.  We really enjoyed the taste of the ribs and I loved the ease of preparation.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
21752,45539,11/12/2002,5,"The minute I saw these posted I had to try them, especially since I was really jetlagged and had to occupy myself with something constructive at 4 in the morning.  I made these with a mix of walnuts, whole almonds and pecans.  WOW (caps intended)!!!  The mix of spicy and sweet is addictive.  I'm going to make a batch just to chop them up and mix into vanilla ice cream, it should be mind-blowing!  Ginny, I'm so glad I got you hooked on spiced nuts, just so you could find this one for me!  A thousand thanks!"
60221,45539,12/7/2002,5,"YUMMY!!! Oh my goodness, these nuts were so delicious. I made a double batch and the were demolished during the Thanksgiving holidays. The sugar-spice taste is to die for. I printed off copies of the recipe and gave them out to everyone. We think this is a winner. Thanks."
647466,86940,9/16/2009,4,This was very good.
25784,45539,12/10/2002,5,"5 stars x 1000. OMG these are simply AWESOME!!!! My husband and I used to take a road trip every season to see a minor league hockey team in Huntsville AL. They served a sugar-spiced walnut at the games and we would buy several bags and bring them home because they were so good. I have not found them anywhere else, and that team no longer exists, so we have really been missing those nuts, until now! These are pretty darn close and have become our favorite nuts. Ginny, your instructions are first rate. The recipe was very easy to follow and the results were just perfect. I have only tried a few times in the past to make spiced nut with very poor results(TRASH CAN). Your step by step instructions made it so easy. I also tried this with pecan halves. Just delicious. Only change with the pecans, I added 1/8 tsp more salt, as I have found fresh pecans to need a little more salt. Thanks so very much for posting this recipe."
44642,45539,3/7/2003,5,"WE have 11 walnut trees..so always looking for nut recipes. this is without a doubt the best for just nuts..and YES they are very addictive,just can not stop eating them.thank You..thank You.. Mirj.
"
2312,45539,4/2/2003,5,I made 3 different types of nuts for Christmas gift-giving and this one was by far my favorite.  Really savory...  Had the last little baggie this week!
41706,45539,6/25/2003,5,"This one got rave reviews in my home! :) I mixed all the nuts I had on-hand (walnuts, almonds, AND pecans - and made this recipe today. I'm thinking they may disappear into DH's lunch tomorrow - I won't be surprised if they're ""missing"" from my kitchen! Thanks for sharing!"
10033,45539,12/10/2003,5,"Oh my GOD, these are such a winner!! I have never made spiced nuts before--I just made a few to send to my fiance's family for christmas gifts. They are truly delicious--not oily at all, and really complex-tasting with the allspice/nutmeg/salt/coriander/cinnamon/pepper combo. I did use kosher salt--I think normal iodized salt would bring down the quality of the recipe. Also used real vanilla--can't imagine using the fake junk. Really terrific, GinnyP, although I have yet to hear from the future ILs! "
50472,45539,12/17/2003,5,Good Stuff!
37183,45539,1/14/2004,5,"I made these twice this Christmas season - once as written, and once substituting ""birch sugar"" (also known as Xylitol) for the granulated sugar, as requested by my diabetic father in law. Both turned out well. I had to bake them close to an hour, but I'm sure that's due to me making them in a tabletop roaster oven rather than a ""normal"" oven, coz that's what I've got at the moment. I loved the subtle spices and vanilla combined with the light sweetness & crunch. Thanks for sharing, Ginny!"
55729,45539,4/2/2004,5,"What else can I add? Easy and yummy, and worked exactly as directed."
160345,45539,10/8/2004,5,Wow!!! These are great.  I made the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully.  Thanks
121354,45539,10/18/2004,4,"These nuts were very good, and quite easy.The spices did not distribute as well as I would have hoped when I stirred the nuts, but they still tasted great."
148323,45539,2/21/2005,5,"These nuts were delicious. I added the seasonings to the sugar to help assure they distributed well (due to another person's comment in their review), and this worked great."
78808,45539,3/20/2006,5,"Wow -- I have been trying lots of different snack nut recipes for my husband's business trips... and this one has won out over all others.  It is just delicious and I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for posting this recipe!
Dianne"
68727,45539,11/13/2006,5,This was a great recipe and I will use it often since my grandpa is always giving me walnuts and I usually don't know what to do with them.  I received a lot of compliments about how good these walnuts tasted.  I really liked the subtle sweet spice taste.
370315,45539,12/18/2007,3,"It was okay. I left out the vanilla, so thats probaly why they didnt taste that good."
360437,45539,1/13/2008,5,Loved these! The only thing I changed was using canola instead of corn oil. It seemed to work just fine. Watch them closely while they're baking-they get overdone easily. Thanks!
95743,45539,2/2/2008,5,"These were terrific, everybody loved them and there were no leftovers.  Only change I made was to use grapeseed oil."
846829,45539,10/13/2008,5,"I'm updating this review.  I'm not a big nut eater, so at first these were just okay, but then they began to grow on me.  Now i love them! I think that they are especially good chilled."
88378,45539,12/24/2009,5,"My family goes ape for these nuts.  They are very very good, and the recipe is great with concise instructions.  We have these at the holidays and my older kids adore them.  Yum!"
126440,45539,3/21/2010,5,Loved the flavor.  I was helping DH in the basement so it was my fault that some of them were burned.  So do not go away they need to be checked on.  Will make these again soon but stay close.
98170,45539,9/10/2011,3,These were bland to us. I'm going to add some extra seasoning and see if the family will eat them.  They just aren't going as-is.
37449,54548,5/21/2005,5,"This was yummy and I served it with ice cream.Of course I used strawberries instead of the raspberries. It wasn't too sweet, just a little tart and went well with vanilla ice cream! Thanks CountryLady!"
566544,96886,1/8/2009,4,javascript:void(0)
89831,54548,10/27/2005,5,"So delicious! like Sharon123, I used frozen strawberries, made this well in advance and served it with vanilla ice cream tonight, what a great dessert, I'll make this again very soon, this is so yummy! thanks Marg!...Kitten:)"
82616,63059,6/24/2003,3,nummy :)
91453,63059,7/24/2003,4,"very moist, and because i didn't have any eggs in my fridge, so i like that it's eggless. i didn't have any blueberries so i added grated lemon peel, raisins and orange juice (instead of milk). yummy!"
96861,63059,8/2/2003,0,These muffins were very good.  The use of yogurt makes them nice and moist and fat-free too !!
126764,63059,2/19/2004,3,"it was so moist and tasty, din't have muffin cups so I baked it as a cake used strawberries instead turned out surprisingly well "
135771,63059,4/29/2004,2,"The muffins were very chewy, and a funny texture. i followed the recipe exactly. Edible, but wouldn't make them again"
124050,63059,6/1/2005,5,"I thought these were absolute great, everyone that had one loved them!"
343981,63059,11/29/2006,4,"These are very good!  The first time I made them, I made some changes, like using whole wheat flour instead of white, and they turned out a little chewy.  The second time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly, and they were yummy!  Thanks!"
104295,63059,6/25/2007,4,"Not the prettiest muffins I ever made as the middles all fell.  And 1/2 cup of blueberries seems way too low for us as many of the muffins only had a very few blueberries in them.  That said, they have a lovely taste with almost no fat.  Plenty sweet, I'd make these again but add more fruit!  Oh, I used a white/wheat blend that worked just fine."
87023,63974,6/22/2003,5,This is the time when you realise simple can be best. This is a really delicious healthy tasty meal.  I used mesculan salad leaves as I already had them in the fridge. Will definitely do it again.
93446,63974,8/10/2003,5,This was absolutely delicious!  I wasn't able to get any arugula so I used romaine lettuce as I had some on hand.  I found the lemon vinaigrette a little bland but it could be simply because I used another type of salad green.  I'll definitely make this recipe again!
39835,63974,7/29/2005,4,Super easy way to make veal chop. I made the marinade in the morning before work and threw them on the grill when I got home. We added some feta cheese to the salad and served it along side the veal. Thanks for sharing!
1284443,63974,5/11/2012,5,Only made the chops and marinated for six hours.  Used a little more garlic and evoo (not necessary to) and added some red pepper flakes for heat.  It's simple and delicious.
86318,67208,9/5/2004,5,"The chocolate and orange flavors mixed in the ice cream were just delicious. I made a batch of Dairy Queen Ice Cream Copycat recipe #32963 by AnnaCG, and combined approximately 2 cups ice cream with 1/4 of the amounts of the other ingredients. I may have gotten too much ice cream (if there is such a thing), but this was more of a dessert than a drink. I'm not! complaining. 1/4 of the recipe should have yielded 2 servings, but I'm not talking. Thank you for the recipe."
1193707,111937,6/26/2011,5,"This was delicious--my husband said it was the best (chicken) chili he has ever eaten! I didn't have beer, so used dry white wine. I actually cooked the chicken with the spices and the crushed tomatoes--did not want to use tomato sauce.  I added one bay leave and cooked my own beans, then added to the chili when ready. Thanks for sharing this easy, delicious recipe. Will make it often! (For the people who like it more spicy, like my husband: add hot sauce to your dish or increase the chili.)"
26652,138396,9/30/2005,5,I haven't tried this yet but it sounds to die for!  Thanks for the great idea.
185105,138396,2/17/2006,5,"This is undoubtedly the BEST meatloaf sandwich I've ever tasted! It's one of those ""I can't believe I didn't think of that"" recipes...The grilling makes it perfect, and the cheese gets gooey and yummy!  The combination of the grainy mustard and ketchup gives it just the right amount of flavor.  (Reminds me of an old fashined ""patty melt"" which is a favorite of mine.)  I will never eat meatloaf sandwiches ANY OTHER WAY!  Thank you so much for sharing this!  :)"
119466,138396,12/17/2006,5,"Great sandwich! I subbed Provolone for the Monterey Jack, lightly sprayed olive oil on the bread and grilled the sandwiches panini style in a George Foreman grill. Thanks for posting the recipe!"
605952,138396,10/5/2007,3,It was okay. I liked it except for the pickles. They seemed to upstage the sandwich. I ended up picking them off the 2nd half.
616888,138396,10/16/2007,5,"Wow, this is an incredibly delicious recipe. My mom made meatloaf and I was looking for a way to jazz up leftover sandwiches and this is definitely the way to do so. 5 stars."
305503,138396,1/6/2008,5,This was a very yummy sandwich that the whole family enjoyed. We used provolone cheese and liked it a lot. Meatloaf sandwiches didn't sound appealing at first but this recipe changed my mind - I will now look forward to leftover meatloaf!
452606,138396,3/22/2008,5,"Wow, delicious!  i added mayo to one slice of my sandwich (because I love mayo).  My hubby loved it as well."
302094,138396,10/19/2009,5,I just had this for lunch. I had leftover meatloaf from dinner and didn't know what to do with it. This was fantastic. I had mine with pepper jack cheese. Thanks for a great lunch!
182010,171213,6/12/2006,5,"Having seen Charbear's photo and review, I copied what she did and piped the mixture on to crostini made from pumpernickel bread.  We enjoyed it very much.  Thank you, Mrs. Goodall!"
1230396,138396,5/8/2010,0,"Oh, my! Never knew a meatloaf sandwich could be so scrumptious. I was searching for something interesting to do with some leftover meatloaf and found this recipe. Usually just threw the sliced meatloaf between two slices of bread - very boring. From now on, I'll be looking forward to the leftovers! Thanks for sharing this!"
159317,138396,7/22/2011,5,"This recipe is so easy and versatile.  I found it looking for a new way to use up leftovers.  Yum!  Sometimes we substitute bottled barbecue sauce for the ketchup.  You can use any cheese and any bread.  It's good on ""artisan"" breads from my grocery store, such as the cheese bread or olive/rosemary loaf.  Be creative.  It's a no-fail winner."
394617,183623,8/6/2007,4,This is very good. I first found on in the Emeril Prime Time cookbook.  I was going to post it but then I saw it hear.  It's a real keepr.  I will be making it agian for the holidays.
514331,198160,10/8/2007,4,"Yummy! I loved the airy texture of the bread, and the ease to put together. Really good hot out of the oven with a cold glass of milk. I will make this again!"
400708,198160,10/21/2007,4,"Had this for breakfast hot out of the oven and then the next day for left overs.  Easy to put together and taste great.  Loved the smell of it baking in the oven.  Enjoyed by all even my picky DGSs.  DH has already requested it again.  Thanks Nonnie, it will be made agaon."
204024,198160,11/19/2007,5,This is great! It was enjoyed by a group of 20 year old boys at my house tonight.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Would definitely make this again.  Made for Market Tag 2007
1221917,198160,4/7/2010,3,"This was very easy to make, and it was certainly delicious. However, it dried out extremely quickly despite being stored in an airtight container. Later the same day it was made it was already drying out, and within two days it was too dried out to even finish it. I think this is more suited for when you have enough people around to eat it all right away while it's still warm from the oven. I'll make it again for sure, but when it'll be finished right away rather than having leftovers."
269480,349984,4/16/2009,5,This tastes delicious! I love the crunchy outside and the tender juiciness inside as I take each bite. The seasoned breadcrumbs combined with butter/garlic/lemon blended really well.  Thank you for sharing! Made for Spring PAC 2009.
2000835645,349984,1/24/2016,5,My husband and our kids enjoyed this recipe. Thank you?
2000395428,349984,2/2/2016,0,Made this tonight. It was delishious!!
1741243,472362,4/28/2015,1,"I am not vegan/vegetarian, but was looking for a recipe that used ingredients on hand. I made it according to the recipe, without the salt or cheese options. I found it to be tasty, but  really salty. Aside from the olives, which  I did use, I can&#039;t think of any foods called for that seem salty. I also like green olives, so I was surprised. I only have access to green olives in brine, so maybe a different type or rinsing them would help. I ate one serving."
7119,8905,11/2/2001,0,A very nice change from the usual tomato based spaghetti sauce.
59064,8905,2/18/2004,4,A very nice quick easy meal when you are in a hurry and you need something nutritious. Enjoyed by everyone.
134917,8905,3/29/2004,3,"I used rotini pasta and omited the dried basil (the fresh basil is rather strong).  I thought that it was a bit bland at first, but much better with pecarino romano cheese on top.  It was fast to cook and it was colorful.   "
567212,8905,10/16/2007,2,"To me there seemed to be too many noodles, I had to add pasta sauce then it was much better."
18660,18139,7/26/2006,5,"This is perfect for a delicious quick fix dinner and inexpensive too.  We used our stove top instead of microwaving the meal, yummy just the same."
31460,23244,4/18/2002,4,My kids ate cauliflower! (WITHOUT threat of bodily injury as an enticement) The only other way they would eat it is when I crumbled it and buried it carefully in some other dish so that they didn't know they were eating it. This is a milestone.
256795,23244,3/18/2010,5,"Yum!  I really  liked this!  My hubby spiced his up, but that's pretty typical.  I did cut way back on the oil and increased the vinegar...yum!!"
498271,48665,12/10/2007,4,"These cookies are yummy!  I had a little trouble with the making of them but I got it worked out:  I added about 1/2 cup more flour, then let the ""dough"" sit and cool a while.  I then made balls of dough and flattened them out, then baked them.  I had to let them cool for longer than 30 seconds to be able to roll them.  Once I got the hang of it they were very easy!  The dip in the melted chocolate really adds a nice touch!  Thanks for posting!"
48834,62125,12/20/2004,5,This was incredibly fantastic. The flavors meld so well together. I will be making this again!
217360,62125,4/4/2007,4,This is very tasty. I had to substitute orange juice for the lemon (my lemon was very much past its best). Wasn't entirely sure what to expect and felt dubious about the amount of custard until I saw the gingerbread puff up and make the area to be filled with custard much smaller.
735593,62125,10/8/2009,1,We didn't really care for this unfortunately.  And I was very confused about the flan part? I love flan and this didn't resemble flan at all...
220348,62125,10/5/2010,5,This was a great flan and I enjoyed it immensely. I just love the ginger taste in this. Thank you for a great flan.
98459,66248,1/2/2004,5,I was amazed at the simplicity of this dish and the taste was wonderful.  I made it for my mother's birthday and it was a hit. 
6357,87294,3/23/2004,5,These are very easy and tasty cookies. Very enjoyable! Thanks for sharing!!
117396,87294,3/24/2004,0,"I made these for my son who told me 2 hours before scouts that he needed cookies (isn't that just like a 14-yr old).  I had just looked at the recipes posted today and knew I had all the ingredients for these.  I did add pecans.  I kept one cookie each for my DH and I.  They reminded me of the ""Chunky"" candy bar I ate as a teenager.  Next time I'll make the whole batch for us.  Quick and easy.  "
141606,87294,5/16/2004,5,"My new step-daughter and I made these for a school project on Germany!  Ya know ""german chocolate"" is German right?? We thought so!! They were delicious!!

Pat & Katie Del Greco 5/16/04"
4439,87294,7/19/2004,5,"I made these for a cake sale @ work. I did not have chocolate chips or raisines, but I did have Raisinettes, so I used them. The cookies were the first thing to sell out!! An enormous hit! This ia keeper!!!!"
201581,87294,12/19/2006,5,"Wow, this was so easy. I'm definitely keeping this one to make again. I used 1/2 cup nuts and 1/2 cup chocolate chips with the raisins. They taste like the Cadbury fruit & nut bar. Made for Alphabet Soup Game. Thanks for posting DDW!"
339260,328120,12/6/2008,5,"What a great way to serve pork chops.  I used a mixture of white and wheat dry bread cubes.  I couldn't find any plain bread cubes so I chose the one with sage and omitted using the sage in the recipe.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written (using about an additional 1/2 cup of chicken broth in the stuffing).  The pork chops were tender and moist and he stuffing was delicious.  Thanks for another great recipe, MarthaStewartWanabe.  Made for December, 2008 Aussie/NZ Swap."
632249,328120,2/20/2009,5,"Wonderful pork chops!  Just as you promised, warm and hearty comfort food. I followed as written except that I used about 1 1/4 C broth in the stuffing as we like it crispy. The bottom stuffing still turned out soft for the kids who like it that way. I will definitely be making this again, thx for posting."
131674,335958,12/9/2008,4,While I loved the finished product's taste I couldn't get them to stay together when I pinched them at the top!  Therefore I forgot to sprinkle them with sesame seeds (darn!).  Next time I think I might try to keep them together with a toothpick.  The taste was excellent.  Made for Photo Tag.
171790,335958,12/12/2008,5,"These are very tasty. As a previous reviewer, I couldn't get them to stay together when I pinched them closed. Maybe a bit of water would help? Made for PRMR tag."
226863,335958,12/14/2008,5,"Delicious!  After getting KateL's permission, I used frozen puff pastry dough.  I did get all but two of mine to stick together, and I didn't use water.  These were delicious, and I think the puff pastry made them extra light and fluffy.  I will definitely be making these again!  Thanks for posting the recipe.  Made for Zaar 123-4 Tag!"
736554,335958,4/5/2009,5,We really enjoyed these.  I did have a bit of a challenge getting mine to stay together but it doesn't matter because they taste great.  I had about 3/4 cup of feta and 1/4 cup of cheddar.  Mine baked in 11 minutes; bottoms were done.  I did not garnish with sesame seeds.  Thanks Kate!  Made for win in The Best of 2008 Cookbook Swap.
1776291,335958,2/7/2011,5,These were great.  I will definitely make again.
254614,379503,6/29/2009,4,"I love it! I put in ice cube trays with  double handle picks used for appetizers. I will spray Pam the next time I make though.  Then they will pop right out. My popscicle molds went to my kids.
I think it would be nice to put a little sweetened cocoa mix powder with it for mocha cream
cicles."
345852,379503,8/1/2009,5,"Saw this on the David Lebowitz blog as well and have been meaning to try it out. I did last night - loved this icy treat. And I had no trouble getting the popsicles out of the mould. 
Will be making again :D"
1468949,392639,12/14/2009,4,Surprisingly delicious (tastes even better the next day).  I'm not keen on Lima beans so substituted Chickpeas.  I'd omit the additional salt next time.
381180,460441,12/29/2012,5,"This was delicious, and I will make it again!  I didn't know what to expect because I've never used curry powder before ~ I sorta winged the lemongrass amount, because my lemongrass came in a tube!  I left out the fish, and made it with shrimp only, and added some water chestnuts.  I loved the finish with the lime juice and basil ~ Tagged for Auzzie Recipe Swap #71.- December 2012."
2324285,460441,2/26/2013,4,"I liked this.  Of all the Asian cuisines, I am most unfamiliar with Vietnamese food.  This turned out to be a nice change of pace from the usual Thai, Japanese, and Korean food I make.  The flavor wasn't as strong as I expected, so I added more fish sauce.  I also would've liked to have used more lemongrass, or tossed in some kafir lime leaves near the end.  Overall, quite good- thanks for sharing! [Made and reviewed for BEST OF 2012]"
2597942,513016,5/11/2014,4,"Made these cookie bars this afternoon to take to the neighbors cook-out / bon-fire this evening. These were very easy to put together and the flavor was pretty tasty. The texture was a bit strange, but I&#039;m assuming that is because it uses a cake mix. I will try making these again, and maybe skip the walnuts next time. Thanks for posting. (Made for PAC 2014)"
3678,3063,11/28/2000,4,"It was a good recipe, but I felt it needed a little garlic. My son said it was just like he had it in a restaurant. (which in our neighborhood is a great restuarant).  Bravo great stuff."
39949,16573,7/21/2003,5,"OH, my!  I'd been wanting to make this for almost a week, and due to some stuff life threw us, had the chicken marinated, but had to freeze it, and then thaw it to be cooked.  Therefore, it marinated about 1 1/2 days before it was frozen.  I made it exactly as directly, and since I had to thaw it, and it was still frozen in spots, I cooked it a bit longer (probably about 1 more turn, or 19-15 minutes longer).  Boy, was it ever exceptional!  It was moist, crispy, and totally infused with the garlic and lemon flavors.  We had it simply, with corn and biscuts, and I can hardly wait to take the leftovers to work for lunch tomorrow.  I thought this was incredibly easy (we broiled it rather than grilled it, as I'd thought we would).  Just wonderful, Mirj!  DH said ""spectacular"" when I asked him what he thought.  He's already asked for a repeat this weekend - the hallmark of a wonderful recipe to us!  "
26075,16573,7/26/2003,5,I made this using a family pack of chicken legs.  I had to increase cooking time because the legs were so big.  These turned out wonderful and they were so moist. The recipe is easy and quick.  The fresh squeezed lemon was great and not over-powering like the bottled stuff.  It reheated pretty great (I made them for the Sabbath) but they were better fresh out of the oven.  I will definitely make them again.  I did use more garlic just because I love it.  Thanks for the recipe.
64472,16573,3/1/2005,5,This is an easy and delicious recipe.  I also added cumin and turmeric to the marinade.  Gave the chicken beautiful color and added flavor.
195614,16573,5/4/2006,5,This has become a staple of our household.  I usually cook the marinated chicken out on the bar-b-que.  We LOVE it!
68460,16573,1/24/2008,5,"My family loved this.  I had to bake it for part of it's cooking time because I had Ev's Greek potatoes going in the oven at the same time.  Once those were done, I turned the oven to broil and broiled for the rest of the cooking time.  We had roasted asparagus as a side.  Excellent dinner, thanks Mirj!"
157785,16573,4/14/2008,4,"Made this over the weekend and it was superb. I used skinless boneless breasts and cooked a little too long, but it was still very, very tasty. Next time I will use pieces but I used what was on hand this time. Heated up leftovers for a scrumptious chicken sandwich the next day. Will be a regular staple at our house. Thx Mirj for another great recipe!"
442311,16573,5/6/2008,4,Chicken was moist - very good on a salad
309526,16573,8/16/2008,5,"I had a huge package of chicken wings and large crowd to feed.  This was THE dish!  I marinated the wings for 12 hours in the lemon juice, garlic, pepper and olive oil, then baked them at 350 degrees F for one hour.  Awesome blend of flavors.  Even my DH who has had enough chicken to sprout feathers himself enjoyed these tremendously and looks forward to an encore!  Thanks, Mirj!"
1239906,16573,11/24/2009,5,I didn't think broiled chicken could taste so good.  Bravo!
23302,17083,1/17/2002,4,"Great recipe, polly. On my next batch though, I'm going to add more banana and a smidgen of banana extract for a little more distinct banana flavour. I made them as muffins and they were done after about 45 minutes. I took about 1/2 of them, along with a stick of butter, to work and left them by the coffee maker. They were gone within an hour."
27783,17083,1/21/2002,5,"This bread recipe is excellent!  It was indeed very, very moist and has a wonderful flavor.  I used really, really over-ripe bananas and I added 1/2 tsp. banana extract.  If you make the loaf rather than muffins, allow the bread to cool a bit in the pan first - it smelled so good that I just couldn't wait for it to cool.  When I tried to take the still warm loaf out of the pan, it split in half because it is so tender. We dug in anyway - and is was delicious!  A real keeper."
18391,17083,2/12/2002,5,"Mmmmmmm ... I made muffins (complete recipe: 18), baked them for 25 minutes ... I also added banana extract ... thanks, this one is a keeper!!"
31316,17083,2/19/2002,4,I am new to this site and this is the first recipe I tried.  I had a few sorry-looking bananas in the house and needed to use them.  We really enjoyed this bread.  It is nice and moist and it has a buttery flavor.  I omitted the nuts but it turned out great.  I do have another banana bread recipe I use but I will alternate it with this one if I have sour cream in the house.  It's a keeper.
8688,17083,3/5/2002,5,"This is without a doubt 5 STAR Banana Bread.  Very moist and flavorful. I used 4 small, very ripe bananas, and needed no additional flavoring.  I've tried many banana bread recipes and this one very well be the best I've tried!  Don't tell my Mom!!  ;)"
28671,17083,3/26/2002,5,"Moist!  No, dripping moist!  Wonderful flavor, texture.  Baked up nicely as a loaf of bread.  I used a little more banana and pecans.  I think I'll toast the pecans before I add them next time.
Great recipe, Polly!"
34687,17083,3/26/2002,5,"This is a wonderfully moist banana bread. I made it last night and when I came into the kitchen this morning HALF of it was already gone. Its a good thing I have some more over ripe bananas, because i can see i am going to have to make some more tonight! Thanks so much for posting."
29920,17083,4/2/2002,4,Yummy is right.Simple to make and it has a wonderful flavor.Will make again for gifts and company.Thanks!!!!
36780,17083,4/8/2002,0,"It is really easy to make and it tastes ""yummy"",but for some unknown reason, mine fell.  I've never had anything fall on me.  I followed that recipe exactly as above, so it's hard to make a comment when it didn't turn out like it should have."
38334,17083,4/17/2002,5,Tossed everything in the Breadmaker and 1 hr and 50 minutes later it was done. Great texture and taste.  Added 1/2 t of pumpkin pie spice and increased the walnuts.  It was a little brown but it did not affect the flavor.
26723,17083,5/14/2002,5,"This is by far the best banna bread we have had. It is very easy to make. It browns up very nicely when cooked. Tryed it first in a loaf and the very next day we made another batch in mini muffins for the kids lunches.....Yummy is right !!  UPDATE: A hint for Banana Bread lovers such as myself. I was recently over at my sisters house and while getting Ice cubes for a drink I saw Whole frozen Bananas in her freezer. This is a great idea when you only have one or two bananas left. Throw them in the freezer ( with peel on ) , collecting them until you get around to making the bread. No more waste of bananas in our house. We made a batch yesterday from the frozen ones and it was equally as good as using fresh bananas."
33823,17083,5/27/2002,5,"This a great recipe, and it sure is Yummy banana bread, a great way to use up those black banana. I have made in large loaf, and mini loaf pan. And both have turned out great, Thank you ."
49304,17083,9/5/2002,5,"YUMMY,YUMMY, the best Banana that I have ever made. I've made a lot of Banana Bread, I've been married for 55 years,also, had child Day Care. Moist,Tasty, you name it, It is GREAT. I doubled the recipe. made 2 loaves plus 6 muffins added Choclate chips to the muffins.Yummy.
Thank you for the recipe will be making this again soon."
38647,17083,9/9/2002,5,"This recipe was fantastic.Yummy, yummy I have made this for every family gathering we have, and there are alot of them.Everyone should try this recipe.I also added banana extract 2 tsps. to be exact."
23701,17083,12/2/2002,5,"This is by far the best banana bread I have ever tasted, and everyone that has tried it is in agreement on this.  I have made it 4 times and have tried things differently each time.  I found that the best way to get a smooth consistency of the bananas is to add all liquid/soft ingredients first, then add all dry ingredients.  I also have been adding chopped cashews instead of walnuts.  It is fabulous!!!"
65166,17083,12/29/2002,5,This is the BEST banana bread I have ever had! It smelled wonderful while cooking and tasted even better. Very moist and delicious. Thank you!
10701,17083,1/9/2003,5,"Found this fab. Left out the nuts. Very moist Made 6 muffins as well as loaf, and only cooked for 30min. Will definately do again."
27395,17083,1/19/2003,4,"This was a very good banana bread, but it didn't ""knock my socks off"". I used chopped walnuts, sprinkled a little over the top, along with some cinnamon. I think some cinnamon in the batter would have made this even tastier, which I will do next time. It is a very moist bread, though...really yummy with a little bit of cream cheese spread over top:)
Thanks for posting

28628,17083,1/20/2003,5,"This is the best banana bread I have ever had.  It was easy to make and tasted great.  My family ate the whole loaf and begged me to make more.  I did not have any nuts to put in but my family didn't mind. This was great. Thank you .

70907,17083,3/3/2003,5,"Yummy is right!  This is the best Banana bread ever.  I made it yesterday afternoon and it is almost gone.  The only problem I see is I can't stop at one slice.

Thanks for sharing!  Sherry"
66899,17083,3/5/2003,5,"yummy is the word!  i made a few substitutions- molasses and rice syrup for the sugar, 1/2 whole wheat flour, cottage cheese instead of sour cream and added a little apple sauce.  so basically it wasn't the same recipe at all but a great inspiration!  i made mini muffins for my boys and they loved them.  thanks!"
123294,17083,1/24/2004,5,Great recipe!  My family loved it.  It was really easy to make. I just added a little cinnamon to it. It is really moist.
68938,17083,3/28/2004,5,"I use just a regular sized loaf pan to make this recipe. At first, I thought it wouldn't turn out at and because after the hour baking time, it was still really uncooked inside. I was disappointed and just left it in the oven and went to bed.  In the morning, I expected a messy clean-up, but to my surprise, the banana bread turned out perfect!!  It was so moist on the inside, and the little surprise bonus was that the top crust was sticky like honey! I make this recipe about 2-3 times a week and everytime I make it, I start at night and leave it in the oven and wake up to the perfect banana bread!!"
25455,17083,7/13/2006,3,"The bread took more like an hour and a half to cook enough that a cake tester came out clean (enough).  The loaf looked lovely when it came out of the oven but as it cooled it sunk about an inch over all.  I sliced it when it cooled completely and was disappointed that the bottom half of the loaf still appeared to be undercooked and soggy.  The flavor was good, however."
320843,17083,7/20/2006,5,"Very moist, I love it, but my baking time wasn't quiet an hour, so who can tell??"
230258,17083,12/26/2006,5,"I have tried alot of banana breads, but this was the most delcious banana bread I have ever made! Full of flavor and very moist! Mine cooked for exactly an hour and it made the house smell heavenly! I will be making this very often! Thanks for the recipe polly salama!"
31550,17083,4/22/2007,5,"I have used the same banana bread recipe forever, but yesterday I decided to try this one because it had honey and sour cream in it - both of which I had on hand and wanted to use.  And, oh my goodness, WOW - this is my new banana bread recipe!  This is the moistest, yet not gooey, banana bread EVER!  I made it as a loaf and cooked 1 hr 10 mins and it was absolutely perfect."
598148,17083,9/26/2007,5,Just amazing cupcakes this makes!!! Thank you for having this on here for us to use!
192972,17083,11/12/2007,5,"So very good!  I used part wheat flour, Splenda instead of sugar, Smart Balance instead of butter, added some coconut flavoring, used only 1/2 t. salt, but added a whole cup of Walnuts.  My favorite bananas bread recipe now!"
130663,17083,1/30/2008,5,"Great bread,will make again."
105780,17083,2/1/2008,5,made this for brunch today subsituited splenda for sugar and it was enjoyed by all nice and moist
729064,17083,2/18/2008,5,"This bread was so moist and tasty, people at work were taking it from me. I want to buy some old banana's just to make this again. Thanks!"
804329,17083,6/1/2008,4,I used half whole grain flour and brown sugar. I didn't realize what a difference it would make until I made it completely according to recipe... but using brown sugar and whole grain I thought this was the best bread I ever tasted! Thanks for sharing!
441981,17083,10/24/2008,5,"This was one of the most delicious quick breads I have ever had. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour 1/2 unbleached and plain yogurt instead of sour cream. The bananas I used were almost black (I had frozen super ripe bananas) and I used 3. It made for a very moist, flavorful bread."
71772,17083,11/30/2008,5,"I made this recipe as muffins (18) this morning.  My alterations include using light butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 cup whole-wheat flour, 1/2 cup white flour, 3 medium bananas (was a bit more than 1 cup), and fat free sour cream.  They came out very moist and with so much banana flavour I didn't miss any spice like cinnamon. I will try as a loaf next time with nuts."
165064,17083,7/10/2009,0,"Annetta -  I have made quite a few different Banana Bread Recipes and this is by far the best I have found.  it is moist and has a wonderful banana taste.  The whole family loves it. I can hardly keep them away until it cools so I can cut it. Excellent Recipe Polly! THANK YOU!

278639,17083,8/29/2009,5,"MMMM---very good banana bread!!!   I added 1/2 tsp of banana flavoring as suggeted by a previous reviewer, but it really did not require it.   Thanks for sharing this recipe."
720912,17083,9/20/2009,5,I made this with some frozen bananas: I defrosted the 2 bananas in the microwave-then I mixed this all up in the kitchenaid-I used a glass pyrex loaf pan and I baked it for 60 minutes. I was sure to check my oven thermometer because my oven is off temperature alot of the time( its an old oven)-and I recommend that anyone who had trouble with this recipe make sure that their oven is really 350 degrees! Also I had sprayed the pan with nonstick first so that I could cool the bread out of the pan-The banana bread came out wonderful! Thanks Polly.
1634772,17083,6/16/2010,5,Wow!  I finally found the best recipe for banana bread.  It is amazingly moist and the flavor is better than any I've ever had.  I also have made it without butter and substituting lowfat vanilla yogurt instead.  So yummy and really low fat that way!
141756,17083,9/29/2010,5,The only banana bread recipe I ever use!
2000779473,17083,12/27/2015,5,Good recipe.  I used bread flour instead of all purpose.  I also used fat free sour cream.  I tripled the batch and it made 10 mini loafs.  They still took 60 minutes to bake.  Will definitely make again.
36344,17083,2/2/2018,5,Great way to get my banana bread fix!
780172,169034,7/10/2008,3,"I was excited about this recipe and then when I made it I was slightly disappointed. It just needs something to pep it up some, thought the salsa would do that, but it still lacked something. Like the idea of sweet potatoes and eggs, so will keep trying."
290201,26523,4/27/2008,4,"This was very good. I can never follow any recipe to the letter, even the first time I make it, so here is what I did differently: I only had one pound of scallops, but the recipe still worked out well. I also did not have any white wine, so I searched for a substitution and used 1/4 cup lemon juice in the sauce for the casserole. Since there were fewer scallops, I ended up with a lot of sauce left over, so I used it to cover the angel hair spaghetti I made to go with this. I will definitely be making this again, but probably with more scallops."
199848,26523,1/3/2009,4,"Very easy and has a nice flavor.  It doesn't specify what type of scallops, so I used bay scallops and it worked quite well.  The only issue I had is that the end result was very ""soupy.""  You need to consider that the mushrooms will release water as they cook.   I will certainly make this again, but next time I will cut the amounts of both the wine and cream in half.  Thanx!"
52448,56521,4/9/2003,5,"I hope you will have another romantic dinner again, as long a you share the recipe with us!
The only minor thing I did different was that I drained the spinach before adding the mozzarella, but then can depend on which type of spinach you have, some just have more water. I left out the chili pepper and used chicken stock instead of water and a cube. Lovely sauce and I served it on a bed of spinach as you suggested, and a little bit spaghetini."
104599,56521,8/29/2004,5,"From Jacksonville, USA   thanks for your receipe. I just made it and was extremely good, will definatly make it again. Your natural foods approach is very appealing to me, i'll check more of your receipes and probably will use a number of them. Only change i made was to not use the tomato paste (darn carb diet, lol) never the less had no effect on the outcome.
THanks again for sharing  ..."
61127,56521,5/25/2005,5,"This recipe is absolutely lovely!  At first glance, it seems kind of complicated, but it really isn't.  The flavor is just right - not too much & not too little of everything.  I did eliminate the jalapeno peppers, though.  

The first time I made it, the occassion was my boyfriend's birthday.  He actually said that this was one of the best dishes that I'd ever cooked for him (and I cook quite often)!  Needless to say, I'll be using this recipe again."
1148038,56521,1/28/2009,5,"I tried this recipe out as my very first SBD phase 1 dinner.  It was excellent!  I actually made this as it was, but also made a second filling made with chopped broccoli instead of spinach since my boyfriend doesn't like it.  It also turned out very well.  Served with a side of squash and zucchini sauteed in the juices from the chicken created a very tasty dinner!"
1134529,56521,10/17/2009,5,"This recipe is AWESOME!!  I made the recipe as it was written except used basil, garlic and oregano chopped tomatoes.  Thank you so much for the fantastic recipe!!!"
91317,92420,8/8/2004,5,I am not a big fan of ribs...made these because my husband loves them..they were WONDERFUL!!  I would decrease the salt to about 1 1/2 tbs. the next time and since the hot paprika was not to be found in my area I used a bit of cayenne pepper...they are really good and look like a picture! Thanks Lynnie!!
133174,112474,4/4/2005,5,"I'm with you Toni, I have oatmeal 3 to 4 times a week and am always on the lookout for new ways to fix it.  I used about half the ginger the recipe called for, old fashioned oats and added 1/3 cup dry milk powder with the oats and water to make a creamier texture.  Served it topped with brown sugar.  This is a winner!"
104295,112474,4/18/2005,5,"I have to admit that my first 2 bites of this were tenative.  But then I realized how very good this is!  I halved the recipe and used quick cooking oats.  I also chopped the peaches into small pieces.  And I topped with a splash of low fat vanilla soymilk.  Very nice.  I know that, for work reasons, I will miss lunch today so I paired this with a fruit and yogurt smoothie for a nice hearty breakfast.  "
319738,171002,8/8/2006,4,"I used this marinade for 24 hours on 2"" think Iowa cut pork chops and broiled them for 10 minutes per side on a low broil.  This marinade gave a nice, light BBQ flavor and the chops were very juicy!  (Even after being in the freezer for 6 months!)  Next time, I will use thinner chops (but sometimes you just have to use what you have!)  With thinner chops, this would be a 5 * recipe :-)"
39835,171002,8/26/2006,4,"I picked this recipe to use up the remainder of a bottle of Southern Comfort and I'm glad I did. Even though I only marinated the 5 pork chops for 3 hours they were still delicious--I think if I marinated them the whole time, they would have been wonderfully flavorful and tender. Thanks for sharing!"
452045,40299,7/4/2012,5,"1 question Iowahorse, what sort of roast beast?<br/>This is a godd simple recipe."
211960,112474,5/12/2005,5,"Hi - oddly I didn't know this recipe was here and came up with a variant of this on my own but this is so close to how I prepared mine I felt obliged to say how delicious the combination of the oatmeal, yoghurt and peahces is, most especially with the ginger.  If you like peaches, oatmeal and ginger the combination is a sure winner however you prepare it :)  (Provided it's sweet! - honey sound like a wonderful idea!)  My variants were to empty the canned Peaches which were in syrup into a sieve and rinse them in water, then use part of the tin (fridged the rest) I squished a few segments (enough to put on top of the porridge) through my fingers into a pot to make a rough puree.  Also, I don't have any candied ginger  (I wish!) so I used 1/2 tsp ground ginger in the porridge with 1/4 to 1/3 tsp caraway seeds though I was dubious about them - they were great together!  I used a generous tsp plain/natural yoghurt and sprinkled sweetener across the top of the porridge with yoghurt on top then added the peach puree over the yoghurt, and sprinkled a bit more ground ginger for good measure (a bit too good a measure I think!).  I wonder if real Ambrosia could be better than this ! :) Soft Brown sugar over the tops sounds a heavenly idea too! Thanks for the excellent recipe suggestion. I'm not sure whether or not I should give a rating, but your recipe is so near identical to how I did it, and I know it's a knockout combination it's got to be worth 5 stars!"
56112,112474,6/13/2005,5,"I had to think about this one for a minute.  I just wasn't sure about the ginger taste, but then, the more I ate...the more I enjoyed this.  I did use fresh peaches and I also cut back a little on the ginger, because I just wasn't sure about it.  Great recipe that gives plain old oatmeal a new twist!!"
206722,112474,11/25/2005,4,"Like Jellyqueen, I wasn't too sure about the ginger...But she's right, the more you eat, the better it gets. "
64667,112474,8/28/2007,4,"Wow!  This was really good!   I am not very fond of oatmeal ordinarily, but this was really GOOD!   I LOVED the little bursts of ginger every so often, too.   I used fresh peaches (quartered, then chopped coarsely, so bigger chunks) and the flavors really came together nicely.   I used brown sugar and a bit of milk on mine--and that was a great breakfast.   *Made for Aus/NZ Recipe Swap Aug 07*"
486725,112474,1/25/2008,4,"Yes, this is a nice way to spice up your usual oatmeal! I used about a tsp of the crystallized ginger, and it still permeated the dish fully. I also used a couple of fresh nectarines on top. Nuts would probably go really well with this too. Thanks, Toni!"
143318,112474,3/16/2008,5,"Wonderful and sophisticated is the perfect description! The ginger flavor is quite strong, which I loved, but I imagine most people would want to use less. I cut the peach segments in thirds so they would be bite-sized. I cooked the oatmeal in the juice and that made it sweet enough without adding sugar. Thanks to Toni for sharing your creation!"
446143,112474,7/19/2008,5,"oh. my. gawsh.

used regular smooshed ginger, frozen (thawed) peaches."
37950,123478,11/29/2006,4,"These chicken breasts were super easy to make. We personally found the mustard taste to be overpowering, but a real fan of dijon mustard would probably love these! They certainly are a snap to put together, and nice enough for dinner guests too."
1344471,123478,10/21/2009,5,Great recipe! My kids love it? Super easy
130663,123478,1/29/2010,5,"Delicious,I cut back a bit on the mustard.."
286566,123478,5/28/2014,5,"I used thigh cutlets (bone in skin on) and only crumbed the top skin side and had enough mix to do 6 big thighs with 5 eaten and 1 left for sandwiches.  I baked them in a foiled lined and then lined with baking paper with clean up being a breeze and baked for 45 minutes at 175C fan forced for very crispy, moist and tasty chicken thoroughly enjoyed by the 3 of us.  Thank you Oolala made for Name that Ingredient."
1802763070,123478,5/28/2014,5,"I did this recipe over the Memorial day Holiday and it was a hit, I did make a couple of slight changes, we used honey mustard in place of the Dijon. I am a Thyme lover but also added a bit of sweet basil. I finished with a very slight gloss of tangy  BBQ sauce for Memorial day, my kids loved it."
67656,169034,4/13/2007,4,"While eggs and potatoes regularly appear on my breakfast plate, it never occurred to me to use sweet potatoes instead.  The results were delicious and filling.  I cut my leftover baked potato into smallish (3/8"") inch cubes and used a spicy chipotle salsa.  Garnish with a bit of chopped cilantro and some nonfat sour cream.  :) Thanks diwriter."
236532,169034,4/17/2007,4,This made a very good light dinner for me.  I love that it is designed for a single serving!  I used Mango-Lime salsa which was a great complement to the sweet potato.  Thanks for the recipe.
369264,169034,2/12/2008,3,This was only okay for me.  I'd probably cook the sweet potato in some olive oil and seasonings next time because they just seemed to be lacking a strong flavor on their own.  I'll experiment a bit more next time!
353659,171002,9/26/2006,5,"i had very little time to marinate these, b/c i just found the recipe today, and made it today.. anyway, they were awesome - we should have taken a picture b/c they were so pretty...  we used bone in pork chops - don't salt before putting them on the grill - this is a redundant step as there is plenty of sodium in the soy."
280271,171002,10/1/2006,5,"I have made this twice now. Excellent recipe! Both time's I have made it using Pork Tenderloins. I just love this. Everyone should try it. I marinated overnight. Comes out moist, juicy and tender with a wonderful flavor!Thanks, Kittencal for posting."
345110,171002,11/4/2006,1,"Maybe you need to use thick pork chops,but I used about 1/2 inch thick ones, marinated them longer than 12 hours and my husband didn't even know they were marinated and said they were tough. "
455010,171002,6/14/2007,5,"I used pork tenderloin, and marinated it over night.  It was easy to throw it on the grill.  What great flavors, and so tender.  I will make this again!!!!"
359899,171002,11/14/2007,5,"This is absolutely an OUTSTANDING recipe! I love it! and whenever I ask family when they come over if they want these marinated porkchops, they get excited, knowing that I use this recipe. Everyone I know that has tried this has always asked me for the recipe and told me to never stop making it. This recipe made me love pork chops again! Thank you so much for putting this recipe up.
(I even use it on Steaks!)
Stephanie Campeau"
348247,171002,11/19/2007,5,"Fabulous taste.  I used 2"" thick chops, followed directions by marinating then at least 12 hours in a plastic bag and then grilled them on the BBQ.  The chops were very tender and very tasty.  My husband and the guests ate every last bite.  Will use this recipe again for chicken and steak. Wonderful!!!"
283773,171002,2/14/2008,5,"Great, people have asked me for these again after trying them the first time. I used the left over marinade as a gravy too which works really well"
528137,171002,2/23/2008,5,"Absolutely delicious. I marainated only 10 hours, 1 pork tenderloin. After dumping in all that pepper, I have to admit, I had second thoughts (and I love pepper), but it worked wonderfully. This truly has a great flavor and exterior texture."
430971,171002,2/28/2008,5,"i made this recipe in the crock pot.  just added some beef bouillion cubes & water.  next time i'll use low-sodium soy.  but it was a 10!!!  everyone loved it, both younger kids, 15 yr old, dh & employee!  great recipe!"
731905,171002,3/10/2008,5,"WOW!  I used the crockpot like the reviewer below and boy was I pleased with this recipe.  Because of the small size of the corckpot, I did not add the water, just the other ingredients.  Like below Id probably use less (or low sodium) soy and a bit more brown sugar.  Will make again!"
29450,171002,6/15/2008,5,"Well, Kitten, this was one of your recipes I had chosen to make for Father's Day this year!  Thanks for posting this on my thread! This was heavenly and so decadent!  You always have the best recipes!! We all just LOVED these chops!!  I did not change or substitue anything and they were just fantabulous!  These, along with a new grill for hubby, he said, made the best Father's Day, so thank you SO much from all of us over here in GA!!!"
243474,171002,10/14/2008,5,"Another Kittencal winner.  Changed servings to 4 chops and used one tenderloin.  Marinated 22 hours, turning throughout the day.  Didn't add the extra salt. Used ginger powder.  Grilled 15 minures per side on a 400 degree gas grill.  Served with Recipe #189438, grilled corn and asparagus.  Excellent!"
386380,171002,11/12/2008,5,"OMG we loved these. Granted, we marinated them for 2 days! LOL honestly, any more than 2 days and it probably would have been too potent. We even made chicken with the marinade the next night! Very very good. Kudos Kittencal!"
681864,171002,1/17/2009,4,"We made this and thought the fresh ginger was that extra special something that made these great.  Thanks, for posting."
180406,171002,2/17/2009,4,"This was extremely good. I would say excellent but it was very salty. Reminds me of burbon chicken. The smell of the marinade, alone, drove us crazy. The only changes I made were: I used boneless pork tenderloin instead of chops, I didn't salt it, I used 1/2 tsp. of black pepper instead of 2 tbsp. (sounded like too much) and I roasted it in the oven in the marinade (because I was afraid it would dry out otherwise). I turned it over about every 30 minutes because it was, indeed, drying out. I will definitly be making this again but I plan to cut the soy to 1/2 c. Thanks for sharing!!"
496803,171002,3/17/2009,4,"This was a very moist pork chop!  I made two changes to the recipe- first, I cut the marinade in half and used for 4 chops that were just under 3/4 inch thick.  Second, I used regular soy sauce instead of low sodium.  DO NOT make the mistake of using regular soy sauce.  It will be too salty.  I'll be enjoying this again, thanks so much for posting."
306797,171002,5/19/2009,5,"Oh, what a meal!  I made these for dinner tonight & they were fabulous.  Only got to marinate for a half hour, so can imagine how spectacular they would have been after 12 hours.  The only change I made was to use a little less garlic.  Will certainly be making these again soon.  Made for ZWT5 by a Hell's Kitchen Angel."
201604,200723,11/2/2007,5,awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
904483,171002,5/31/2009,5,"If I could have given this 10 stars I would have!!!
I left the pork chops in the marinade overnight  and all the next day...because we are working in the fields and grilling is the easiest at 10 pm when you are very tired! 
I followed the recipe to the ""T"" and they were incredibly good! I chose this recipe because I have faith in all your recipes and I knew it would be really good!!!
Thanks Kittencal! It really made our work day end pleasantly! 
Jelly :)"
274139,171002,6/14/2009,5,"This was so good, at 9:00 at night I had to yell at the boys to not eat anymore (they each had 4 chops for dinner) so Dad could have for lunch.  Went out and bought more pork chops, marinated them then froze so we can have anytime without waiting a day!"
657191,171002,6/20/2009,5,"I tried this recipe this week-end with pork tenderloins. I didn't change anything except to add more brown sugar & garlic. What can I say, the meat was incredibly tender and flavorful. We like it so much we heated up the marinade to make sure it was safe and to use with the meat. This deserves more than 5 stars for sure. Thank you, thank you! UPDATE - Made this again (still love it). I use the low sodium soy sauce and don't add any other salt. That way people can add salt to their dish as they like. I have to keep on the low sodium side of recipes. Thanks! 
UPDATE: Made this for my sister & her husband. He has health issues and any meat he eats has to be really tender. Cooked it in the crockpot this time is absolutely melted in our mouths. Another convert!! Thank you again and again!!!!"
1332481,171002,7/22/2009,5,Best recipe for marinated pork chops I've tried.  Use it weekly.  FANTASTIC.
1168148,171002,8/1/2009,5,Good marinade for pork chops.I did not have bourbon and made the substitution suggested and marinated them overnight.Thanks Kittencal for the recipe
870390,171002,11/17/2009,5,"Delicious!! Marinated over night and made in broiler, about 12 minutes. Perfect combination of flavors."
107583,171002,8/15/2010,5,"Excellent marinade!  I did the tenderloin option, and placed them in a grill basket attachment on my rotisserie.  They cooked in about 20 minutes.  Used Jack Daniel's for the bourbon.  Nice combination of flavors.  I think this would be good on chicken thighs also, or boneless country spareribs.  Made for Grilling tag game at Kittencalskitchen.com."
576273,171002,4/5/2013,5,everyone loved! Even the boy whol just told me that he hated pork chops! thanks for a wonderful family supper Kittencal! Really yummy! Marinaded for a little more than 12 hours. May half pepper next time. Used heaping tablespoons of garlic and brown sugar. Used low sodium soy sauce and may slightly reduce worcestershire next time as well. Next time I plan on making a reduction sauce with the marinade. Will be using for a go to pork chop recipe.
567380,171002,6/26/2013,5,"What a wonderful marinade!  I marinated for a day and then froze for later use.  I used bone-in 1&quot; pork chops.  These tasted like a steak house chop, so good.  Thank you for an easy marinade and how wonderful to have on hand after a busy day."
2000251469,171002,6/6/2015,0,"Jack Daniels is not a bourbon. It is a whiskey. Buffalo Trace, Wild Turkey, Four Roses etc are Bourbons"
57256,171002,10/10/2015,5,Great flavor and very easy !!!
202026,171002,10/16/2016,0,"So delicious for fall! Had to cut the recipe in half since there were only three of us. I marinated for only 8 hours, and it was still so delicious."
734891,171002,5/29/2017,5,I substituted Coconut Aminos for the soy sauce. This turned out absolutely wonderful when used on 2 pork loins marinated for 16hrs and then grilled! Juicy and flavorful! Thanks KittenCal for another great recipe!
2001667210,171002,8/17/2017,0,OMG!!! Had this tonight after marinating it for 24hrs. AND this was beyond Delish!!! By far this is now our fam fav. I paired it with garlic/parm asparagus &amp; loaded mashed. Fabulous meal.
226863,171002,3/25/2018,5,I ended up marinating for about 36 hours. Great flavor! The meat was done on the grill in no time at all! I used pork tenderloins and they were full of lavor and moist.
175492,171213,6/4/2006,5,"I made these exactly per your recipe, putting the spread into a pastry bag and refrigerating for 15 minutes, then piped into mini tart shells I had made with my recipe for Pecan Crust recipe#170252.  This was a perfect combination of sweet and salty, and makes a great appetizer.
I will certainly be using this recipe again, thank you for sharing it with us."
269521,171213,6/10/2006,4,"I was a little  disappointed in these.   We love blue cheese and port together, but felt it lost some of it's zing mixed together.  Maybe the butter diluted the cheese too much.  "
486725,171213,2/12/2018,5,"This was so good. I used about 1/3 the butter, to let the blue cheese flavor really shine. I broiled it on English muffins, but I think this would be great over anything."
685988,265683,1/10/2008,4,LOVED it - Made this for dinner tonight - but with shrimp for me and chicken for husband (since he does not like shrimp).  I doubled the sauce since I was making it in 2 separate pans.  I substituted the fresh OJ with Tropicana Organic OJ since that was all I had on hand and added a pinch of sugar.  Didn't have the chili paste either so used chili sauce which was really spicy but we like it that way.  Served over a bed of steamed rice.  Also lightly steamed some broccoli and added that also at step 6.  Husband loves Chinese and said it was one of the best dished I made.  Highly recommended.
732171,265683,1/18/2008,5,"I kind of surprised myself with this one, I had to pick up a few of the items at the store, but so what! It was worth it! This is my second time back to get the recipe, which is why Im rating it a 5. Little experience needed - Overall fairly simple! Love It! Love It!"
376098,265683,2/29/2008,5,"Delicious!  Great blend of tangy, sweet, and spicy.  Easy and fast, too.  Thanks for this!"
158446,265683,3/23/2008,5,This is a fabulous shrimp recipe.  It was sweet & spicy at the same time & easy to make.  I cut down on the chili paste by about 1/2 and that was just right for us.  I used about a pound of shrimp and also threw in some leftover firm tofu & it tasted great.  We'll definitely make again.
420177,265683,12/21/2008,5,awesome and so easy!  Tossed in a red pepper and broccoli lightly steamed at step 6 (thx Pinot Grigio) served over brown rice.  Nice amount of heat and very tasty.  For sure I'll make it again.  Would be nice with chicken too.  Thanks a lot!
831878,265683,1/30/2009,5,YUM!  This was fantastic.  I too used less of the chili paste with garlic and it was plenty spicy.  We used peapods and red peppers as our vegetables. I plan to try it with chicken as well and with the addition of pineapples since it resembles a sweet & sour.  I added some toasted and crushed sesame seeds at the end and I think that was the perfect finish!
1085861,265683,2/11/2009,5,"Fantastic recipe!  I added sliced mushrooms, red bell pepper, snow peas and canned mini corn.  Definitely a keeper!!"
113509,265683,5/14/2009,4,"I used precooked shrimp and cut back on the honey a bit, as hubby is not crazy about sweet mixed with savory. I also did not use fresh orange juice, but it still came out very well. I added some red pepper flakes & cayenne pepper for heat, and it made a very good dinner."
470351,265683,10/26/2009,5,Most excellent!  I added steamed broccoli and 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms.  I doubled all the sauce ingredients and served over white rice.  FABULOUS!  Added the 2 full tablespoons of Sambal Olek and added more to my individual bowl as well.  SPICY!!  YuMMY!
1847050,265683,3/9/2011,5,"What a versitile recipe! I put a spin on it because I had a bunch of veggies I needed to use. I added red bell pepper, bok choy, broccoli, and snow peas. I doubled the sauce due to the added veggies and substituted sweet chili sauce because our daughter doesn't like spicy! All of that on top of thai rice noodles and we all had a great meal!"
749060,265683,11/21/2011,5,"It really is as good as a restaurant, and it's probably got 1/4th the calories!  I've used the recipe with chicken also."
245429,265683,3/21/2013,5,Made this sauce to use with a vegetable stir fry.  Really good flavors and easy to make.
739960,265683,5/14/2013,5,This recipe is simply delicious. Spicy and sweet. I added stir fried sliced mushroom and zucchinis. I served it with angel hair pasta. It&#039;s a keeper. I will be cooking it up again. Simple to make. Everybody loved it.
1659953,265683,12/16/2013,5,Easy &amp; Delicious. I added broccoli and cut down on the honey. Next time will add the full amount.
522099,297846,6/2/2008,0,"I dont' want to rate this one because I think the ground turkey I used may have contibuted to us not caring for it.  The taste was pretty good, but the texture wasn't good at all.  I think my ground turley was *too* ground.  The patties fell apart on the grill even tho I froze them first to help them stay together.  Just not our cup of tea I'm sorry to say.  Made for ZWT 4"
644902,297846,7/12/2008,4,"Tastey burgers, I think the next time I would omit the waterchestnuts as all they really ad is a little crunch - I think I would choose to use red bell pepper diced to accomplish the same crunch - I used homemade bread crumbs and found the texture to be great - thanks for the post!!! will be made again"
164610,297846,7/23/2008,3,"These were interesting, but not ouststanding imho.  My package of ground turkey was 1.25lbs, so I got 5 burgers.  I used the exact ingred amts listed for 1lb though.  I used 1/4 cup Eggbeaters for the egg.  I misread the recipe and didn't even notice the Frank's Red Hot sauce until I was about to prepare the burgers.  So I subbed Tabasco sauce (not sure how closely Tabasco resembles Frank's).  I used a homemade teriyaki sauce (Recipe #139274), which seemed to work well.  These were sooo moist that they fell apart.  I liked the crunchiness and texture of the French-Fried Onions and water chestnuts and the lettuce was a nice complement to the flavors.  All the flavors were definitely there, although the Tabasco was in the background.  I used ground ginger, instead of fresh.  I cooked these on a griddle at 350 degrees F 5 mins on one side, 7 mins or so on the other.  Bf thought these were okay, but he also had 2 burgers, hehe.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game.  Thanks for sharing!"
427184,92932,3/25/2009,5,Great salad - simple and easy.
498271,297846,9/27/2012,5,"We thought these burgers were just terrific!  Always looking for a way to pump up the healther-but-often-bland turkey burger and this recipe definitely fit the bill  Left out the water chestnuts, otherwise made as directed.  Couldn't quite bring myself to serve them with just lettuce so spread the bun with some spicy mustard and we really enjoyed these - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
182010,324786,1/13/2009,5,"This really is a creamy and elegant dessert, not overly sweet (despite the caramel).  The butternut squash is perfect in this, tho I suspct the recipe would work as well with pumpkin or perhaps other winter squash.  I roasted my squash and I think brings out more of the squash's flavor.  Only one caveat:  if you are making this as one large flan, a larger dish may be in order--I found the one quart size to be a bit small."
318262,324786,6/1/2011,5,"This was fantastic! Admittedly, I changed the recipe a bit (or used the alternatives suggested in the intro) but still, super super delish! I baked it as a pie and served it with whipped cream and carmel sauce on top. Instead of cooking a whole squash, I wanted to take a short cut and use canned pumpkin but unfortuately the store only had canned pumpkin pie. I ended up using that and not adding the extra spices or sugar which was PERFECT. Thanks for a great recipe. Made for ZWT7."
186855,436329,5/10/2012,5,"These are incredibly delicious, and so very easy to make.  I used 1 tbsp of dough for each cookie, but because of how they spread, you should only do 6 on the cookie sheet.  Next time I'm going to try 1 tsp size and see how that goes.  These are beautiful cooled around a rolling pin.  I'm thinking drizzling with a bit of melted chocolate would make these gems very fancy.  Thanks Iceland.  I'll definitely be making these again and again."
461834,481337,7/23/2012,5,"Yeah for white wine sangria!!!!  I get a headache if I drink a glass of red wine, so very happy to be able to enjoy this white wine sangria.  Loved the fruits in this sangria, looked beautiful also!  I didn't bother with the grape garnish as I added a slice of the apple, lemon and orange to the glasses.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  Made for ZWT 8."
204024,481337,7/28/2012,5,This was a hit at our house.  We were having company for dinner and this was totally gone before we could grab a picture.  Made for ZWT8.
522496,1207,9/1/2007,5,Works well with 2% milk.
745182,1207,2/1/2008,5,super comfort food.  so easy!
64539,1207,7/1/2008,5,"Actually, it works really well with almond milk, too. Nice recipe."
866331,1207,9/14/2008,5,great recipe!!  very creamy and smooth.  i usually make it in the oven which takes about 3 hours.  this was so much easier and very tasty.  my only alterations were that i left out the bourbon and i will be adding raisins next time.  thank you for posting this recipe.
23466,1207,10/5/2008,4,"The first time I made this recipe, I cooked the mixture for the time specified in the recipe. The rice was undercooked.  Next time, I cooked it longer (40 minutes) and added slivered almonds and golden raisins when I added the sugar - about 20 minutes into the cooking.  I omitted the egg.  The second time I made this, it was wonderful"
907169,1207,1/19/2009,5,"Very yummy. I too cooked mine for probably closer to 40 minutes, I wasn't keeping track though.  I also used mostly skim milk, and one cup of 2%.  I thought it might not be to creamy, but I really can't tell at all that I used mostly skim, I think it's creamy!  I also didn't use bourbon because I didn't have any."
55910,1207,2/15/2009,5,"I was looking for a recipe that looked like the one my mom used to make. Unfortunately she passed away not long ago and I never wrote the recipe down I would just call her for it and she would give it to me over the phone. I didn't add the bourbon or vanilla, I also added a cinnamon stick to the rice while it was cooking just cuz that is what mom used to do. Thanks for posting, now I can make rice pudding like mom use to make."
1176380,1207,2/19/2009,0,its great receipe just one note..is better to cook rice separate and then add to the mixture it takes least time.
108814,34233,8/20/2005,3,"2 onions is too much.  I used half an onion and that was even too much.  Other than that, it was good."
486888,1207,3/1/2009,3,"Welp, used the cooked rice someone suggested would cut the time but then there was excess milk so not the best idea.  Had to simmer it longer to get it to thicken--closer to 30-40 minutes.  I'm not a fan of the consistency you get when you add the beaten egg. I could see cooked whites and yolks in the pudding.  With all that said the taste was on target.  Thanks for sharing, it was fun trying something different."
174722,1207,8/3/2009,5,"Delish!! Made it twice. The first time, I did use the egg but tempered it first. The second time, I was out of eggs and it turned out just fine. Took closer to 40 minutes, but well worth it! Fabulous!! Also, did not use bourbon - we don't drink!"
1189278,1207,10/9/2009,5,"I used orange zest, replaced nutmeg with five spice powder, and dark rum.  Amazing flavor--will make it again."
408318,1207,10/26/2009,5,I also added a little Amaretto...WOW it was great!
768828,1207,7/3/2012,5,"YUM - I tempered the egg before I added to the rice pudding, but not sure it actually needed the egg.  I think it would still have been good without it.  I did cook this in a double boiler, so took quite a bit longer, but eliminates the need to stir all the time. I also didn't add the bourban, but next time I have some Southern Comfort,  I'm going to add that."
356127,28225,10/13/2006,5,"Im so glad you posted this,they did it on a local news segment here and I didnt write it down and couldnt find it,have been searching for it.Thanks so much for posting,i have made it once before,now I want to try it in the microwave.A great cake.Thanks."
1042494,28225,2/4/2015,5,"I used a package of devil&#039;s food cake mix.  It was quick, easy and very moist. I will definitely make again."
26512,34233,9/20/2002,5,"We made this guacamole to serve with our fajita dinner on Sunday. Excellent! Love the tang the lime juice adds. I didn't change a thing...and won't! We'll be serving this often, thanks for the recipe!"
37868,34233,10/13/2002,5,"The Race is on(Winston Cup) Hubby wanted a snack.I have a Avocado. Went to Zaar (Home). What did I find? Guacamole Recipe. This is great. Hubby loved it. I do not know of one thing I would change about this recipe. It is a keeper.
Thank You."
66246,34233,1/12/2003,5,This is an excellent guacamole recipe.  I made it and also served it with Beef Fajitas (#16871).  This was better than the guacamole they taught us to make while vacationing in Mexico.  The fresh lime juice really adds a nice flavor.
56339,34233,1/22/2003,3,I think the amount of lime juice took away some of the avacado flavor you expect in a traditional guacamole.  It left my mouth a little dry and tart more than the usual onion and garlic flavors I'd expect.  I'd definitely add less lime next time I make it.
37779,34233,4/6/2003,5,This is just the best. I mashed the avocado but not too much so it would be a little chunky. The seasonings were perfect. I could just taste the cumin which I think makes everything better. Will use this one again as we eat Mexican food a lot. Thanks Sue ;-)
1676,34233,3/19/2004,5,Used 10 drops Tobasco instead of cayenne pepper.  Excellent recipe and very easy to make in minutes!
100677,34233,5/5/2004,5,"I just loved this recipe. The guacamole tasted great. I had a BBQ with my family and I made this for everyone, and all I heard the whole night was Mmmmm this guacamole is delicious !!!!"
104600,34233,7/23/2004,5,Wow was this good...  Everyone wanted the recipe including my sister who is the one that always makes the guacamole.  Thanks for a yummy.  Great recipe Sue.
9869,34233,9/2/2004,5,"I made this guacamole to put in a seven layer dip I was making for a party...lots of comments on the flavour, and so very moreish, thanks Sue."
55380,34233,10/9/2004,4,This was a good basic guacamole recipe. The lime flavor was a bit overpowering (and I *like* lime juice and use it often) so I made another batch and tried with slightly less lime and stirred in a tablespoon of sour cream; will make it that way from now on. Thanks! 
172635,34233,5/6/2005,5,I used 10 drops of tabasco sauce instead of cayenne pepper.  Also used 1 TBLS of sour cream.  The taste was great
64682,34233,5/7/2005,5,"Mase this for our cinco de mayo dinner as a side for enchiladas.  I used two Haas avocados.  Delicious side, easy to make, and enjoyed by all.  Followed recipe exactly."
168581,34233,5/27/2005,5,"Excellent taste, I used less lime juice as it was a bit overpowering.

So easy to make and what a hit!"
106867,34233,6/21/2005,5,Yum!  Very authentic.  I made half the recipe becuase it was only for my DH and myself - good thing too!  We ate it ALL in one sitting.
88099,34233,7/8/2005,5,Wonderful guacamole Sue.  My avocados were small so I used 6 and kept the rest of the ingredents the same except added a little extra cayenne pepper and a little extra lime juice.  Thanks for posting.
184763,34233,12/12/2005,5,"Delicious! Growing up in Texas, I have had lots of guacamole and this version is top notch. The lime juice and cumin really give it a great flavor. I added 10 drops or so of Tabasco because I like it. I also used a pastry blender to mash the avocado in the interest of keeping it chunky. Great recipe!"
226892,34233,2/5/2006,5,"Fabulous Guacamole this was loved by all, just the right flavours together, would not change anything in this recipe at all, had tacos and served this guacamole and wonderful salsa # 9272, went down a treat.  Thanks so much, will try freezing so I have it for the winter months."
147109,34233,4/7/2006,5,"I don't know why I have never bothered to make my own guacamole before, but I really don't like store bought all that much either!  This was very simple and VERY good!  Thanks"
124249,34233,5/14/2006,5,"This was a very flavorful guacamole. Used it on burritos and a dip for chips. 

Thanks  Sue L.

Bullwinknle."
186071,34233,6/9/2006,5,"This was easy to trow together and tasty at the same time. I served it with fajitas, salsa, and shreded cheeese and we had a gr8 MEXICAN MEAL.Thank you for sharring."
225903,34233,10/12/2006,5,"Mmmm! Thanks for sharing this recipe. I made it as written except I added some chopped cilantro. I love the lime flavor and it's very easy to adjust the seasonings to make it spicy or mild, as needed."
361170,34233,10/13/2006,5,"My husband can't have tomatoes or cayenne pepper, so I left those out. Even without them it was delicious & so simple. "
226989,34233,10/14/2006,5,"This was a tasty guac. I mixed it until very free of lumps in my mixer, I like both chunky and smooth, but I knew my friends would like smooth. We gobbled it all up, and wow, the garlic!! I would use just one cloved if they're large or else those who don't love garlic as much might be a bit off it. Very good."
302094,34233,12/3/2006,5,"I made this last night to go with fajita's. I just ate some more with chips, I can't get enough of this stuff. I love guacamole. This is my new recipe thanks so much!"
353412,34233,1/2/2007,5,I just made this recipe.  It was awesome.  I served it with some fish tacos.  Thanks!
52037,34233,4/19/2007,5,"Not only was this a very quick and easy recipe, it was absolutely delicious.  It had just enough kick to it so that it wasn't boring, yet not overpowering. I even put it on a sandwich instead of mayo. Boy was that good.  Thanks Sue L, this is my guacamole recipe from now on."
374520,34233,5/2/2007,5,this was so easy and so yummy!  It was a big hit at our dinner party and even my toddler loved it.  Thanks for sharing it.
412847,34233,5/21/2007,5,"This was really good.  I'm not usually a fan of guacamole, but this had just the right blend of flavors to make it tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!"
289319,34233,9/1/2007,4,This was really good but lacked a tiny bit of something for me.  Never could place my finger on what it was though.  I will make it again and play around with the ingredients.  Thanks for a great base recipe!
363149,34233,9/18/2007,4,"Great guacamole.  In response to the last review, I think the recipe is missing the cilantro.  I added a 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro.  I think guacamole definitely needs it!"
475706,34233,9/22/2007,5,"Oh so good! I used about a 1/4th the amount of tomatoes and onion, out of personal preference. I also added freshly chopped cilantro and 1/2 tsp of lf sour cream. Perfect."
478451,34233,10/20/2007,5,Excellent recipe.  The only change I made was Durkee's sauce instead of the cayenne powder and I omitted the cumin.
56003,34233,11/10/2007,4,"Very, very good, Sue.  Will make this again.  Think next time, though, I will add some pickled jalapenos.  We like it just a little bumped up."
141885,34233,12/3/2007,5,I served this at a baby shower and it was immediately consumed with much praise.  Thanks for a tasty and easy recipe!
704950,34233,2/7/2008,5,"This guac is really good!  I like that it only has a little bit of cumin.  I think that cumin is overpowering if too much is used so this is just perfect!!  I love how chunky it is.  I used 2 roma tomatoes as those seem to be the only ones that are ever ripe these days in the stores, plus they don't have a ton of juice like other tomatoes.  This recipe helps limes get ahead in the fight against lemons for which makes the best quac."
153188,34233,2/13/2008,5,This was fantastic!!!!  I coarsely chopped everything so it was more like a quacamole salsa.  And used it as a topper on a Festive Sausage Casserole (Which I will post later tonight).  Thanks for a great and easy quac recipe.
174096,34233,2/13/2008,5,"Great!  And so easy to make.  I served some by itself, and then used some in Recipe #257182.  Delicious both ways!  Thanks for a keeper."
133174,34233,11/11/2008,4,This is a really nice combination of ingredients. It was a little milder than my normal recipe and I did add a diced jalapeno along with some cilantro.  Served this with Recipe #256697.
477439,34233,11/12/2008,5,"Easy, quick and so good!"
844554,34233,11/17/2008,5,"Yummy, yummy, yum! Plus this was very quick and easy. I added jalapeno to it also. Going in the keeper file!"
650373,34233,12/14/2008,4,"I like the combination of ingredients, but I think the whole medium onion was too much. I only added about 3/4 of an onion and the taste was overwhelming, even with an added avocado to try to tame it a bit. I made mine with no tomatoes, as I had none. I also added a couple Tbsp. or sour cream."
50141,69243,4/5/2005,4,"Very easy and a nice flavor, I used regular sweet paprika, will try it with the smoky once I find some.  Took leftovers and chopped up and put into a salad!!!"
1088637,34233,12/21/2008,5,"hello!  i only just registered with RecipeZaar, so this is only my second review, but this is my oh-so-reliable guacamole recipe (and i have tried many of them!)  This is by far the best, and everyone always loves it.  The only change I make is to use scallions in place of the onions, because they give a slightly less oniony flavor, but otherwise i follow it exactly  every time I make it (and i have made it many, many times) - always delicious and always a winner!   Thanks Sue!"
382123,34233,3/31/2009,5,"This is one terrific recipe! I love that it uses cumin because most recipes call for cilantro and it's not always on hand. I placed all the ingredients in a large zip lock bag and squished it.  The texture was great, part creamy and some lumps.  Snip the corner and pipe into a serving bowl. No dirty dishes to clean up!"
909680,34233,4/24/2009,5,"We all loved it at my recipe club. I added a little extra of half a lemon I had and extra garlic and I didn't add the pepper (just the cayenne) or the onion, since we were feeding kids too."
719083,34233,5/17/2009,5,"This was an easy recipe and turned out great. The one ""oops"" I had was that I forgot to add in the lime juice before the other ingredients so it wasn't evenly spread throughout the guacamole. I mashed my avocado a little bit chunkier and I thought it tasted even better than regular guacamole. I threw in some red pepper as well to give it some more kick. 
Made for the Dining Daredevils ZWT5"
526666,34233,6/9/2009,5,"This was SOOOO good! I really enjoyed the flavor of it...I only used 1 medium/large tomato and also added 1 jalapeno, chopped(seeds and all!) and a bit more cayenne than directed! I did put the avocado pit back in the guac, and that really seems to help with discoloration! I enjoyed this on top of nachos and with tortilla chips alone. Outstanding :-D Thanks for a go-to guac, Sue L! Made for ZWT 5."
720929,34233,7/22/2009,5,"Really fabulous and easy to make. Not to mention quick! I only used one tomato because no one in may family is a fan of them, and I didn't have a lime so I used half a lemon and it tasted fine to me. It was gone in minutes, and I think I'll be making this again. Thanks, Sue L."
315055,34233,7/29/2009,3,"The tomato and onion flavor were too strong.  I think one tomato and half of the onion would have made this a lot better.  The final product didn't have the ""green guacamole"" look, but more of a red, since there were so many tomatoes in it."
534554,34233,1/29/2010,5,"Love, love, loved this!  I also only used one small chopped tomato.  That was plenty in my opinion.  I also used only half a small onion.  I usually use three tablespoons of red onion in my guacamole, and I think I will use that next time as well.  One medium onion would have been too much for my taste! I also put in the juice of two limes since my limes were pretty small.  I loved the fresh garlic taste too!  Thanks for posting Sue!  This will be my go-to guac recipe from now on!"
1453057,34233,2/22/2010,5,"Just what I was looking for!  At a barbeque (in February), I received tons of compliments on this recipe--even from non-guac lovers.  Thanks!"
609933,34233,3/4/2010,5,"I love this recipe.  My boyfriend even says it's even better than his (which is hard to do!)  I usually double the amount of cayenne pepper and half the lime.  So good, you won't be disappointed!"
333017,34233,4/4/2010,4,"You can't go too wrong with this traditional quacamole dip.  I used 3 avocados, as some of my avocado was bruised in some areas.  I seeded the tomatos... added about 1/2 tsp more of cumin and left out the cayenne pepper.  I used a pastry cutter to cut up the avocado as we like ours on the chunky side.  Yum!!  Thanks for the posting"
140132,34233,5/6/2010,5,We made this for our Cinco de Mayo dinner and we loved it.  I served this with our Chimis and spanish rice.  Thank you so much for this great guac recipe.  We loved it.
34025,34233,5/11/2010,5,This was my first attempt at making guacamole...it was just wonderful...will definitely make it again...Thanks for sharing.
17646,34233,10/24/2010,4,"This was my first time making guacamole, but it turned out pretty well with this recipe.  It seemed like something was missing though, but I can't exactly pin down what it was."
452940,34233,10/25/2010,0,"I made this up for Rick (as I do not like avocados). He scooped some up with a tortilla chip, put it in his mouth, smiled and gave me a thumbs up. Made as directed, adding a bit of cilantro. :)"
572426,34233,12/12/2010,0,"Now that was really good! I used the little grape tomatoes, one white onion, couple of garlic cloves and a small handful of cilantro, mixed  and chopped all the veggies together in the mini- food processor and then added them to the avocado and lemon juice (didn't have any limes on hand) I did punch it up a bit with more salt and more cayenne pepper and it was really tasty. Its going to a party today for someone who is going to be living in Mexico. Ole"
1749803,34233,1/10/2011,5,I've made this several times- absolutely perfect- one of the few recipes I never need to adjust. Thank you!
1573569,34233,1/14/2011,5,Excellent.  Made exactly as listed except I added chopped cilantro.  Was not sure about cumin as I find it overpowers some dishes.  But it was very good in the small amount called for.  All guests at New Years Eve gathering loved this recipe.
471300,34233,1/17/2011,5,So easy and so delicious.  I didn't chop things up finely but quickly chopped it with a hand blender.  I used it on tostadas.
1029096,34233,1/18/2011,4,"Tasted great!  Made as directed, minus the lime juice cuz I didn't have one and used lemon juice.  thanks!  :)"
57222,34233,5/29/2011,4,"Served with ground beef tortillas, salsa and the works - very good! Seasonings were spot on, but I would use half the onion and tomato the next time; just a personal preference, we like our guacamole more avocado-y! Thanks for the recipe!"
481060,34233,11/5/2011,5,Simple and delicious!  Thanks for posting!
1415433,34233,11/25/2011,5,"used 3 large avacados, added lots of cilantro and some spicy seasoning i have."
1042494,34233,7/6/2012,5,"This was a basic, yet excellent recipe that tasted great as a tortilla dip. Prepare immediately before serving. Even though I did add the lime juice as instructed, it still turned dark green to brownish within an hour or two. It still tastes great but looks a little less appetizing. I will definitely make again."
906665,34233,9/16/2012,5,"Scrumptious! I only wish I had more! I made a half batch, used 1 tbsp lime juice and used red onion instead of white. Sooo good!"
502095,34233,1/29/2013,5,"I loved it! My family doesn't like onions so I didnt add the onion, and I totally forgot about the tomato until later, but it was still excellent. And easy too! I just put everything in the little chopper and it whipped everything up really fast. I will be making it again!"
1060667,34233,2/29/2016,4,"Good guacamole, but where&#039;s the cilantro?  I really can&#039;t imagine a good guac. without it so I had to add it in.  Then it was perfect, so four stars from me :)"
376986,34233,7/3/2016,3,Needs one or two more avocados.
26451,75735,12/23/2003,5,"This is incredibly easy and very good!  I didn't have mushrooms, so I just omitted them, but I can't wait to try it again with them.  The recipe reminded me of cordon bleu, but its much easier to make and tastes just as great!"
211398,75735,5/14/2005,5,This was a yummy dish that holds 5 stars for presentation with company. Next time I might even add some herbs to the crumb mixture to give the dish even more kick.
53959,75735,9/27/2006,5,This chicken was to die for. It will be on a regular rotation at our house. My family just LOVED it. 
140107,144567,11/12/2005,5,Finely a good boston bean recipe using dry beans. this is great.
263166,144567,11/16/2005,5,I've been looking for a recipe like this for the last ten years.My Mom used to make baked  beans and I never got her recipe. These taste just like hers! Thanks 
209441,144567,11/27/2005,5,"Just fantasic! this is a great recipe for baked beans, we loved the flavor, I used canned beans, big mistake,  they were a little soft, next time dryed beans for this recipe, it was still so good! thanks."
189643,144567,1/17/2006,5,"Love the flavor! I made a half batch, and found I had to keep adding water to keep it from drying out and making the beans crispy. This is definitely worth the time, just watch the beans in the oven so they don't dry out. Tastes like my dh's grandma's beans (only better) so I'll be making this often!Thanks!"
240123,144567,5/14/2006,1,"I'm real curious how anyone trying this recipe as stated made it successfully. In my early sunday morning work to get this recipe started for a Mother's Day Family cook-out...the adding salt thing at the beginning of the cooking process didn't get my attention...as such I followed the recipe to the letter...and my beans never softened up...the whole recipe ended up in the trash, along with a stop along the way to the grocery store for 3 cans of ""baked beans""....I've done dried beans numerous times, and never added salt till near the end....and in the morning fog...this didn't flag my attention...and it wasn't  unti they weren't getting soft that I remembered the issue...in that you do not add salt to dried beans until they have essentially cooked...

Recipe posters do need to exercise great caution...as it's easy for even seasoned cooks to miss important details.

This recipe as stated will not turn out properly...if the salt is added at the beginning.

The sauce would be fantastic...and I do plan on trying them again...using the proper preparation procedures...in the mean time...I have 12 servings sitting in the trash this evening."
542159,199329,9/13/2009,4,"So easy! Could not find Comstock sliced apples, so used Comstock apple pie filling, other then that made as written. Was not sure what to expect from this as it turns out it makes a very sweet, very light, and very tender baked apple pudding. Thanks for the post."
125356,202722,4/9/2007,4,Very good! We had about 2 loafs of bread soaking the juice. Thanks mikekey.
374416,202722,6/15/2007,5,"mikekey, this was wonderful!  The salmon came out perfectly done, and the sauce complemented it so well.  I didn't have any saffron, so I used a bit more of the other spices.  There was certainly more than enough sauce which I soaked up with some French bread.  Thanks!"
1048179,202722,7/31/2012,4,The flavors on this were wonderful and the fish turned out very moist. I was a little unsure what to do with all the leftover sauce though. Perhaps I should have let it cook down longer? Maybe serve it with rice or pasta to soak it up.<br/>Made for ZWT8
36128,288023,3/2/2008,5,"MMMM THESE ARE GOOD!  THANKS MOM!  These are the comments I got from my crew tonight.  These are so good, and the kiddos felt spoiled since I made them all their very own little meatloaf!  LOL  I loved this, and will be making these again!"
593159,288023,3/6/2008,2,We didn't like these very well.  They needed something else to make them more moist.  I'm not sure what it needed though.
133174,304974,6/9/2008,5,"A fantastic meal that goes together very quick.  I did make a few adjustments based on personal preference and what I had in the fridge.  The pork tenderloin was precooked pork loin which was cut into strips and stir-fried in a small amount of the dressing along with the grated ginger.  There was some extra grated ginger thrown in and the peppers, onions and snow peas were stir-fried just until crisp tender.  Dressing was served on the side as suggested.  Made for *Help a Camera-less Chef Game #5*"
835875,304974,7/4/2008,3,This recipe is a great summer recipe. I used rice noodles instead of soba. I did find the dressing a little bit too 'vinegar-y' so I would probably recommend more oil and less vinegar? I will definately make this one again though! Thank-you!
572571,333243,8/25/2010,4,EASY and a favorite of my family. I double this recipe and it still fits into the bundt pan perfectly!
47892,335005,2/7/2010,5,The rice turned out perfectly cooked. This was the first time I prepared red rice alone and not in combination with other grains. It gave me the opportunity to appreciate its flavor and color. PS I used grapeseed oil and let the rice rest a full fifteen minutes. Thank you for posting the recipe. cg
383346,335005,2/26/2012,5,It was my first time cooking red rice and it was great.  The texture was perfect.  Thanks Alex :)  Made for All you can cook buffet
1801201524,335005,2/12/2014,4,Well I tried it in my clay pot for the first time after seeing this recipe and did not add any oil. The red rice was fluffy and separated in other words was cooked perfectly. I got mine from miriamsearthencookware.com and the pots got a great job cooking. I also tried cooking brown rice in my clay pot and results were the same. Most importantly it holds all the nutrients in the food and I don&#039;t have to worry about metals or chemicals getting into my food.
2000626598,335005,10/31/2015,5,"Just made this red rice today.  Perfect, even with my partner lifting the lid by accident, I just let it sit and complete cooking and let it rest 10 min.  FLUFFY AND DELICIOUS RICE!"
2001435049,335005,3/14/2017,5,"I used Sesame Oil instead, and my rice turns out to be fragrant and delicious!!!"
28087,376236,4/14/2010,4,"This is a good quick breakfast sandwich. I made as written but reduced the milk to 1/4 cup and next time will cut that back to 1 tablespoon, as I feel that the egg mixture was thinned out to much. Thanks *Made for Spring 2010 PAC*"
145352,458202,6/15/2011,5,Delicious!!!! I added some dried cranberries too!!! Was a wonderful lunch. Made for ZWT and the Saucy Silverados.
463435,458202,8/4/2013,5,Made this as written but then added roughly 1-2 Tbs. of chopped pecans to the mix. Loved it! Did not serve it in the coconut halves though it sounded really good. Made sandwiches instead on a dense multigrain bread. Will be making lettuce wraps tomorrow for lunch with the leftovers. This will definitely be made again in the near future. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe morgainegeiser. Made and reviewed for the August 2013 AUS/NZ Recipe Swap.
2625,7379,5/24/2001,0,"Weird. This reminds me of Buster Douglas.  

Why so complicated? Why bother having oysters at all?  This recipe would probably work with seitan. Or, possibly...yes."
22015,46906,11/25/2002,5,"I served this with noodles and it was really good.  I love the flavor of the wine, mushrooms & beef.  Thanks for posting such a great recipe!"
47907,46906,2/23/2005,5,I have a much more complicated recipe for beef burgundy that I was going to make but I wasn't in the mood to make it so I searched here and found this recipe and it was a hit!  My house smelled so good all day.  I made exactly as posted except I sliced my carrots instead of shredded and served over rice.  Thank you so much for posting this quick and delicious recipe!!!
85528,46906,2/26/2005,5,"We all loved this dish and there were no leftovers. Even my picky brother loved it.
I put in a whole bag of baby carrots.  I didn't use any flour in it either.
"
32772,46906,3/13/2006,5,Another great crock pot meal.  I served this over wide egg noodles and didn't thicken the broth with water and flour.  Nice Flavor. Similiar to Beef Burgundy. The only change I would make is to cook this dish for 8 hours on Low instead of 10 hours on Low. 
110135,46906,8/3/2006,5,Easy and excellent!  My kids loved this.  I served it over noodles.  I have some leftover which I'm going to put on a baked potato for my lunch.  Great recipe!
104022,46906,10/15/2006,5,"Excellent!  I used leftover Shiraz instead of burgundy wine, added some garlic powder, used fat free cream of mushroom soup, and used frozen sliced mushrooms instead of fresh.  Used 2 1/2 lbs organic beef chuck roast.  It got RAVE reviews from my guests who are major meat eaters.  I don't usu. eat beef, but I really liked this one, and the gravy was awesome!  It can feed 3-4 hungry adults easily, with seconds or thirds.  I put it in the crockpot at 7am and served it at 6pm, though it could have been eaten earlier just as well."
226372,46906,4/2/2007,5,This was really tasty and very easy to prepare.  I substituted more wine for the 1/2 cup of water.  I also used fresh thyme instead of dried.  I recommend garnishing the stew with Gremolata such as recipe # 136878 for a lovely bright flavour boost and showy presentation.  I will definitely make this again.
162826,46906,9/7/2007,5,"This is a delight to find! First, I love Beef Burundy; second I love my crock pot...put them together and whaddya got..the best of both! The ingredients are jusssst right in this terrific recipe! Will make again and again during the coming Fall and Winter. Smells like a French Bistro. Served over buttered and garlic sprinkled noodles. THX, Michelle. It's a winner!"
128945,46906,10/19/2007,5,"Excellent recipe!!!!!  Made this for 40 at the American Legion in Chapala, Mexico to rave reviews.  Thanks for making me look so good Michelle!!!!!"
128803,46906,1/15/2008,5,"Fabulous!  I used baby carrots instead of shredded, but otherwise kept everything the same.  Served it with wide egg noodles.  The whole family loved it!  This will be a family favorite in our household...definitely!"
35488,46906,1/21/2008,4,"Easy - good, but bland for me - will try more worcester sauce and add salt and pepper next time."
328909,46906,2/4/2008,5,This was made for chick flick night and was a big success.  I couldn't find golden cream of mushroom soup so I used vegetable broth and thickened it with flour.  It was so easy care in the crock pot.
58404,46906,9/25/2008,5,"I never follow a recipe exactly. I loved this recipe. I added celery salt, potatos and a little beef broth. I coated my meat in seasoned flour and browned it in the olive oil. I had to keep adding oil as my flour kept thickening it up as I browned my meat. When the meat was done, I added beef broth to the hot oil and flour and made a nice gravy which I added to my crock pot. I have never been good at making gravy, but now I know how! Thanks for posting this recipe."
440735,46906,2/4/2010,4,Really Good!  I used Cabernet as my wine and decreased the amount just a tad. I would keep the amount the next time unless I use a more expensive wine.  I cooked it 6 hours on high.  We had no leftovers.  Thx!
198154,46906,6/23/2010,4,DH gives this one 4 stars.  He said that the meat was nice and tender and it was simple enough for me to make.  I did slice up baby carrots instead of shredding carrots so they would be easier to pick out by our pickier eaters ;0)
1751843,46906,2/10/2012,5,Recipe sounds yummie.  gosh i forgot about using canned consume or as you suggested..  Did this when first got married some 40 years ago and always worked.  The burgendy wine sounds sooo good with the slow cooking.
363055,227257,4/12/2010,5,I love these muffins!!  I used frozen marion berries......yum!!
394592,99221,5/15/2007,5,I loved the combination of the zucchini and lemon flavors.  This makes a wonderfully light yummy muffin!!  I used a combo of 1/2 wheat and 1/2 all purpose flours and  eliminated the oil.  I added an extra lemony zing by soaking my shredded zucchini in lemon juice and adding that juice in with the wet ingredients.  I also upped the amount of lemon zest to a full tablespoon and added a teaspoon each of poppy seeds and nutmeg - I was just after a certain texture...  The result was a lovely batch of moist muffins that rose nicely and looked divinely sunny on our breakfast table.  A huge winner in my opinion - My Thanks to Audrey M!!!
424680,99221,5/6/2009,5,"GREAT, GREAT MUFFINS! Easy to make & wonderful tasting, too! I, too, am a sucker for lemons, & was happy to increase the amount of zest used! This is definitely a recipe keeper ~ Thanks for sharing it! [Tagged, made & reviewed in I Recommend Tag]"
329304,126789,2/1/2007,5,"I watched this be prepared on the Olive Garden's website and they had the recipe available as well.  So I gave it a try last night and let me tell you...it will not disappoint!  It was absolutely fabulous and easy to make.  The only changes I made was to use fetuccine instead of penne pasta and I simply seasoned the breasts first before dredging in flour.  Also, added just a tad more garlic (we love it!) and added some extra half and half to the 1/2 pint of cream.  It was so delicious and authentic tasting.  My DH was in heaven!  Needless to say, we will definately be making this again and again.  Thanks for posting!"
532179,126789,9/30/2007,4,"I'm a huge fan of this at Olive Garden.  This dish tastes very very similar.  I made this last night for guests and it came out excellent... except for my personal errors.  I was wrapped up in conversation with them and was distracted while preparing this... So, I only got a handful of spinach and half of a bell pepper in it.  It still turned out great.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was delish.  I used fresh linguine (I wanted fresh fettucine but my store was out).  Next time I will double the sauce recipe since we like extra for dipping.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!"
241579,126789,10/28/2007,5,"My husband just loved this dish. Only adjustments I had to make were to use sherry and frozen spinach--forgot both when I did the grocery shopping; and I also threw in about 1/4 c. monterey jack cheese in the sauce. Hubby is a cheese fanatic. I made the pasta and sauce first, which took me about 20 minutes (with a baby in my arms), and fifteen minutes before my husband got home, I threw the chicken in a pan to cook all the way through there. It was easier that way since I used chicken breast tenderloins; the pieces were smaller, so they cooked faster. The flavors were excellent! Thank you for posting!"
511690,126789,11/5/2007,4,"I loved this recipe! It's a shame we couldn't all grow up in Tuscany. This was the first time I ever attempted a cream sauce and it was a huge success.  I also ended up adding a little extra garlic.  I made the sauce a second time, but didn't have all the ingredients.  I've posted the variation for those of you who are also grocery store lazy"
111291,126789,11/11/2007,5,"I could NOT stop eating this!  It is soooooo full of FLAVOR!  Does take a little bit of time to make, but so worth it!  This is a ""company worthy"" recipe.  I made this lower fat by using fat free half and half instead of heavy cream and used olive oil spray in place of most of the oil. I also used whole grain organic penne. Delicious! I will be making this again!  Thanks for posting."
225566,126789,1/14/2008,5,"This was a very good dish, even the kids enjoyed it! The only problem I had was that the chicken was a little tough, I think I will saute it a little longer next time, and maybe leave out the breading, I also used fettuccine. It was delicious!! I will be cooking this again! Thank you for posting it! :)"
216320,126789,1/28/2008,3,"This was good, but I thought it could've had a little more flavor.  Seemed like alot of effort and mess for just a so-so result. Thanks anyway for posting."
756573,126789,5/13/2008,5,"I made this dish back in Feb 09, 2008. About the time I started cooking for the first time. Then it did seem like a lot of effort to make. The chicken then had very little flavor and the sauce came out thin. If I would have rated this dish then, it would have recieved 3 stars. I made this dish last night, and used the suggestions made by ~Lynn~ in a previous review. I seasoned the chicken with italian seasonings first before dredging in flour and also added more Half and Half. I halfed the recipe because it was just the two of us, but cooked the original amount of sauce so that I had plenty. It came together easy and more than pleased our appitite. Thanks Impera_Magna for the post, and kudos to ~Lynn~ for the great suggestions. :) -LB&B"
487387,126789,10/12/2008,5,"I have never had this dish from Olive Garden so I can't comment on how it compares. This dish turned out so good. I followed the recipe ""fairly close"" but did triple the garlic, because we love garlic, doubled the red pepper, and added mushrooms. It was a hit and a for sure make again."
1146413,126789,1/27/2009,5,"I tried this recipe and it was wonderful, very easy and very good."
252816,126789,2/7/2009,5,"First I omitted the 1 1/2c flour and 2 tsp It.herb seasoning.I used 1 chicken breast per serving,sliced  breast lengthwise 1/4""  pieces and dipped in beaten egg and then dredged in herb and garlic fine breadcrumbs and cooked in 5 tblsp olive oil.Then I cooked the garlic in oil leftover..I wanted more flavor and accomplished that by doing this method. I used roasted red peppers. And served over fettuccini pasta.This dish was quick and really good..A must for pasta lovers..."
40152,126789,3/21/2009,5,"The only changes I made was to use l/2 cup chicken broth plus l tbsp lemon to sub. for the wine which I didn't have. I also increased garlic. 
Using young spinach I didn't bother stemming it. Also used fettuccine pasta. 
This was just wonderful and heats up great for leftovers. 
DH says I should have flattened the breasts slightly. Not sure if I will as this could make a less juicy product."
326680,126789,4/12/2009,5,Two things the recipe is missing that Olive Garden doesn't tell you to put in it are roasted whole garlic cloves and chopped sun-dried tomatoes.  These with both add a couple more layers of flavor and make it that much more enjoyable.
625696,126789,7/11/2009,5,"Excellent!!  I've never had the original from OG, but I really want to try it now.  I scaled this down for 2, but there are still enough leftovers for another meal.  Only change I made was to add some chopped fresh basil over the top at the end.  Served with roasted green beans & asparagus."
1361318,126789,12/26/2009,5,"This was incredible! I havent had the original olive garden version either- but I dont think it could get much better than this! Instead of red peppers, I used a can of diced tomatoes that I had on had and it turned out great! Thanks!"
1408290,126789,12/29/2009,5,"I'm newly retired and just beginning to spend more time on cooking.  I felt like Julie and Julia when preparing this recipe and  loved the rave compliments I received from my better half.  I, also, halved the recipe for just the two of us.  We'll have leftovers tomorrow.  I'll bet it will taste even better then.  Thanks for sharing."
706608,126789,8/19/2010,5,Fabulous.
470351,126789,1/9/2011,5,"5 stars all the way....and then some!  I increased the garlic, increased the peppers and added crushed red peppers.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 in place of heavy cream and cut the amount down to about 1 cup.  Perfect instructions, and unbelievable flavor!  Will definitely make again!"
620763,126789,1/22/2011,4,"The creamy wine sauce turned out well, but the chicken was very bland. Next time I would add a lot more seasoning to the chicken or try coating it in breadcrumbs instead. To be fair, I've never tried the Olive Garden dish, but I do like my chicken more flavorful."
1903034,126789,5/6/2011,0,"Sure does sound delicious,  but OMG 1081 calories!!   I'm going to have to pass on trying this one."
376189,126789,5/15/2011,3,This had okay flavor and was very heavy. I probably wouldn't make it again.
222564,126789,11/9/2012,4,"Mmmmm.... I used radically more garlic, like 9 cloves. Only 1 cup of flour is needed also."
502095,126789,1/21/2013,5,"Very good! This was SO delicious.. I made directly as the recipe said and it was terrific. Some reviews said the chicken was bland, but I thought it was good. Especially if you eat with the wonderful creamy sauce from the noodles. The only thing I guess I did different was I just left the creamy sauce on the side and put it on top the noodles kind of like spaghetti instead of mixing it. I was afraid the sauce might soak into the noodles and then it wouldn't be very creamy. But either way it was mmmmmmmm... mmmmmmmm !! Whole family fave."
1595350,126789,2/8/2013,5,Very delicious dish!  It could use some mushrooms and fresh diced tomatoes if you ask me but overall VERY GOOD!
2891654,126789,7/6/2013,5,"I tweaked the recipe a bit.... didn&#039;t fry the chicken but instead I used spices, garlic powder and parm to grill the chicken 3 min on each side before placing in 350 oven.  I also added equal amount of julienne onion to sauce and used fat free cream in place of heavy cream.  I also used corn meal finely ground in place of flour to thicken so that my GF friend could try this recipe.  Turned out awesome but I can&#039;t compare to OG version since I only saw the commercial and decided to make a healthier version at home."
2837147,126789,11/3/2013,5,This is one of my top favorite recipes to make at home. Very easy to make. I modify the recipe only by adding a tablespoon or so of Oscar Meyer/Hormel Real Bacon Bits right before serving. Make enough for leftovers because it re-heats very well.
350812,193743,11/23/2006,3,"OK - I know this got 5 stars from EVERYONE on Cooking Light's website, but I don't know why.  This was my first time using a brine.  In the past I've always just used a Reynold's bag with some honey and butter.  Honestly - this recipe didn't taste much different.  No noticeable difference in the juicey-ness or tenderness.  I will admit that based on the reviews on Cooking Light, I didn't make the gravy.  I  brined per the recipe, then made the turkey per the second step, and then cooked it in a bag.  So - a good turkey, but not worth the effort in my opinion.  But thanks for sharing!"
303611,193743,5/12/2010,5,I've made this turkey recipe every year for 6 or 7 years for my family's Thanksgiving.  They insist!  It's the best turkey any of us have ever had.  Thanks for posting it on here for easy access!
302905,231162,6/26/2007,5,very good!!!
268501,231162,6/30/2007,5,"We loved this.  It's a keeper.  We made two changes. We substituted chives for the green onions, since that's what we had in the garden and added 10 oz. x-firm tofu with the chive, garlic and ginger mix to make it more of a meal.  DH, who did the cooking and who has very high standards, gave this 5 stars."
182010,243700,8/16/2007,0,"I had great difficulty in getting this recipe to work.   The gnocchi dough was way too soft and would not hold its shape.   As I am unsure whether the fault was with me, I am not rating the recipe."
89831,248111,9/11/2007,5,"great recipe, I added in fresh garlic and red chili flakes with the onions and oregano and omitted the garlic powder, I also increased the cumin, thanks ColCadsMom, my DS enjoyed this as a take-home meal ;)"
641014,248111,11/7/2007,5,"yum..I made this, ate some and froze the rest...again..yum!!"
76951,248111,11/11/2007,5,"This was very good - going into my ""Permanent Addition"" cookbook.  Instead of baking the chicken ahead, I cooked them in water to form its own broth.  I took Kittencal's advice and replaced the garlic powder with fresh, minced garlic and added some red pepper flakes. Thanks for great recipe that I'll be sure to make over and over during the winter."
841252,248111,11/11/2008,5,Absolutely awesome.  Went to Calhoun's to do a taste comparison.  This is very close!  It's better the 2nd day and if you let it simmer for a while.  I mash beans to thicken it instead of using cornstarch.  Very very good! Thanks!!!
1801598265,248111,12/30/2013,5,We never miss an opportunity to stop for their white chili. Sometimes two visits in the week we are there.  Sooooo good. I am going to attempt it. I highly recommend it.
1803632268,248111,9/28/2016,5,"Like some others, I boiled and deboned a chicken...not sure why you would to it any other way. There may be a minor difference in flavor if you bake the chicken as called for, but I doubt it...and never pass up the chance for almost a gallon of great broth. At any rate, I made this pretty much exactly according to the recipe and it was quite good. I did use a whole 4 oz. can of the chopped green chilies which is about double. It could have used a bit more heat for my tastes, but the folks at work devoured it."
1800036218,248111,10/27/2018,5,"I have made this chili for about 25+ years. I originally got the recipe when it was printed in the Knoxville News Sentinel. I have misplaced my copy, googled the recipe and found it on this forum. I boil my chicken first to keep it moist and to make a broth. I then shred it with my Kitchen Aid Mixer while it's still hot. This makes it the perfect consistency. This and the Calhoun's Spinach Maria recipes are my go to recipes. Of course since I never buy either at the restaurant any longer as they just don't measure up to the at-home versions. I hope everyone who tried this enjoys it as much as my family and I do."
376580,251502,9/14/2007,5,"This was a very good dish!  We loved it!  I had to double it for my large crew, but other than that it was delicious!!!"
192803,303456,5/13/2009,5,I used to buy their chili every morning for breakfast. This is almost identical. I love it!!
1402180,303456,10/2/2009,3,"Just in the middle of making this recipe, it does seem very watery, had I'd known I would have mashed some extra beans on the side to thinken the chili. It does in no way taste like Tim Hoetons.."
488817,303456,11/7/2009,5,YUMMM!! This recipe was soooo tasty!! Even the ones in the family who don't like chili ate this! Thanks for sharing!  I did add mushrooms though since we love mushrooms :)
837152,330614,1/19/2009,5,"We loved these bars!  I used granny smith apples, and the tart with the sweet from the caramel was a match made in heaven!   These will be requested again.  Thank you for sharing!"
936601,337971,4/8/2009,5,"We really enjoyed this!  I subbed Splenda for the sugar, which worked great for me, and I agree! Everything is better with butter. Just right for DH and I thanks buzzsau!  I will make this again!  Made for 2009 Spring PAC"
424680,337971,4/15/2010,5,"Definitely a winning recipe for us, but then we do love our brownies! Easy to make, too, which is a plus! At the end, howeveer, I used just a very, very light dusting of the powdered sugar! I look forward to making these the next time I host one of my monthly groups! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in the current Pick A Chef event]"
1378827,345181,11/23/2009,0,This recipe is incomplete.  The mirlitons and shrimp are missing!
2535494,345181,11/30/2012,0,This is not a recipe.  Please complete it if it is going to be posted on here.
1441971,398528,11/9/2009,5,Add a little sour cream and its delicious!
860079,398528,4/15/2010,5,I made this for our dinner last night and it was delicious ~ I didn't even miss the fact that it didn't have any meat in it. I made as written except I used fresh spinach ~ it was spicy good! I also made it in my crock pot so it was super easy. Thanks for posting ~ made for Spring PAC 2010!
724516,398528,4/17/2010,5,"Mmmm!!! this is a very good soup, I have a fantastic chopper that chops every thing so quick that I had it on the stove top in no time. I liked the chilli in it I also used fresh spinach as I had it in my fridge. I think it would be great for the crock pot also, maybe next time as I was in a hurry for it today. Made for PAC Spring 2010 thank's for posting."
2000248107,398528,6/4/2015,5,"I substituted black beans for green beans and used ham-flavored stock, which I buy granulated.  I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  Otherwise true to the recipe, I put everything in the crockpot raw, and cooked it on high for 6 hours.  The vegetables maintained color, so the soup tastes as good as it looks.  Thank you!  Good stuff!"
21618,10602,10/20/2001,5,Excellent
22642,17262,9/11/2005,5,"These come out very well. I made a half recipe so I got 2 ""logs"" in the freezer. Great for late night or last minute snacks. "
412493,17262,2/14/2007,5,"How awesome is this??! I can send home home-made ready to bake cookies with my ""kids"" and they get the pleasure of smelling them bake w/o the fuss! Thanks! Makwa"
67656,17262,9/20/2008,5,"I often get requests for cookies and baked goods but sometimes don't have time to prepare them so this seems like an ideal solution.  Also, there was a NYT article where several world class bakers noted that chilling chocolate chip cookie dough yields a superior result.  Tonight I made a batch,  half was popped in the freezer for just an hour and baked, the rest frozen for later.  The batch baked tonight was superb  with the brown sugar giving that classic part-crispy-part chewy texture. I did find the recipe needed more chips but that's a matter of personal taste.  Updated 9/19: Baked off my frozen batch and they were different but also superb.  The cookies were crisper on the outside with a delightful slightly chewy brown sugary interior. The crowd loved 'em."
214008,17262,3/15/2009,5,"This is a wonderful recipe, I probably added 3 cups of choc chips and 1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts. I made 3 dozen good sized cookies without freezing the dough and then I made 3 rolls out of the remainder. This was my first attempt at making cookie dough to freeze and I'm so pleased how easy it was. Thank you for a lovely cookie recipe and everyone loved them. Will be making them again soon and love that I have some in the freezer ready to go.........chris"
513230,17262,1/4/2010,5,I used this recipe for the chocolate chip cookie base of recipe #178756. It was the perfect compliment to it and very delicious.
169750,17262,1/22/2010,5,"These were really good cookies, I will be making this again.  I just made 1 dozen, just to test it.. now I have to make more. :-)"
354675,17262,9/19/2013,5,"Making extra dough and freezing it is the only way to go! These were great, easy and they make a ton. I&#039;m going to make them again in a month or two, stockpile in my freezer and use for easy holiday gifts."
1800137054,17262,12/26/2013,5,Very good cookies. I will use this recipe from now on.
52448,69243,9/10/2003,5,"Simple and very tasty, the basil was especially good with this. I used the smoked paprika and the only different thing I did was sprinkling some more finely chopped basil on the chicken when I served it. "
231529,69243,7/27/2005,0,Penzey's Spices (www.penzeys.com) has recently started carrying smoked paprika.  You can order through the mail or online.  I personally love their stuff - never gotten anything I've been unhappy with from them.
71772,69243,11/6/2006,5,"I LOVED this!  Hubby did, too, but he thought it was a bit spicy.  You could easily cut back on the cayenne and still get the same flavours.  The only change I had was to use 1 teaspoon dried basil instead of the fresh.  I served this with lemon barley pilaf and brussels sprouts."
432201,69243,3/6/2007,5,This recipe was great. My kids loved it. I used regular paprika 'cause that's what I had in house. Worked well.
13796,69243,3/11/2007,5,"Very good! I've been looking for ways to use my smoked paprika. This was easy, too."
192264,69243,4/25/2007,5,"My kids loved this. I only had regular paprika, and I used about 2/3 the amount of cayenne. The kids gave it 5 stars & want it again. Thanks."
306106,69243,10/10/2007,3,"Really enjoyed the chicken, but the basil died out as far as flavor goes. Maybe next time I would add the basil at the very end before serving. I served it with garlic-basil mashed potatoes. YUM! Thanks, Jan!"
594620,69243,11/8/2007,5,"This dish was simple and absolutely outstanding.  I used flattened chicken breasts from Costco.  They're uniform thickness for easier, faster cooking.  They cooked on med-high for  3 to 4 minutes a side and turned out perfectly.  When looking at this recipe, I was thinking I'd need to go out and buy some smoked paprika. After a little research, I learned Spanish Paprika IS smoked paprika and we already have that.  I minced the garlic instead of keeping it crushed.  I left the spice marinade on the breasts for probably close to an hour as I ran behind on my other parts of the meal.  It was great, even after having marinated for so long.  PERFECT.  I served mine with recipe #37106 and recipe #162736.  Very nice dinner.  My husbanf loved, loved, loved it."
313487,69243,2/21/2008,5,"Awesome chicken! I didnt have smoked paprika, but just regular and it still came out so good. I used 1tsp of salt and 1tbsp of dried basil and a bit more garlic than called for. I also let it sit for maybe close to an hour before cooking. Very good and we will be having this again. Thanks for a great, simple recipe!"
797486,69243,7/29/2008,4,"Pretty good chicken recipe. Unfortunately, I couldn't get any smoked paprika, so I had to use regular Hungarian. Still tasty, though! I would add a bit more garlic and cayenne next time, though. I couldn't really taste them. The basil was a wonderful complement to the paprika. Thanks for the recipe!"
217615,69243,1/5/2009,5,This turned out really well!! I added a very small amout of liquid smoke (I didn't have smoked Paprika) and it turned out fine. I used the left overs in Chicken noodle soup and it was wonderful
204116,69243,2/3/2009,5,"DW and I found this very tasty. The smoked paprika definitely gave the dish a smokey flavor.

I did bake this in the oven to allow me to tend to other things rather than the stove top method. I put it in a 350F oven for 25 minutes."
461724,69243,3/11/2009,3,"This was good but just not a ""wow"" recipe for us.  Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup Game."
55655,69243,6/29/2009,5,We loved this. I used a beautiful smoked paprika (which is hard to find) and all the rest of the ingredients as per the recipe. I did let it marinate for about 2 hours and then we barbequed it. Excellent!
1163252,69243,3/28/2010,5,"I was skeptical about trying this recipe since I did not have all of the exact ingredients.  I substituted smoked paprika for plain ol regular paprika and a few dashes of liquid smoke, I used italian seasoning which consist of basil, rosemary thyme, etc. I used dried garlic instead of cloves of crushed garlic.  I used garlic salt instead of salt.  Anyways it came out delicious! The hubby was happy with it, and so was I!"
904655,69243,5/7/2010,5,Smoked paprika is what makes this dish..... I have made this a few times now using the grill pan.. its wondeful.. the flavor and presentation is very gourmet....give it a go guys.. you won't be disappointed!!
844554,69243,10/30/2010,5,I also baked mine in the oven. I used garlic powder instead of garlic. Definitely smokey flavor. Very good.
50969,69243,2/3/2011,4,"I made this recipe on 2/2/10 as a part of mine and SO's dinner.Since it was just the two of us, three chicken breasts were used( I saved one for leftovers)But for the marinade the full amount was made and the paprika was a blend of Smoked Spanish and a bit of Sweet California.The taste was very good and with the blend of two different paprikas, the chicken had a bit of sweet,smokey taste to it.This recipe will be made again.Thanks for taking the time to post,and "" Keep Smiling :) """
571308,69243,2/9/2011,5,I don't know how I managed to miss this recipe for so long because I love the flavor of smoked paprika. I made this recipe as written except I used chicken tenders and baked them in the oven. We really loved the flavor of the chicken. I've frozen the remaining tenders and will use them in a wrap of some sort.
550949,69243,6/24/2011,4,Very nice! I cooked the chicken on a grill pan. I had some leftover marinade that I used on sweet potatoes. Overall would make again with a little more spice.
928301,69243,11/29/2011,5,"this is lovely!  I just used regular paprika & 2 chicken breasts but didn't change anything else so double the flavor & I enjoyed every bite.  Hardly any trouble--just throw the ingredients into the bag, leave it there 20 minutes then cook it on the stove.   I love this recipe!"
1991853,69243,11/25/2012,5,"Easy, delicious, and healthy! I made this for my week-ahead cooking. Baked at 350 for 25 minutes as another reviewer suggested. Let it cool, then bagged it up for self-serve during the week. Everyone enjoyed it. The chicken was moist and flavorful. <br/><br/>I wasn't actually sold on the ingredient list when I first saw it, but figured I'd follow it to a tee (except the cooking method) to see what it was like. Then I would improvise. I'm making another batch this week and honestly feel no need to improvise. Thanks for a great keeper recipe, Jan!"
2479166,69243,1/9/2014,0,"This was good! Not too spicy. Could add more cayenne if you like some real heat, but good as written. I only used 3 breasts and cut them up into chunks.  Served with green beans and wild rice. Next time I might try wilting leaf spinach in the pan once the chicken is cooked to soak up some of the extra oil and spices in the pan."
165933,69243,6/1/2014,5,"I just sent this recipe to my daughter, per her request and realized that I&#039;ve neglected to rate the recipe.  I did not change the recipe at all and it was fantastic.  I have marinated for 1 hour and even overnight with fantastic results.  Regular paprika would probably be ok but the smoked takes the chicken to a higher level!  Thank you."
2002124869,69243,5/28/2018,5,The flavor is excellent. Smoked paprika is one of my favorite spices to cook with.
1248774,71425,3/18/2010,1,I have to say this is nothing like the fettucine I have made and eaten.This just a casserole with these ingredients. I won't be making this again.
377161,71425,1/31/2014,5,Loved this recipe!!! Delicious!! Good thing I ignore other people&#039;s reviews and go by taste as I will be making this one again!!! Thank You for posting!!!
113470,72218,11/24/2003,4,"Very nice.  I used chicken not lamb, optional green olives (with pimento), skipped optional chickpeas (just didn't happen to have them on hand, but usually love them), and potatoes not squash (same reason).  Skipped red pepper for my toddler's sake (DH can and does add at table).  One addition:  at the end, I added 1 Tbl cornstarch in 3 Tbl cold water slurry to the sauce for the last half hour, to give the sauce more body.  Did the trick, and didn't get gloppy.  Dish cooked up tender and flavorful.  Husband liked it, toddler loved it, especially the carrots (as usual).  "
169443,72218,10/25/2004,4,"Very nice.  I used the cayenne instead of the flakes, rubbed the meat with the spice/garlic mixture, and piled everything else on top before pouring in the broth. I also added 1 can of condensed tomato soup at the end with the chickpeas to meld the flavors and thicken the sauce."
171303,72218,11/5/2004,4,"The smell of this dish when I walked in after work was heavenly. I did omit the salt and the olives as DH is on low sodium diet, used low sodium versions of the canned items and increased the hot pepper since he likes things spicy. We both enjoyed this dish and look forward to making it a comfort food standard. Thanks for the great recipe. "
189705,72218,2/5/2005,5,"The spices in this dish give it a great, exotic taste.  I followed the recipe with chicken thighs & potatoes and used all of the optional ingredients (Italian green olives and garbonzo beans) and it turned out great!  I served it over couscous with mango chutney on the side and everyone loved it."
236493,72218,8/16/2005,5,"Oh my gosh! This was so flavorful and delicious! Instead of lamb or chicken thighs, I used a whole chicken cut up (skin on) and used the olives and chickpeas. I cooked it for about 9 hours on low and the meat was falling off the bone, so tender and so good! Invited some friends over and served it on couscous. They loved it! And so did I! Definitely a keeper."
312117,72218,4/19/2006,5,"I can't say how much I love this dish! I have made it many times, in fact it is bubbling away right now! I followed another reviewers advice to add tomato soup. It does make the sauce thicker. Beautiful dish and the smells throughout the house is heavenly!"
124416,169916,4/3/2009,5,"A Keeper!  Almost too soft and fluffy!  A nice flavor.  And they keep well.  I subbed oil for the shortening and honey for the sugar; that worked well.  Thanks, Engineer, for posting. . . Janet"
295704,72218,9/7/2006,3,"This was very good, but...the spices messed with my DH tummy and my children didn't like it at all. Not a very good recipe for families with small children or sensitive tummies. Though I do have to tell you, I decided to not cut up the potatoes, instead a few minutes before serving I took them out and mashed them up, then I threw in a stick of butter and some milk to cream it up. It was the only thing my kids did eat. Thanks anyway."
408801,72218,1/27/2007,5,"Great recipe I made this for my family when my mom was busy, and they all seemed to like it (despite their fear of change). I made it with the chickpeas, but without the olives because we were out.  The second time around at college I added a package of okra around because it enhanced the color and thickness of the broth.. also i like gumbo and okra so i always have some on stock."
290163,72218,6/21/2007,4,"Very good recipe!  We couldn't afford 3 lbs of lamb so we used a 1 lb lamb neck.  Just enough to flavor, but not enough to break the bank.  I feel a little silly for eating this during the summer!  It's definitely a winter meal!"
510313,72218,2/8/2008,4,"I cooked this for dinner today as part of the GREAT TAGINE TREASURE HUNT & am very happy I did! It is delicious. I followed the recipe but added a bit of chopped fresh coriander / cilantro at the end. I don't have a crock pot so I cooked it in my LE Creuset dutch oven/ casserole for just short of 3 hours & it was perfect. We ate it with steamed raisin cous cous.

Thanks B.T for the great recipe!"
502302,72218,10/10/2008,4,I liked this a lot. Hubby hated it but he hates anything with cumin in it so I didn't let that affect the rating. I made it with 8 chicken thighs and portioned it into 4 huge servings. It was only 300 very filling calories. I followed the rest of the ingredients exact including using pumpkin for the squash. I got started too late so I cooked it on the stovetop. I removed the lid in the last 30 min of cooking because it was still too soupy for my liking. I used the pepper flakes and the spice was almost too much for us. Maybe I will use 1/4 tsp in the future.
220433,72218,2/17/2012,3,I am a big fan of Moroccan cuisine but I am sorry I did not care for this. I made it exactly per the recipe using beef. I served it with Garlic Naan and a Mixed Green Salad with Pear and Gorgonzola dressing from Trader Joe's. I am chalking it up to eating a bunch of Girl Scout cookies and the mix of flavors though since everyone else seems to like this.
1971865,72218,11/10/2012,5,"This was really, really good. Took me right back to my first tajine experience in Morocco. My husband is wary of new flavor combos but really liked it. The kids even ate it (OK, there was dessert on the line...). Definitely a keeper in our recipe book! We tried with the beef but will try other combos too. Makes a ton, we had leftovers for several days. We cooked up two boxes of couscous for this and ran out of couscous first -- next time I'll make 3 boxes."
13483,82938,4/11/2004,4,These were really good and easy to put together.  The coconut went well with it but it did somewhat overpower the delicate shrimp taste.  It was more a coconut flavour than shrimp.  But it still was good. Do spray the baking dish well as they tend to stick to the dish.  
129333,82938,4/14/2004,4,"This was very good I thought the coconut went well with the shrimp taste and balanced nicely. Maybe my shrimp had a stronger taste.
I would use small plates rather then bowls to dredge the shrimp. It was quite a mess to make and the shrimp was not really crsipy even after about 17 min. Still I would make them again "
116854,88086,8/26/2004,5,"I took this cake to work as a treat for my co-workers.  Everyone loved it!  I was barely able to save the last piece to bring home for my DH!  I followed the recipe exactly, using toasted ground pecans.  My bananas were pretty ripe, but not black.  The cake was very moist and flavorful.  For the topping, I used less milk, and made an icing instead of a glaze.  I also added about 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon to the icing.  This is a wonderful way to use ripe bananas...I will be making this again!"
146149,88086,10/15/2004,5,"Ok, here's my twist on this:
Try using a 1/2 cup of banana milk, use 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp banana extract!!!! Also used 1/2 cup light brown sugar and 1 cup white for added flavour!

Now THAT's banana cake!!!!!"
253974,88086,11/18/2005,5,"A neighbor gave me 3 bananas that were extremely ripe and I set about looking for the perfect cake to build around them. This cake was so moist and delicious! My hubby, who isn't fond of ""flavored"" cakes except chocolate was very happy with it. Neighbors agreed. One neighbor kept apologizing as he helped himself to not one, but three helpings! Thanks for sharing!"
177135,88086,5/15/2006,5,Yummy !!!  Made this little winner yesterday for Mother's Day....and we all loved it !  I didn't do the glaze...but did a cream cheese frosting.  I made this in 2 round tins and then frosted.  Outstanding flavour! I used the walnuts but think that next time I will just have the bananas...and cream cheese frosting!  What a winner! Thanks so much for posting !
173579,88086,7/23/2006,5,This cake taste great.  Very moist and flavorful.  The glaze just made the cake.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
13667,4527,8/3/2001,5,"tried this recipe on my boyfriend, who dislikes asian food of ant sort. didn't tell him
name of recipe or ingred., until after when he said he loved it. we have had it several
times since. have brought to pot luck dinner parties... every one who has tasted it,
raved."
400708,95621,3/29/2012,4,I've never made anything with eggplant before but have enjoye it out; this recipe was a chance to try it out and was easy and tasted so good.  DH even commented on how nice dinner was and that we must have this again.  Only thing that would have helpe this novice eggplant baker more would have been advice on how thick to cut the eggplant.  All in all a very nice dinner that we will be enjoying again.  Made for Spring PAC 2012
4470,101781,10/14/2004,5,"Meatloaf, some leftover  soup & Pammy's Awesome gravy recipe equals one fine tasting dinner.   I had about 3/4 cup of mushroom soup in the fridge so I scaled down your recipe.  It was so easy with great flavor.  Thanks Chef#166103 for a neat shortcut for a quick gravy"
168257,101781,10/18/2004,5,Excellent!  I love it.  Almost as good as my grandmother's old fashioned pan browned gravy.
160974,101781,2/28/2007,5,"We had guests for dinner and I made  this to go with turkey meatloaf. This really tasted like great gravy and not just mushroom soup! I was surprised that it didn't taste too salty, either, since I usually find that with the canned soups (used regular beef broth and Healthy Choice  Mushroom soup). This made our dinner really special. I am already thinking turkey broth to make a turkey gravy, too. Thanks Packer Backer Pammy."
161282,101781,9/20/2012,5,"Made this gravy to go with recipe #272759 (Crock Pot Meatloaf) and they were a match made in heaven. This is a smooth, creamy gravy that takes only minutes to prepare. It would be good with turkey or beef as well. Thanks for sharing, Pammy!"
2579303,101781,12/21/2012,0,"LOVE this recipe. Tonight I added a bit of Kitchen Bouquet to darken it, and a little white wine for tang. Stirred in a bit of Wondra flour to thicken more, and served over hot meatloaf sandwiches. This got a thumbs up from the diners. Thanks, Pammy!"
28177,163343,3/28/2010,5,"I just LOVED this recipe!  The flavor is outstanding.  I was literally just using up extra ingredients in my fridge (capers, green olives & parsley) & couldn't believe I stumbled on your recipe that uses them all.  I made as directed except did not have the black olives on hand.  I'll make sure to use them next time though.  The only complaint was that the chicken got a little dry during cooking, but we're looking forward to trying this again with chicken thighs.  Thanks for sharing, Eva!  You've been adopted during Pick A Chef Spring 2010!  http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=327498"
1967465,163343,7/26/2011,1,very bland
407386,163632,4/12/2008,0,I like that I can thicken the sauce it makes it a  more filling great dish! Thanks for sharing:)
284897,219720,11/4/2007,5,"Such a wondeful and easy addition to add when roasting chicken. I found that the chicken seemed a little more succulent and tender. The chicken had a fantastic light Lemoney taste through it.
For just a few extra minutes work  beforehand, you get such a wonderful and great tasting roast chicken. Who would of thought something so easy could make such a difference!!
Great recipe **Jubes**. This is my new way of roasting chicken!!! Thanks."
65502,219720,6/19/2010,5,This is very tasty! I made as directed except that I BBQ'd this on the rotisserie. I really liked the simplicity and moistness of this. I had this with mixed veggies and Recipe #263392. Very very good! Made for the No-Nonsense Nibblers for ZWT6. Thanks ***Jubes***! :)
195589,219720,6/21/2010,5,"We enjoyed this very much. I did add some Lawry's Seasoning Salt. It was moist and delicious! Thanks for posting, Jubes.
Made for ZWt 6."
312455,232985,7/28/2007,5,"I used yellow and red bell peppers, omitting the green bell.  This was a very colorful and tasty salad, not too hard to make. It went really well with a slice of warmed up wheat naan bread."
251917,232985,6/22/2008,5,"ZWT4: This is a delightful, unique salad. I really enjoyed this!"
780172,232985,6/27/2008,5,"This was quite good, my husband even liked it, said that it was refreshing and not too, too spicey. It also is a very pretty salad. Made for ZWT4."
568297,263383,11/21/2007,2,"I was a bit confused by the directions on this. It states to reach a hard ball stage. Which would be a bit over 125 C on a sugar thermometer. I went with the hard ball stage, and I think it tastes burnt, and looks burnt as well. Im not sure if hard ball stage is the correct temp here. Made for fall 07 Photo game."
574374,4527,9/17/2007,5,We really liked this chicken dish. I only used 1/2 tbsp. of hot pepper sauce as some of the family does not do spicy foods that well and it still had plenty of kick for me and hubby. I also used 2 lbs. of chicken breast witout adding additional ingredients and it turned out great. Still enough sauce for each breast. Thanks for sharing this one!
458219,4527,11/30/2007,2,"Good flavor, but I feel it is better used as just a marinade or BBQ sauce. It is may too strong to be pored over your meal."
199848,55778,4/8/2008,5,"Super flavor!  The 2 tbsp of curry powder was the perfect amount without being overpowering.  The fresh parsley gives a nice fresh flavor, too.  I made this as written, but added the tomatoes at the end with the chopped parsley.  Thanx for posting; I'll make this again."
437727,55778,4/8/2009,5,"Love this! 
Forgot to rate after I made, just got leftovers out of freezer.....WONDERFUL!"
1369440,55778,8/30/2009,5,"I really enjoyed this soup. However, I made a few adjustments. I used garlic infused olive oil and added 2 more cloves (I LOVE garlic). Also I added a cup or so of carrots, quartered and diced, and 4 medium sized red skin potatoes. And I added an extra half cup of lentils. I substituted chicken stock with veg. broth so it was vegan. This soup was a delight and the curry made it really delicious. However, I wish I didnt put in the parsley."
517144,55778,1/15/2010,5,"Interesting twist on a classic soup.  Loved all the flavors.  When I made it the second time, I decided to experiment a bit & used beef broth.  Also, I added about a tsp of cumin and a couple of squeezes of cilantro from the tube (usually found in the produce section next to the refrigerated salad dressings).  Try this soup--you'll put it into your rotation for sure!!"
1360121,55778,2/2/2010,5,Quite nice.  I used a hot curry and it was great.
249519,152660,11/7/2006,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed this, as did my husband, kids, and 2 guests!  It was very easy, and had a great flavor.  I surely will be making this again.  Some notes:  The caraway, which is optional, is what really made the dish delicious and a bit different.  I used chicken leg quarters, which I cut, removing whatever fat I could.  For ease, I used my food processor to chop the garlic and parsley, then added the Italian dressing, 1 t. salt and some pepper.  Marinated in a freezer bag overnight.  I cut the carrots into chunks and used lots more - they were the first to go, so I do recommend lots if your family eats them.   I added 3 small onions to my clay pot, and next time, I think I'll also add some cut up cabbage.  Also, the chicken will make its own juice in the pot.  After cooking, I put the chicken in a pan under the broiler for a couple of minutes to further brown/crisp it, removed the veggies to a serving dish, and defatted the chicken liquid to serve alongside.  Yum!  Thanks again, Angela, for a winning recipe.  This was one of my choices for Pick-a-Chef, and now I'm sure glad I played!"
537524,152660,7/15/2007,5,I love the caraway seeds with this!  I may never make chicken without them again.  Fantastic recipe!!
2855381,152660,6/8/2013,5,"Great. I chose some other vegetables, but followed your recipe. Fantastic:&lt;br/&gt;Here are some pics of it:&lt;br/&gt;http://imgur.com/a/2UuIV"
2000486641,152660,1/2/2016,0,I&#039;m cooking this now in my clay pot. I did not notice that the chicken is to be cut up and it&#039;s baking whole. Any suggestions?
355702,189128,11/30/2006,5,"Hi there,
I just know I will love this recipe!! I really love Thai food and everything in this recipe sounds wonderful!! I will try it soon! Thank you so much for posting it!
Love,
Becky"
289680,189128,2/18/2007,4,"very good soup! i couldn't find lime leaves, and i could taste the difference without them. so i definitely need to find them before i make this again (hopefully soon!). my store also didn't have lemongrass stalks, only dried, so i had to make do. other than that, i made everything just as you'd written and i greatly enjoyed it!"
138174,189128,11/20/2008,3,"This soup is good, but does lack the zing without the fresh ingredients.  Kaffir lime leaves, lemon grass, fresh hot chili's if you cannot find Thai hot, then even serrano or cayenne would do ok. Galangal ginger is more fragrant, but I have substituted fresh Jamaican ginger and it is ok.   Instead of white mushrooms,try canned straw mushrooms (traditional) or dried shitake instead as they have more flavor. Try looking for ingredients in an asian market or they do sell Tom Yum soup base now in packets in oriental sections of major supermarkets."
1275380,189128,3/2/2010,5,"I say yum yum to Tom Yum!  My brother went to Thailand and brought back a bunch of spices for me as a gift.  So, I searched recipes by ingredients.  This was my first try with the new-to-me ingredients and it came out tasty.  I used dried Thai red hot peppers and dried lemon grass, as well as three baked and cubed chicken breasts and ginger powder instead of fresh ginger.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Easy, yummy, interesting.  Five stars from me."
230860,207072,4/9/2008,5,These were very good potatoes. I used a mix of mint and parsley since my aerogarden didn't have enough mint yet. I especially loved the garlic in these which I allowed to heat up in them a bit at the end to get rid of that raw garlic taste. Very simple too!
2001392037,207072,3/7/2017,0,I'm going to try using mint with sliced potatoes and carrots...in the oven. Anyone else try baking vegetables with mint?
278516,220100,4/19/2008,4,"Delicious!
We halved the recipe & used our own roasted red peppers ('capsicum' in Australia) that came from our garden.
The 2 hours in the fridge melded the flavours together beautifully.
I think lime juice would make 5 stars. 
Thanks for sharing! :)"
220023,262052,10/31/2007,5,i made this several yrs ago but lost recipe thanks for posting it again.i will make it again
333017,262052,4/30/2009,4,"I had made this recipe many, many years ago.  I had to stop making this because it became  very addicting!!!  I used to make it for gifts at Christmas!  If you like popcorn...you will think you have gone to heaven for this!!!"
334126,287210,7/23/2008,0,"A very good recipe. I added cream cheese to and mixed the chips right in the batter. Took them to my office and was asked to make them again next week.
A+++++++"
1290053,306392,6/7/2009,4,This absolutely rocks.  I am making it for the second time today and adding anchovy fillets into the incisions with the garlic.  Should be a winner
2001294418,306392,12/12/2016,4,"I added rosemary, And browned it first on stove, it was delicious. The dough was important, Because my got dry last two hours. And actually was ready at hour 5 and falling apart at hour 6. Attached photo after browning , before cooking in oven."
1165039,353262,2/10/2009,5,"This recipe is excellent.  The cilantro/corriander at the end really sets the dish off.  I have 2 little boys (2 & 6mos) so time is not a luxury I have.  I cut the tomato & onion while they were sleeping.  I put the dish on to cook as directed, and it was ready in the time suggested.  I would probalby add a touch more spice to it (cumin & pepper), but I did not have curry powder so did not use it.  The beans were also enough, but not too much like some other dishes with beans & rice.  5 stars based on taste, ease, and healthiness."
601714,353262,3/6/2009,5,This recipe is outstanding. My famliy and I are eating better and we came across this recipe. WOW factor is high. We could not stop eating it. We had 3 and 4 helping of the rice. KEEPER!!!
544202,353262,3/23/2009,5,"This recipe is awesome!!!   I use brown  Basmati rice which I saute as suggested with  the garlic and onion. I then cook the mixture along with the chicken broth in a rice cooker then add the remaining ingrediants. This is recipe is so great, I am able to prep everything while my 6 month old sleeps then combine the remaining ingrediants for a great dinner. Thank you Danya01 for a great recipe!!"
1230435,353262,4/8/2009,5,"Great, easy and delicious  - besides being healthy ! I will make this again."
382280,353262,2/23/2010,5,This is a wonderful recipe that we will definitely make on a regular basis. Thanks for posting..we really enjoyed it!
133174,353262,12/14/2010,5,I am attracted to this recipe because of the brown rice and fresh tomatoes.  It did not disappoint.  I loved the combination of spices.  This is a recipe I will safe to make again.  Thank you for sharing.
1804748,353262,1/23/2011,4,"I was attracted to this recipe because the spices looked as though they would add great flavor.  I adapted it to suit our tastes and used white rice, added 1/4 cup white wine to the rice after heating it in the oil so it would be more flavorful.  I used frozen italian tomatoes from our garden and chopped them before adding.  I added prepackaged  and precooked turkey/chicken with sun dried tomato and mozzarella sausage cut on the diagonal after everything was done just to heat the sausage.  It was YUMMY!  We all love this recipe and will make it often, of course with our ""tweaks"" and whatever else we have on hand.  I would have given 5 stars but I really think the wine added more flavor.  Oh, and I was light on the hot stuff.  Our granddaughter cannot tolerate it and neither can I.  It seems that a lot of recipes today have a lot of hot peppers in them."
291568,368428,3/18/2011,2,I found this rather bland and a little dry. Couldn't even smell it cooking when I came through the door!
844554,384436,9/21/2009,4,"I needed to use up some red potatoes and went looking through my recipes to try and this easy one popped out at me. I like the fact there is no mayo. I followed the recipe exactly except I cut it in half. The only thing is I don't know why there's 1 tbsp of olive oil plus the 1/2 cup of olive oil. It didn't matter to me because I just used 1/4 cup. Just curious, though. Going in the keeper file. Thanks."
446143,384436,3/31/2010,5,"My husband loved this.  I followed the recipe exactly, only subbing canned chopped jalapenos in place of fresh.  Thank you for this ""different"" potato salad!"
1802772108,506220,5/26/2014,5,wow they taste really good
26584,26320,5/4/2002,4,"This is really refreshing spinach.  I stayed on recipe all the way. Next time I will add the cilantro after the spinach is wilted, as I am kind of slow; and it took rather longer than a minute to wilt that much spinach.  Also, I would rather the garlic and chili were given somewhat more of a chance to cook.  Maybe sauté them in another pan for a minute and a half, or hold off on the lime for a minute.   At any rate this takes the usual ingredients and makes them into something exotic and special.  Most adult. We can eat and enjoy this, while telling the children, &#8220;Ya-ya, you don&#8217;t get any: its spinach.&#8221;"
57500,26320,11/3/2002,4,made it just like you instructed. very tasty and light. mmmmmm... i would saute the garlic and jalepenos first then add the spinach and cilantro in future attempts. thanks!
171303,26320,6/25/2009,4,This was a nice change of pace for sauteed spinach.  I too would saute the peppers and garlic first next time and then add the spinach.  Loved the lime which brightened al the flavors.  Thank you Sue L for sharing the recipe.
248287,86774,10/21/2005,4,"delicious, flavorful soup! I doubled the potato amount and added 1T chopped jalapeno. Yummy! A large dollop of yogurt really made it special!"
176574,86774,9/1/2006,5,"I love this soup and will make it again. It was the coconut that made me try it and I wasn't disappointed. I was relunctant to rate it though, because I made a rather large change. I do not like blended soup, so I chopped spinach and potatoes and took about 1.5 times the amount of them given in the recipe to make the soup thicker without having to blend it. Worked great for me. - Thanks alot for a new favorite. "
41602,99020,10/16/2005,1,"I don't know if I did it wrong, but this didn't turn out like I expected. The bread cube mixture was sparce & wouldn't ""spread"" in the bottom of the pan, nor was there enough to ""spread"" on the top. It turned out burnt around the edges & with very little ""betty"" as compared to apples. I may try this one again & re-rate/review, but for now I didn't like it."
243224,123506,3/17/2007,5,"Oh my word is this good!  We had this with Irish Oatmeal for St. Patty's Day Breakfast.  I made exactly as indicated except I ran out of butter (my kids had made cookies for a party).  So I used the tiny amount of butter I had on hand, about 1 Tablespoon, then subbed the other 3 T. with grapeseed oil (actually lowered the saturated fat that way).   Then I added just a pinch of salt.  The fruit comes out soft and plump, and the topping is like warm granola.  I will definitely be making this again.  I served it with plain yogurt that had been sweetened slightly with honey."
482933,130665,8/30/2013,5,"Made as posted with no extra salt and about 1/8 teaspoon of black pepper.  Because it is thundering here, I made in oven and had in quite a while and adjusted oven temperature halfway through so can&#039;t share opinion.  Next time I would slice the carrots thinner than 1/4 inch as they were more crispy than I like. Served with recipe#387276.  TY baby girl."
164538,169916,5/30/2006,5,"YUMM! I absolutely loved this recipe!
I made both Hamburger and Hot Dog buns and they came out perfect. I didnt change anything in the recipe. But I did change the baking time to 8 mins since my oven seems to run a little high. As soon as the buns cooled I put them in the freezer and look forward to having some burgers as well as using the hot dog buns for hot dogs and lunch meat sandwiches at work which I make with single serve lunch meat packs in various flavors like turkey or beef, slices of cheeze, dill pickle slices and onions with mayo. Along with some soup you've got a great lunch!
Makes for a great change from regular white flour rolls all the time. Thanks Chef! "
237123,169916,6/6/2006,5,"These turned out fantastic.  I have to say that I am not a great baker and things with yeast do not often turn out great for me.  But this worked and it was easy and tasty.  I am very impressed with these perfect little hamburger buns that I made.  Thank you for posting this recipe, I will make them again for sure!"
230102,169916,6/15/2006,5,"These were delightful!  Soft, slightly sweet and VERY EASY.  I used the new trans-fat free Crisco for the shortening.  Thank you for posting a wonderful recipe.  I think it will be our new favorite also!  "
121185,169916,6/22/2006,5,"These were great! They are light but still had a good ""chew"" to 'em, and were sturdy enough to hold up for a burger.  I did use the gluten and next time I'll sub 1/2 the flour for whole wheat - and instead of sugar I'm going to try honey.  These did cook up VERY fast - 8 mninuites in my oven and the tops were very brown - perhaps a lower temp to cook?"
29782,169916,7/31/2006,5,"WOW!! These were so GOOD!! They do have a slight sweet taste and very light texture. We love bread!, and this recipe is most certainly a keeper in my bread book! I did change one thing and that was..I used canola oil in place of the shortening. 
Thanks so very much for sharing this recipe. "
196985,169916,11/1/2006,5,These turned out perfectly! I love them! I didn't have to modify the recipe at all.  I ate a a few for breakfast with a little honey butter.  They were more like large yeast rolls and much much yummier than the store bought version! 
398075,169916,12/1/2006,5,"Great for sloppy joes and the like.  I changed and did 1 1/2 C whole wheat, 1 1/2 C all-purpose flour, changed shortening to 1/4 C Canola oil, and decreased sugar to 1/8 cup, no wheat gluten.  Fabulous tasting!!!"
217867,169916,1/2/2007,5,"We really enjoyed these!  I only cooked them for 8 minutes, and they were golden outside and fluffy inside.  Thanks for the quick and easy alternative to store-bought!"
83093,169916,2/15/2007,5,"This was my first try at hamburger buns and as I told my DH, ""They aren't the prettiest kids on the block but they're my kids"". In spite of their interesting shapes ( one looked like Australia ) they held the recipe #170488 like a champ!  I used canola oil for the shortening, 1/2 & 1/2 flours and no gluten.  Baked in my cranky convection oven at 350 for 7 minutes. Great texture and flavor! Will absolutely make these again and who knows what shapes they'll be?  A real dinner conversation item! ;-)  Thanks for sharing your recipe."
431543,169916,2/22/2007,5,This was a great recipe!  So easy to make.  I used Becel oil for the shortening and 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat.  For a lower calorie roll I also used Splenda sugar substitute.  This ones a keeper for sure.  Thanks so much!
333840,169916,2/22/2007,5,"I thought I had a good bun recipe before, I was wrong! But I do now! This is the perfect recipe! The dough is easy to work with and shape, and they come out with a beautiful texture.
I have made both hamburger and hot dog buns with them. Only changes I make are I use canola oil instead of shortening, I don't use the gluten, and I do 1 1/2 cups each of all-purpose and whole-wheat flours. They take exactly 8 minutes in my oven."
300880,169916,3/4/2007,5,"I've had a bread machine for awhile but have never used it for just making dough to bake in the oven.  I needed a roll for my lunch tomorrow and forgot to buy some at the supermarket, so I decided to look for a recipe.

There's a problem with the instructions or the nutrition info, though.  The recipe says to cut the dough into 8 pieces for hamburger buns, but the nutrition info is for 12 servings.  I thought 8 would make them too big and I did 10 instead, but I wish I had noticed the # of servings in the nutrition info first.  I know the recipe says it makes 12 hamburger buns so I guess it's based on that buy I think this would make 12 hamburger buns as well.  I didn't want them too big because I needed them to fit into my Mr. Bento lunch jar.  Luckily, I'm not too good at making things even and some of them are small enough to fit perfectly!

I used 2 Tbsp of Splenda Blend instead of 1/4 cup of sugar, and canola oil instead of shortening.  I ate one bun right out of the oven and it was so good - soft and tasty!  I kept an eye on them so they didn't get overdone."
397272,169916,3/21/2007,5,"I made these this afternoon to use for brisket sandwiches to go with DH favorite spiral cut fries...went exactly by the recipe (no gluten). I am WOW'd.  Held up fine under the sauce and tomato, great flavor.  No more store buns for us...Thanks so much for sharing!"
340847,169916,3/24/2007,5,Loved them!  I made hot dog buns that kinda looked funny since this is the first time I did it like this.  I will be using this recipe a BUNCH!  Thanks for an easy recipe!
136465,169916,4/24/2007,5,Made these for Sloppy Joes.  They were super easy to make and turned out great! They really put the bought hamburger buns to shame. Will be making these often.
332044,169916,4/25/2007,5,So delicious and moist! I used 2 cups  whole wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour. They turned out perfectly!
183872,169916,5/1/2007,4,"I am so glad to have found this recipe!  It is so easy and the rolls have a wonderful taste and texture. I got 12 perfect little veggie-burger sized buns, half of which I froze with excellent results. I was hoping they would be a little more whole-wheaty, so next time I may include the vital wheat gluten and increase the ratio of whole-wheat to all-purpose flour.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
456384,169916,5/13/2007,5,Simply wonderful!  I added a teaspoon of honey on top and it was divine!
254909,169916,5/15/2007,5,"I did half/half of the flours, subbed EVOO for the shortening, half the sugar, completely forgot the egg--and they still turned out fabulously!  Thanks SO much!"
122877,169916,5/21/2007,5,"I didn't use a bread machine, used 1/2 whole wheat 1/2 white flour, replaced the shortening with butter & used only 2 tbl sugar.  That being said these rolls are fantastic.  They went over very well with my entire family.
A new favorite!!"
81667,169916,6/11/2007,5,"I did make several changes, such as I did use half water-half milk, bread flour instead of all purpose, margarine instead of shortening, 2 teaspoons of yeast instead of 3, and I baked these at 350 degrees, as my oven is fickle!  The family really enjoyed them."
262200,169916,7/25/2007,5,"These were very good. I used Becel instead of shortening. Since there are only 3 of us at home, I decided to make half a batch - 5 teaspoons of egg substitute worked instead of an egg and I used 3/4 cup of each flour."
377712,169916,9/4/2007,5,"Thank you!  I was tired of buying overpriced (or extremely cheap) buns and knew there had to be better.  This is it!  I, too, used canola oil and 1/2 Whole Wheat 1/2 white flour and it was perfect!  I did use vital wheat gluten even though I am at 5500 feet altitude.  Boy did they rise!  My hot dog buns turned out too big so I cut them in half vertically, scooped out some of the middle and made two ""boats"" for the hot dogs.  My kids thought that was awesome."
329638,169916,9/5/2007,5,"Excellent- I cannot give this enough stars! The taste was amazing, the texture was fantastic. This is a definite keeper for sure- DH was amazed by these! Thanks for posting!
ETA: DH raved about these so much that I decided to try making it into a sandwich bread- I threw the risen dough into a greased loaf pan, let rise the 15 min, then baked at 375 for about 40 minutes- perfect!"
78643,169916,9/22/2007,5,"I've had to start using whole wheat flour more, so I was happy to find this recipe. I noticed so many of the reviewers were using 1/2 each of the flours,canola oil and using less yeast. I love these rolls. I make them smaller-making about 15 instead of 12. Works out better for me. My dh has never liked my bread machine bread but is liking these buns. Thanks for a great recipe.By the way, since there are only 2 of us I usually freeze half of them and they thaw very good and taste fresh."
69382,169916,12/1/2007,5,Excellent!  I did use olive oil instead of shortening and honey instead of sugar.  I also used all white whole wheat flour from Bob's Red Mill (love the stuff!).  Thanks!
210847,169916,1/14/2008,5,This is exactly what I was looking for to make some whole wheat buns. Light and fantastic taste. I will make this over and over. Thanks for posting.
206722,169916,1/21/2008,5,Great buns! Followed the ingredient list exactly.
324677,169916,3/15/2008,5,Best buns ever.  I too used 1 1/2 c. flour + 1 1/2 c. whole wheat flour.  I did not have the vital wheat gluten.  These were light and fluffy! I made them so we could have hambe=urgers tomorrow on the BBQ but couldn't resist grabbing one and spreading it with Cheez Whiz:)
164182,169916,3/16/2008,5,I use half and half whole wheat/white and I use half apple sauce in place of the oil... still terrific.
512309,169916,3/17/2008,5,"This made a very soft, delicious bun!  I will confess to changing a few things:  1 1/2 cups a-p flour, 1/2 cup wheat germ, and 1 cup whole wheat flour; canola oil instead of shortening; and honey instead of sugar.  That being said, I don't think I dramatically altered the outcome -- which was soft, slightly sweet, and delicious!  I made them slightly smaller and got 10 buns, because I have small children who couldn't eat a large bun.  I am saving this and putting it in my ""repeat"" file.  Thanks, Engineer!"
814978,169916,4/11/2008,5,"I have made this recipe at least six times, and we have LOVED the results each time! Instead of the flour listed in the recipe, I use some white whole wheat and some whole wheat (or stone-ground whole wheat -- whatever I have around -- just try to avoid using AP white). For each cup of whole-wheat flour, I add one tablespoon gluten. I've made these with olive oil or canola oil in place of the shortening, as well. Wonderful recipe!"
369698,169916,4/26/2008,5,"Made this without the vital wheat gluten and mistakenly cut into 12 hamburger buns - they still turned out perfectly.  These buns were DELICIOUS!  My whole family loved them!  Next time, I may add sesame seeds to the top."
509259,169916,5/1/2008,5,"I made this without the vital wheat gluten.The dough was very easy to work with with .  I made 12 perfect hot dog rolls. I will never buy rolls again, when you try this recipe you will understand why."
175100,169916,5/1/2008,5,"These buns are awesome and so incredibly easy to make. I followed other suggestions and used 1 1/2 c of apf and wwf and 1/4 c of olive oil, and they came out just perfectly. My kids had a blast rolling the dough and shaping it into buns. What I liked most about them is that they are very light, flaky and moist. The texture is wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe."
726534,169916,5/5/2008,3,"These had a nice taste and I was amazed how great the shape turned out, but they were too dense and bready for our tastes.  I followed the directions exactly and used all ingredients called for.  I think the problem was it calls for too much fat (which inhibits rising) and the rise time is too short.  Thank you for a great introduction to bun-making, but I think I'll keep looking for the perfect hamburger bun recipe."
192264,169916,5/7/2008,5,"Great buns! This is my first time to make hamburger buns, and they came out beautifully. I used all whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup olive oil, and 3 tablespoons vital wheat gluten. This was such an easy recipe. Thanks so much. Update:  I've made these each of the last 3 days. My family loves them! They would make great smaller dinner rolls!"
430663,169916,6/12/2008,5,"What an outstanding recipe!  These buns were so much better than store bought.  I, too, went with 1/2 flour and 1/2 wheat flour because I like a more pronounced wheat flavor.  These lasted several days and were still as fresh as the day they were baked.  We had ham and cheese sandwiches one night, and barbeque pulled pork another.

Thanks for a keeper that I will definately be making again and again!"
394077,169916,7/20/2008,5,"Exceptional.  I love these buns. I used 1 1/2 cup flour and 1 1/2 cup of whole wheat.   Baked them for 8 minutes.  So soft, tender and flavorful.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us.  The dough is so easy to handle too. Keeper!!"
182659,169916,8/3/2008,0,"These are awesome!  Not only do I now use this recipe for buns, but also for bread.  It makes a really huge loaf of bread, though, so if you decide to try it, be prepared!"
447165,169916,9/1/2008,5,"Couldn't be easier than this.  I agree with other reviewers, the dough was very easy to work with, and the rolls came out wonderfully.  Thanks!"
244064,169916,9/14/2008,5,What a simple recipe.  DH and I really enjoyed it.  I didn't add the gluten and it turned out fine.  A burger can't get any better with a homemade bun!
883260,169916,12/2/2008,5,Delicious!!!
1111408,169916,1/4/2009,5,"What a fabulous recipe. Fast, easy and delious!  A definate keeper.  I think these would be wonderful as ""breadbowls"" also."
1055648,169916,1/14/2009,5,I am never getting store bought buns ever again!! These were so yummy and easy to make.
165933,169916,1/18/2009,5,"I made these up the other day, put the tray by the woodheater to let them rise and it tipped off onto the floor.  I tossed the whole batch which did nothing for my mood!  yesterday I made it again and decided a loaf pan might be safer.  I baked two smaller loaves at 375 for 30 minutes and this was an awesome bread.  I loved the light airy texture.  My DH and his friend ate an entire loaf fresh out of the oven.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for a tasty recipe."
876090,169916,1/18/2009,5,"I made these for the wife and I tonight. She loved them. Very flavorable and light. Did have to add about 1/2 cup more flour to make it work easy. We put ""Hey Judes"" Sloppy joes #63689 on them and it was a perfect marriage. 
Thank you so much.

Firehouse cook."
353846,169916,1/27/2009,5,Made using bread machine yeast.  I let rise in an oven heated to 100 for 1/2 hour.  These are extremely soft and delicious
263673,169916,2/9/2009,5,"Unbelievable!! My husband has convinced himself that the health of whole wheat bread cancels out the most fattening of contents.  My regular whole wheat bread did not hold up to all fillings but these buns did.  They were easy to make, soft, fluffy, and actually add to a sandwich rather than just serving as a holder.  Had them with shredded chicken sandwiches and I will be making them again soon for burgers and dogs.  Thanks!"
160974,169916,4/14/2009,5,"Bread Machine Magic is a great cookbook! These buns worked out perfectly, too. I've made it with shortening and veg. oil and both ways are good. I bake mine on the lower third rack in oven and it takes about 12-14 min. on convection 400 degrees. Served them with chili tonight. Thanks Engineer, for posting.
Roxygirl"
495598,169916,5/3/2009,5,"Only one word to describe these: perfect! (also delicious, so maybe 2 words) I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  I can't wait to invite people over for burgers so I can impress with these buns!"
178427,169916,5/11/2009,5,Absolutely delightful!! I made the hot dog buns and they came out perfect. So much better than the store ones. Very easy to make. Directions and timing were right on. I'm putting this in my tried and true file and will definately make good use of this recipe. Can't wait to try the hamburger buns. Thanks for posting this.
25941,169916,6/20/2009,5,I made these yesterday and they were excellent.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks.
894403,169916,8/1/2009,5,"These are amazing! Made hamburger buns but they were good enough to eat as a roll, even my husband agreed.  Thanks"
986714,169916,8/17/2009,5,"These are the best!  This is the only bun recipe I use now, for anything, sub sandwiches (just make bigger than hot dog buns), sloppy joes, burgers, a side to a meal with just butter in them...everything!  My DH's eyes light up when he sees these.  Thank you so much for the recipe!"
403729,169916,8/28/2009,5,"Made last night to have with sloppy joe's, loved them.  I also used canola oil as another reviewer suggested, and they turned out great.  Made 8 large hamburger buns, I may try to get 10 or so next go around.  Thanks for posting!"
1133190,169916,10/6/2009,5,These are wonderful!  I used 3 TBS butter instead of shortening.  I might have to try to go half and half on the wheat and white flours next time.  These are great with Pulled Pork (Crock Pot)!!! Thanks!
1408837,169916,10/8/2009,5,Excellent recipe! I used 3 cups whole wheat flower and omitted the all purpose flower. They turn out perfect every time!
1405736,169916,12/4/2009,5,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed these before. I have made these as buns twice, a loaf of bread once, and rolls for Thanksgiving dinner. This the only yeast bread recipe in my cookbook. Thanx for the best roll/bread/bun recipe ever!
turbotess"
382322,169916,12/7/2009,5,"What an easy and useful recipe! I had to substitute butter for the shortening and added 1/2 teaspoon of yeast to compensate for the fat level. WONDERFUL results. I made 12 hamburger buns from the dough and what an easy dough to work with.

Making them again tonight, but trying EVOO and added a couple tblsp of honey for extra sweetness. 

THANK YOU!!! Add me to the ""Never Buying Buns Again"" list!!"
1433777,169916,5/8/2010,5,"Soft yet substantial, these buns are phenomenal!  Better than any recipe I've tried thus far, I think I've found 'the one'.  Tried these with turkey burgers today and my husband and I were delighted.  Unlike store-bought buns, these are thick enough that you don't feel like juices or dressings are going to leak through the bun and make it mushy.  So good, so easy.  Thanks!"
539686,169916,5/10/2010,5,"I love using a bread machine to simplify baking. I made these delicious buns as written except just before baking I brushed them with a beaten egg white (or egg beaters, which I always have in the fridge) and sprinkled on sesame seeds. Fantastic!"
648456,169916,5/19/2010,5,"This is the best roll recipe I have found yet!!!.  I use the white-wheat flour (king Arthur), the wheat  gluten and margarine for the shortening. They are never gummy, always very light & fluffy.  Excellent!"
808063,169916,8/16/2010,4,I needed to add quite a bit extra flour (maybe 1/4 - 1/2 cup) as the dough was very sticky. It is possible that this is due to the high humidity in  my area. Other than that the flavour and texture were quite good.
260176,169916,10/4/2010,5,These are excellent!  I now use this recipe to make dinner rolls too.
203916,169916,12/19/2010,5,Nice and big buns!  Held very sloppy joe very well.  Thanks!
1795791,169916,1/15/2011,5,"I was pleasantly surprised by the ease in making this recipe!  Canadian all purpose flour is milled quite hard and I didn't use the gluten included in the ingredients of this recipe.  It wasn't needed, as the buns rose nicely.  I used extra virgin olive oil which flavoured the rolls.  When the dough came out of the bread machine, no extra flour was needed and the texture was smooth and silky.  This will be a standby for us!"
1821624,169916,2/20/2011,5,We Love LOVED Them:) Thank you for the Recipe. I did  add 1 Table spoon of Flax Seed to it other than that I  followed the recipe step by step Thank you so Much :)
935285,169916,3/8/2011,5,Great recipe! I use half whole wheat and half white flour with butter and they're still perfect!  Will try some of the other variations that reviewers have mentioned.
1854363,169916,4/2/2011,0,These were deee-lish. First time I made Hamburger buns. It will not be the last time. Think about the price of Hamburger buns in the store? Will make these and freeze some. Thanks for the recipe. Think I will also add Flax Seed the next time I make these. Thanks Candeemg for the tip.
228638,169916,5/8/2011,5,Delicious!  I have made these several times and they always turn out SO good!!
1328641,169916,5/26/2011,5,This is a terrific bun recipe.  I have followed the recipe exactly and have had great results every time.  These buns freeze well and are nice to have on hand.  Thanks for sharing.
1928852,169916,6/10/2011,0,"I always BBQ larger burgers than the buns that are avaliable, It takes longer for buns to rise than original recipie, about 2 hours. I sprayed some water over buns for that extra crunch before i put baking sheet in oven after dough had risen in oven.I made the dough ball about 3 inches in diameter for a 6 inch diameter bun and yielded 8 nice buns. Everyone loved the wheat style bun. Easy recipie. Thank You"
1410978,169916,6/22/2011,5,I have been searching for a long time for a decent whole wheat hamburger bun to make at home.  Well my family just loved this recipe and my daughter who does not like wheat all that much has now requested I make this recipe for the BBQ birthday party.  Thanks for the recipe.
720970,169916,7/10/2011,5,"I used this bun recipe to make hot dog kolaches.  They turned out wonderful.  The buns were very soft and flavorful.  Please see the picture of my kolaches in the Photo section.  I made the dough in a stand mixer instead of a bread machine.  The directions for my variation are below.  Note that the recipe makes 8 very large buns or 12 regular sized buns.<br/><br/>Dry 8 jumbo hot dogs or 12 regular size hot dogs with a paper towel. I used turkey dogs to cut the fat.  Warm the water to 105 to 110 degrees F.  Add 1/4 cup of the warm water, 2 teaspoons of the sugar, and the yeast into the work bowl of the mixer.  Allow to sit a few minutes to proof.  Add the rest of the ingredients as in the original recipe and knead with a dough hook for 7 to 8 minutes.  I added 1/4 cup additional flour because the dough was too sticky.  Cover with a damp towel and allow to rise for about 45 minutes.  Cut the dough into 8 pieces if using jumbo dogs or 12 pieces if using regular size dogs, and flatten each piece into a rectange about the length of the hot dogs.  Roll the dough around the hot dog and pinch the seam well to close.  You can use the hot dog like a rolling pin :o).  Place kolache on a baking sheet seam side down.  Continue to make 8 or 12 kolaches.  Cover with a damp towel and allow to rise about 30 minutes.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes at 400 degrees F.  Enjoy!"
1122988,169916,1/29/2012,5,"Wow!  Airy, soft, and delicious.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour and added ingredients according to the bread machine's directions.  They rose up beautifully in such a short amount of time.  I made eight sub rolls to use for BBQ pulled pork sandwiches.  I'll be using this recipe over and over again for all sorts of applications.  Thanks!"
1292884,169916,5/18/2012,5,"Delicious and so easy.  I used less oil and a mixture of flours and added flax, also substituted splenda for part of the sugar. I added a bit more wheat gluten because I used more wheat flour and a bit of soy and the dough rose almost to the top of the pan, so more was probably not necessary!  I froze some of the dough - easier portion control.  Thank you for posting and for all the helpful comments."
2609730,169916,2/10/2013,0,"One word describes these buns, PHENOMENAL!!!!!  Made these last night and these are the best we ever had.  We will be making these a lot and not just as buns, we'd like to try them as bread and dinner rolls.  <br/><br/>My husband made them in his King Arthur Flour bun pans.  Those pans worked great and we got 11 buns out of the batch.<br/><br/>Store bought buns were the only ones my husband would eat, not anymore.  He said the store bought ones can't hold a candle to these.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!"
2841532,169916,5/28/2013,5,"Finally! I&#039;ve looked everywhere to get a soft, high raising whole wheat dough for hot dog and hamburger buns.  Tip: place the formed buns close enough together when you shape them that they raise and touch each other.  They bake up softer and you pull them apart.  Amazing &amp; rave reviews!"
2893563,169916,7/7/2013,5,"This recipe is amazing. I have been using it for over a year now with the following healthier alternatives; Use 3 cups of whole wheat flower &amp; omit the white flour; replace the 1/4 cup of sugar &amp; shortening for 1/4 cup each of honey &amp; olive oil. My picky children love it! We use it for cinnamon rolls, pizza dough &amp; dinner rolls!"
1801655445,169916,2/8/2014,0,Amazing. I incorporated the suggestion to omit white sugar &amp; shortening for honey and olive oil. simply delicious . I also used 2 cups of whole wheat + 1 cup of white.
2530018,169916,8/13/2014,5,"These were easy and delicious. I used 2 t sugar, and 2 T oil, and I ended up using only a package of yeast, and they still came out yummy. I did add the gluten as well. Thanks, I will definitely make these again."
2000052484,169916,3/9/2015,5,My hubby has been using this almost from the start!  Started out with bread machine and now do it when ever we need rolls!  We are requested to bring them at Christmas or any function!  The best !  Only change once in a while is 1 1/2 white flour and 1 1/2 whole wheat and always uses the vital gluten!  Thanks for the recipe!
277462,169916,3/14/2016,5,"Finally, a wheat bun that I like!  These were perfect.  They rose well and were light, fluffy, and tasty.  Easy to make and turned out exactly like I wanted.  This will be my go-to recipe from now on!  THANK YOU!"
2001032329,169916,5/30/2016,5,I made a couple of modifications to the recipe and this came out tasting fantastic and the texture is almost like all white flour! I used 2 cups King Arthur White Whole Wheat (which has the same nutritional values of regular whole wheat) and one cup of BREAD flour instead of the unbleached all purpose flour. To cut back a bit on the sugar I used 1/8 cup white sugar and 1/8 cup of Swerve sweetener (which is mostly erythritol and therefore non-glycemic). I also used the tablespoon of gluten which was optional. These rolls are INCREDIBLE!!!!
2000971998,169916,2/21/2018,5,
2000169775,169916,5/10/2018,5,Happy with the result using dough cycle w/ rise in my bread machine. I did cut the rise short as they were ready to go. Used the gluten as suggested and buttered the tops when they came out for a soft top.
133174,184551,12/4/2006,5,"This made a wonderful and filling brunch.  I think it would be equally good for a light dinner.  After cooking the potato until almost done, the asparagus was tossed in the pan.  Mixed the egg whites with egg substitute and remaining ingredients which were then poured over the potato mixture.  In place of the chopped onion, I used 3 green onions sliced.  I did the flip the frittata onto a plate and then slide it back into the pan instead of putting it in the oven.  As I said, this made a wonderful brunch."
424680,203418,2/27/2007,5,"Now let me tell you ~ this is an OUTSTANDING chicken recipe!! Yes, I took liberties with it, in that (1)I don't have a grill [believe it or not!]; (2)I cut back on the hot pepper sauce [though next time I'll use the indicated dosage!]; (3)I'm a chicken breast lover, so...; & (4)I made twice as much of the marinade/sauce as indicated [I like that kind of thing over brown rice]! Anyway, it all came together very nicely, with a combination of baking & broiling! Very tasty; very, very nice! Many thanks! I might be a day late in adding something that should have been included before, but it was brought to my attention that I didn't include my baking process ~ Well, I followed the recipe to the point of grilling, then baked the breasts for 35 minutes at 375 degrees F, before putting them under the broiler JUST LONG ENOUGH to brown them a little. They were served drenched with the extra sauce I'd made!"
199848,203418,3/26/2007,5,"We loved this chicken.  I marinated it for 8 hours, then I baked it (at 375*) in the sauce because I didn't want to lose any of that great sauce.  I added a pinch of ground cloves to the sauce, but no other changes were made.  I did, however, totally forget to garnish with the green onions..... great anyway.  I will make this again; in the oven and or on the grill.  Thanx!"
89831,203418,4/16/2007,5,"gosh this is a great chicken recipe, I marinated the chicken for 24 hours, and I increased the cayenne and garlic, I can see this sauce used for basting chicken while grilling and that is what I am going to do in the future! thanks for sharing Cheesehead!...Kitten:)"
444622,203418,6/11/2007,3,"DH grilled drumsticks that I had marinated overnight. He basted the chicken while grilling and I am sorry to say this didnt have the flavor that I was hoping for with all the five star reviews. There was more of a soy sauce asian flavor, the cherry and dijon flavors really did not come thru. I did not add the hot pepper sauce or green onions before serving. The chicken drumsticks were moist and tender and I will try this again baking it in the oven and basting so hopefully I will get the results the other reviewes did."
362919,203418,1/25/2008,5,"This was great. I was skeptical at first, but i recently had a great steak marinaide with grape jelly so i gave it a shot. The ONLY cherry preserves i could find was a 9.5 oz jar of bing cherry spreadable fruit - which made everything sorta a deep red/purple color. I didnt print out the recipe so i didnt even notice you were suppose to heat up the mixture first - didnt seem to hurt it any tho. I made some changes - i didnt have dijon mustard so i used 1 tbsp of spicy brown mustard plus 1 tbsp honey, and used 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce and regular soy sauce. I threw half in with the chicken to sit overnight in a plastic bag, turned it twice and the rest in a bowl to brush while cooking. When I cooked it i sorta followed Sydney Mikes advice, and threw it in a dish at 375 for 17 minutes and brushed with the sauce, then drained the dish, flipped and repeted. While that was cooking i heated up what i had saved so the preserves would melt (like i was suppose to in the first place lol), then transfered to a broil pan and gave each side a generous brush and 3 minutes under the broiler. Next time i will grab another jar of preserves, because the sauce is really good and i would have loved some more slathered on after cooking, but i dont like to use the extra from marinadeing for anything. This isnt as sweet as i was anticipateing, which is great, everyone loved it and i will make again."
311003,263589,8/13/2008,5,"This is a great recipe - especially good on a hot summer's evening as we had last night.  I made the shrimp mixture ahead of time and when it was time to eat I mixed in the sauce, and plated it with the butter lettuce right before serving.  The butter lettuce is a perfect choice -- mild with a sweet flavor.  When I made the sauce, I tasted it and it was so good I doubled the recipe and passed the extra at the table.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!"
199213,283034,2/22/2008,5,5 stars -Very tasty and colorful dish. Flavors worked well together.
63128,283034,2/22/2008,5,"5 Stars. Very flavorful and filling! This was a great breakfast that would also work well for a light dinner. It didn't take nearly as long as the recipe stated, partly because I microwaved the potatoes for 7 minutes instead of boiling them. It was ready in about 40 minutes. I loved the combination of ingredients and will definitely make this again."
233583,283034,2/22/2008,4,"RSC 11-  We liked these alot!  I  love potatoes, DH eats them sparingly (carb reduction) and he enjoyed these.  I followed directions to the letter minus the cayenne pepper as I do not eat hot.  Did have on table for Dh to add.  He liked the taters as is.  This is a simple recipe to make for a dinner or a lunch.  I can even see these as a breakfast potatoe/side.  Yeppers these are going into a keeper file.
Thank you for a new twist on taters."
65197,283034,2/23/2008,4,"I prepared this recipe with soft boiled eggs and served it for a Sunday Brunch!  Huge success!!
I added the extra cayenne as suggested!  Next time I think to cut down some fat...I'll skip the tbls of butter.
Good luck in the Contest!"
133174,283034,2/23/2008,5,"These made an excellent side for brunch.  As someone who is trying to add extra veggies to our diet, I loved the addition of the spinach.  The potatoes were white rose and worked quite well.  The recipe was divided by half and I had 3 nice servings.  For the reduced recipe, I did add the full amount of cayenne pepper.  Made for RSC #11--Good luck in the contest."
204024,283034,2/23/2008,4,"The RSC list of ingredients includes some strong flavors and colors, and this dish does a pretty good job of accenting and balancing several of the more exotic ones.  We had it for lunch; it could be breakfast alongside a couple of eggs. The men of the house gobbled it down while the ladies were indifferent.  If I do it again, I'll boil the potatoes less, since they have plenty of cooking time in the skillet.  Made and reviewed for RSC #11."
223854,283034,2/23/2008,5,"5 Star - WOW this was a really great side dish - Flavours really went well together and directions were really easy to follow, I used yellow potatoes because it was all I could find and I also left out the bacon because I don't eat it - Thank you RSC #11 Chef"
102058,283034,2/26/2008,4,Wonderfully easy to make! This is an excellent weekday meal when everyone is hungry and you are tired after work. The flavours came together well and it was well liked by everyone. Please see my rating system: 4 lovely stars for a comfort food recipe that I will be coming back to. Thanks!
131126,283034,2/27/2008,5,"We both enjoyed this as a side dish with grilled chicken. It was very colorful & reminded us of a good twist on okra, potatoes, & onions. I did squeeze the spinach very dry. We both thought the addition of garlic would be a plus. I left off the bacon.  Thank you for an excellent side dish from the RSC #11 ingredient list."
486725,283034,3/10/2008,5,"Wow! I made a light version of these (less oil and cheese, no butter, used low fat turkey bacon), and they were still absolutely fantastic! I added some garlic, used a chili pepper instead of the cayenne, and just a sprinkle of salt. It took only about 8 minutes for me for this to brown pretty well. The combination of flavors really works here, and the balance of veggies to potatoes is just right. We topped this with nonfat sour cream, which enhanced the flavor nicely, but it certainly does not need it. Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner!"
240552,283034,4/9/2008,5,"WOW! These were delicious!  I cut this down for just me and  made these a little lighter with less oil and turkey bacon. I also added in some red pepper and a garlic clove and sprinkled with some Italian blend cheese.  I will definitely be making these again soon.  Thanks, Kim!"
39301,283034,4/15/2008,5,Excellent Potatoes!  These were a huge success at dinner tonight.  I used yukon golds (just because I had some to use up) but otherwise followed exactly.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks for creating this gem!
88099,283034,4/19/2008,5,"What a great way to get those vegetables into your diet.  The flavors were just wonderful.  I left off the cheese because I didn't want the extra calories, but that would have just added to the recipe which I thought was fine without.  So glad I found this.  thanks Kim"
323186,283034,9/15/2008,5,"Very good, enjoyed and will make again.  great side-dish,  or could even be a main with other veggies on the side.     I've made this sort of dish before, everyone enjoys it, and we very much enjoyed this version!

thanks, Kim!"
679953,283034,10/3/2008,0,"These ar really, good. WE LOVED THEM !!!  The only adjustment I made was go 1/8 teaspoon salt.  Not one complaint with these. Excellent flavor, and excellent color. Made for Potluck tag."
92006,283034,10/20/2008,5,"Delicious recipe made with yellow potatoes, swiss chard and manchego cheese cause that's what I had in the fridge. My picky sons didn't eat ""the green stuff"" but ate the potatoes. My hubby isn't a fan of potatoes but he liked these. For Bevy Tag."
174096,283034,2/4/2009,5,Very yummy!  I omitted the salt and butter.  This was a great way to prepare potatoes that I am sure I will be using frequently.  Thanks for sharing!
489552,283034,5/20/2009,5,"Omg! I would give you 10 stars for this recipe.  My family loved loved it.  This recipe is hidden, it needs to be discovered.  An Amazing potato side.  I only regret that I didn't double the recipe, cuz we had no leftovers for lunch.  We topped the potatoes with 3 Cheese Ranch Salad dressing and it really made it even that much better.  Thank you for posting this recipe and I will make again soon.  I made for team ""Cooks With Dirty Faces"" for ZWT5"
386585,283034,5/21/2009,5,"Fantastic (and it does go great with eggs)!  I used red-skin potatoes, but steamed them in the microwave first to soften.  I will be making this often.  Thanks for posting.  Made for ZWT5."
1105991,283034,2/1/2011,5,"Great potatoes!  We loved them.  I also served them with eggs and it was a wonderful combination of flavors.  Thanks, Kim127."
77458,335889,12/31/2008,4,"This is very good and makes a lot! Next time I make it I may cut the recipe in half, but everyone did enjoy it. Thanks!"
4470,345877,12/7/2009,5,"Wonderful easy recipe packed with flavor - I love Old Bay spice and this combination of lemon, garlic & wine is so tasty - It adds to the flavor - it does not overpower the prawns.  I used Marsala wine in place of sherry6 Dec 09  Made again and enjoyed as much as last time"
1938147,346687,6/26/2011,5,Very unique flavor.  We loved this recipe.  My kids said they could eat it everyday ~lol~
133174,367983,11/6/2009,4,This does make a filling meatless dish that could be easily vegetarian by using vegetable broth in place of chicken.  I used a full can of green beans that had been drained and rinsed as that was what was on hand and preferred it topped with shredded cheese in place of the sour cream.  I will keep this recipe on stand-by to make again during the winter ahead.  Made for *My 3 Chefs*
379033,449640,1/13/2014,5,"* * * MADE FOR COOKATHON IN HONOR OF ZURIES DH JANUARY 2014 * * * &lt;br/&gt;This dish came together so quickly! We loved it! I used a Sambel Oelek for the chili garlic sauce. One I have used in the past, and it was just right. The sweetness of the peppers in this mellows out the heat for me. Which is perfect. I served it over jasmine rice which has a little sweetness to it also. My only alteration to the recipe was, I used only 2 good sized chicken breasts. We had enough for 2 of us tonight, and I have some for me and a friend to have for lunch tomorrow at work. Thank you Zurie for this wonderful dish."
895132,449640,1/15/2014,5,An great quick and easy recipe! I used my usual brand of sweet Thai chili sauce and served this with black sticky rice. Perfect dinner for us. Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for the Cook-A-Thon in honor of Zurie&#039;s DH.
305531,532629,8/2/2017,5,This was a hit at my house. Pretty easy and so good. It would be perfect with noodles to catch more of the sauce. Thanks for sharing Jackie. Made for CQ4.
29196,24554,4/14/2002,5,"Yooper, you said it all, these spuds truly are awesome, addictive and could be a meal on their own. We ate them tonight, and didn't alter a thing in the recipe. I'm seeking out great potato recipes, and these are way up at the top of my list. Thanks."
37036,24554,5/23/2003,5,"WOW!  Yopper, these were excellent!!!  I served them with my ""Sicilian Steak"" as you suggested in your review and they really complimented each other!  Serve along with a fresh salad, warm bread and red wine, and you have the perfect dinner to impress guests!  The only think I did differently is that I had to use dried rosemarry because I didn't have fresh.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing, and wouldn't!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!  I know I will be making it often!  "
15851,24554,8/5/2003,5,"Yooper, I think you are trying to make me fat!  These are quite possibly the best mashed potatoes that I have ever had. I used Yukon gold potatoes and dried rosemary.   I couldn't stop eating them, even after I was hurting!  I served them with Stephanie C's Herbed Turkey Breast and steamed carrots and it was like a gourmet Thanksgiving dinner in August!  I took the leftovers and HID them in the bottom of the fridge so noone would find them and eat them!  My dinner for tonight is already served!  Thanks so much for ANOTHER great recipe!"
121840,24554,10/3/2004,5," real gourmet treat!  I served these with #35023, the greek roasted chicken but they would be good with anything.  Very rich; a meal in their own right. Thanx for a new twist on mashed potatoes!!"
168218,24554,1/24/2005,5,"Wow! These were the absolutely delicious!!! Followed the recipe exactly except I riced the potatoes before adding the proscuitto mixture & milk and doubled the amount of proscuitto. Served it with grilled steak, but would probably be good with everything. Thanks for sharing!!!"
158086,24554,4/1/2005,5,this is a really good recipe...and very easy...i served it with paprika chicken in sour cream gravy and it was a wonderful dinner...you should try this recipe
83400,24554,6/25/2005,5,Delicious potatoes which we had with Veal Osso Buco #54107. The prosciutto is a great twist.
9869,24554,8/16/2005,5,"A delicious potato dish, love the added prosciutto.
A favourite for sure."
236383,24554,8/17/2005,4,"Like mewmew said, they would be good with anything. I replaced the prosciutto with streaky bacon but otherwise kept with the recipe. Only thing keeping me from awarding 5 stars is that I found the parmesan a little too much - but that is a personal thing. Easy to reduce to suit one's own taste."
110210,24554,10/8/2005,5,"What can I say about this that hasn't been said before? The leftovers are calling me from the fridge as I'm typing this. They we're/are very addicting and we WILL make them again. 
Thanks!! "
154146,24554,11/13/2005,4,"Very good. I cooked as directed and it came out great. All 5 people at the dinner party loved them as well, and took the left overs home. "
69248,24554,12/29/2005,5,These potatoes were amazing.Everyone loved them.  The flavour was excellent.  I highly recommend them.  Thanks so much for posting the recipe.
53932,24554,9/4/2006,5,These are very good.  I just added a sprig of rosemary to the butter and prosciutto and sauteed it briefly as I'm not real fond of rosemary.  That provided the barest hint of rosemary flavor.  Loved the prosciutto and parmesan.  
84038,24554,11/23/2006,5,I concur with all the other reviewers -- these potatoes are amazing!  I served them for Thanksgiving this year and they were a huge hit.  The prosciutto and rosemary isn't overpowering and the flavor is heavenly.
1168148,24554,7/20/2009,0,Delicous these are the best mashed potatoes ever made everything as stated and my whole family loved it!!Thanks yooper!!
2001797342,24554,11/15/2017,0,"I added finely chopped chives, sooooooooo good!"
22724,53594,2/10/2003,5,"There is really only one thing to say...WOW!  This recipe was just delicious!  I went with apricot preserves.  Very easy to put together.  I can't even begin to tell you how many different ways my family has thought to use this.  It's awesome as a snack or dessert all in itself...but we have thought it would be great on angle food cake, cheesecake, on ice cream, as a topping for fruit pizza, on pancakes and waffles...OH the possibilities are endless!!  This is just a great recipe and one that I will be making often!  I wonder if this would freeze well??  Thanks again for this great recipe :)"
53378,53594,2/17/2003,5,"I saw this recipe and knew right away that I just had to try it. Incredible!! The toasted cinnamon tortilla chips were delicate and crispy. That fruit filling was scrumptious and so easy to make. I had a hard time deciding what kind of preserves to use, and finally settled on plum. This is a great recipe with so many possibilites for experimentation. Thanks Sharon123"
23526,53594,3/26/2003,5,"Totally awesome recipe.  Made it for a dinner party and it was big hit with everybody.  I used Raspberry preserves and substituted the kiwis with watermelon.  The cinnamon chips were a perfect pair with the salsa, I'll made extras for next time.  I did dredge the tortillas through the cinnamon sugar instead of sprinkling and it went faster.  Definitely a keeper."
84219,53594,5/1/2003,5,"This was the best fruit salsa I've ever tasted!  The cinnamon chips were time consuming, but very easy and tasty."
42586,53594,6/11/2003,5,"Great recipe!  So easy to put together, different and impressive for summer parties!  I love the tip about dredging instead of sprinkling, even easier! Thanks "
71840,53594,6/16/2003,5,"This was so yummy! A bunch of my taste-testers and first thought: that looks weird, but then they all loved it. I used rasberry preserves and I loved the kick that the rasberries give. I thought it was pretty necessary. And the apples give a necessary kick. Other than that I think you could pretty much substitute lots of other fruits in here. Peaches or blueberries would be tasty. Oh and I used butter instead of spray and dredged the chips in sugar, but I think I would sprinkle next time because they were a little too coated. "
15851,53594,8/30/2003,5,"My BF is a chips and salsa fanatic but he is trying to cut back on eating it too much since it is a huge source of sodium.  I made this recipe for him. When I walked up to his desk with a little smile and said, ""honey, I made you some chips and salsa,"" he had to giggle.  He thought it was a really cute idea, then he tasted them.  is eyes got big and he said ""wow, this is really good!"" I used strawberry preserves and changed nothing. Thanks for posting this and making me look like an angel of a girlfriend!"
127403,53594,2/28/2004,5,I served this fruit salsa as a dessert to importants guests of my dad. It was alot of cutting but well worth it. My dads guests hope they can come back soon for more of my cooking. I think one of the important things about this recipe is it comes out looking so pretty and can be used for different things like other people said.
79737,53594,3/11/2004,5,"This one definately goes in the keeper file. Everyone who tried it really, really liked it. It is a lot of cutting. I added an extra kiwi fruit and used strawberry preserves but followed the recipe pretty much exactly. For the chips, I didn't have butter-flavored cooking spray, so I used melted butter, cut the tortillas in wedges using a pizza cutter and then dredged the triangles in the cinnamon-sugar. Once I placed them on the cooking sheet, I sprayed them with my cooking spray and they turned out great -- nice and crispy!!! For the cinnamon sugar, I measured out two cups of sugar and added cinnamon to taste. By dredging the tortilla triangles, I had A LOT of cinnamon sugar left over(which is fine with me, as I will just use it again the next time I make this!!!!) Thanks for a great recipe, Sharon123!!!!"
110135,53594,3/15/2004,5,"This was refreshing change of pace.  I used apricot preserves because I didn't want to overpower the fruit, but next time I just might try blackberry.  Yum!"
60288,53594,5/19/2004,5,VERY good!  I made this for a teacher appreciation luncheon at my daughter's school and it was a bit hit!  There were several requests for the recipe.  Absolutely a keeper!
58892,53594,6/20/2004,5,"This was a big hit at a recent party I held. I've also used it for a dessert social - a little lighter than the usual cheesecakes and pies!  I used strawberries, kiwi, and apples and mixed in a couple of tablespoons of no-sugar added raspberry jam. I used only 1 1/2 Tbs of white sugar( no brown) - just added it till it tasted sweet enough.  Thanks!"
135887,53594,7/6/2004,5,Very good!  I think next time I will leave out the preserves and the white sugar.  It was plenty sweet and would probably be better without them.  The cinnamon tortillas are perfect with it!
524379,53594,5/3/2008,5,"My wife made this as a snack for the group of elementary aged kids that come to our home after school everyday.  They gobbled it down.  Wonderful recipe.  She used my mothers homemade jam instead of the preserves.  I would agree with other comments though, with the homemade jam, we could have left out the sugar.  Otherwise a wonderful and delicious recipe."
122235,53594,7/11/2004,4,"We enjoyed this, but found it a bit too sweet to be an appetizer.  Definately a dessert, IMHO.  I found I needed less than half the cinnamon sugar mixture to treat the tortillas & they were plenty sweet.  I would also use less sugar on the fruit next time.  I used slightly different fruits, based on availability: pineapple, strawberry, grapes, blueberries, & cherries.  I added a bit of fresh mint & enjoyed that combination.  As another reviewer suggested, this would be a good topping for an angel food or pound cake.  Thanks. "
113117,53594,10/11/2004,5,This is a perfect appetizer for summertime.  It is very light and refreshing.  I only used one large apple.  This was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing.  
84867,53594,1/20/2007,4,"This became a huge hit at my workplace, I was hesitant because it was chocolate and it seemed different but EVERYONE loved it and soon I was being requested to make it...perfect summer time treat too!  It's easy to mix and match to your favorite fruits too!"
331946,53594,3/20/2007,5,These are great! I made them this weekend for my brothers birthday party and everybody loved them.
326084,53594,5/18/2007,5,"I have never had a fruit salsa before.  This was delicious!  You can even make the chips with wheat tortillas if you want and it still tastes good!  Of course, flour usually tastes yummier!  Will make again and again."
501659,53594,6/6/2007,5,I made this for a party for and it was great. I will usethis for every party I go to. Thank you!!
422893,53594,6/25/2007,5,"I made this for lunch & it was so yummy, especially love the jam glaze, I left out the raspberries but added some orange segments instead, scaled down to serve one with some nice vanilla yoghurt, this was divine. Yum Made for ZWT III."
65573,53594,6/26/2007,4,Yum! I love fruit salsas! I make a similar one but with blueberries instead of apples. The only thing I didn't like about the apples in this is that they got brown quickly--next time I would toss them with a citrus juice mixture to prevent that. I used blackberry preserves which complemented the other fruit nicely. Made for ZWT 3 Mexico.
193516,53594,6/27/2007,5,"This is truely an outstanding recipe.  I couldn't stop eating it!!  I used less sugar on the chips.  They tasted like those fried italian cookie things...mmmm!!  I used unsweetened frozen raspberries and strawberries, so my salsa had a fair amount of juice which I liked.  Thanks Sharon for such a delicious dessert."
236170,53594,8/31/2007,5,So delicious! I just made this and I'm waiting to make the chips until right before we eat it... but it's a good thing it makes so much because I can't stop eating it!!
565092,53594,9/25/2007,5,"YUM wow this is a great recipe, i added a small can of mandarin oranges and used sugar free strawberry preserves.  This was delicious, everyone was asking for the recipe!  I cheated and bought pre-made sugar/cinnamon baked pita chips from the organic section due to lack of time and it was still a hit!  Thank you so much!!!"
451301,53594,11/10/2007,5,"I love this stuff.  I added 1 large can of Pineapple ,crushed, and 2diced peaches.  This is the best stuff since Peanut butter and jelly!  For real! Thanks so much for posting this reacipe"
273406,53594,1/10/2008,5,"I make this quite a bit for my family and with my students.  The only changes I usually make are to leave out both types of sugar, it is usually sweet enough with just the preserves.  This is also luscious over ice cream, actually over just about anything!"
683007,53594,1/10/2008,5,Fantistic!  Make them anyway you want to!  Experiment with each recipe.  Dredging does save time.
464327,53594,1/19/2008,5,"Yum! Used frozen raspberries and strawberries, low sugar strawberry preserves, and just used store-bought Cinnamon Sun Chips. Thank you, we love this! Much healthier snacking!"
194611,53594,2/4/2008,5,"I first saw this recipe on the ""All-Recipe"" web-site. There are 1337 reviews, most are 5 star.  I was happy to find it here on zaar so i could keep it in my cook book.  I did make some changes, i hate cooking spray to i bushed the tortillas with melted butter then sprinkled the cinnamon sugar.  I baked these for 11 min.  30 sec.  and they were nice and crispy.  Will be nice on a hot summer day with fresh in season fruit."
452940,53594,3/21/2008,4,"Oh so easy this is to put together! We baked the tortillas while the fruit went in the fridge. The fruit salsa is a great way to use fruit, although we would lighten up on the sugar as it was a bit sweet. Also, next time we will do as some other reviewers and get store bought cinammon chips as ours were not so flavorful. Overall, a very nice snack to welcome the springtime season. It also makes a wonderful centerpiece at a cook-out."
747556,53594,3/30/2008,5,"Ok, this is amazing!! I recommend using pitas sliced into triangles and baked as the chips, these are thicker and a bit more crunchy --allowing more scooping action than the tortillas :) The women I served this to raved and raved."
396078,14367,12/16/2008,5,"If I could give you 10 stars for this recipe, I most certainly would!  This was the most fantastic, smooth, rich chocolatey French silk pie I've ever tasted.  Thank you so much for posting!  Yum!"
373495,53594,6/19/2008,5,"Yum!  I made this last night to go with a chicken salad.  I followed another reviewer's recommendation and used pita bread intead of tortillas (split them after cutting them up).  The were crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside...a perfect compliment to this salsa!  The store was out of raspberries (go figure), so I used blackberries.  Given the choice, I'd defintely go with the former!  Thanks for posting, I'm definitely making this again."
319943,53594,6/21/2008,5,This is my absolute favorite healthy snack.  I've made it twice now to rave reviews.  I admit I haven't tried making my own cinnamon chips.  I bought the bagged cinnamon pita chips which complement it perfectly.  Thank you for making my snacking healthier!!!
214988,53594,6/23/2008,0,"This is one of My Old All-time Favorite Pampered Chef recipes ""Apple-Berry Salsa""!  Though this one is just a tad different.  Always a hit & I make it whenever I really want to impress someone!"
658542,53594,7/3/2008,5,"You can't go wrong with this recipe! We used Pineapple preserves with the fruit mixture and it was WONDERFUL! The chips were great with it (and even by themselves, lol!) We will be sure to make this one over and over--great for summer! : )"
59163,53594,7/16/2008,5,"I made this for an appetizer at a bbq, rave reviews.  Everyone liked it and the cinnamon chips.  I followed the recipe exactly and would also probably not add the sugar the sweetness of the fruit is enough."
606608,53594,8/17/2008,5,This was fantastic. I made it while on vacation at the beach and it was the perfect light and refreshing snack after coming in from the sun.
400708,53594,9/2/2008,5,"Wonderful, Thanks Sharon for another great recipe.  I served this as one of three tapas at our Labor Day picnic and it got rave reviews.  The other two are recipe #228812 and recipe #147489.  All differant and all great.  I even forgot the white and brown sugar in this and it was still awesome.  Made it a day in advance so a real time saver and the flavors blended wonderful.  I used blueberries instead of rasberries as that's what was ripe in my garden and couldn't have been happier.  Thanks for posting."
442276,53594,9/9/2008,5,"marvelous! i usually cut the sugar in half, since the chips have sugar on them and the fruit is sweet itself. i used strawberries preserves and added peaches, too."
492434,53594,9/12/2008,5,"Simple and tasty!  This would make a great topping for ice cream, too."
789516,53594,9/21/2008,4,"I thought this was great!  However, my guests didn't touch it.  The salsa had a brownish look to it (from the brown sugar I'm guessing)  and I even added some lemon just to the apples to keep them from browning.  My guests definitely didn't know what they were missing because after they left my husband ate the whole thing.  I did find this to be a bit sweet for my taste, so next time I'll cut back on the sugar. The fruits and jam make it plenty sweet enough."
842778,53594,9/25/2008,5,This is so good. I left out the brown sugar and used about 3 Tbsp of Apple juice.  Everyone raved over this one. The homemade chips make it even better.
330545,53594,11/25/2008,5,"No kiwi in the house but everything else went in.  Carly and I pigged out, er, I mean we enjoyed this very much and will make fruit salsas a little more often now that we've tasted this first one. TFS Sharon."
126440,53594,12/17/2008,5,I used frozen fruit except for apple and kiwi.  Made as written except only two tortillas.  Had leftovers for breakfast and lunch for a couple days.
901317,53594,1/28/2009,5,This is one of my all time faves!
559283,53594,3/22/2009,5,I only used the apples and berries but this dish disappeared at my party last night. 3 of my friends insisted I had to pass the recipe onto them. I think that qualifies this one as a winner.
718620,53594,4/10/2009,5,"i only made the cinnamon chips - i had a lot of tortilla scraps from another recipe, so this used them up for me.  i used cinnamon-splenda blend and i can't believe it's not butter spray...so yummy - i ate 1/2 the batch straight out of the oven"
706176,53594,4/11/2009,5,"I am the ""fruit lady"". My inlaws only ever ask me to bring fruit to get-togethers (dating back to when I couldn't cook). So this time, I asked if I could bring something else and they again asked for fruit. Well, lucky me. After this dish, I don't think I'll ever be anythinb but the ""fruit lady"" (except now I don't mind!)This is super!!! A few things I do to keep the mess down: spray and sprinkle the whole tortilla on the baking sheet. Then I cut the tortilla up and then do the next coating of spray. I tried the ziploc thing, but it seems to be so messy! I will be making this again and again!"
492230,53594,5/18/2009,5,LOVED this dip! The kids were eating it by the bowl. I did not make the pita chips but served it with cinnamon graham crackers which was really good.
798244,14367,3/31/2009,5,VERY VERY yummy! Thanks for the great recipe!
1025741,236297,2/20/2010,5,Turned out really good!  It was a Mexican delight!
424680,53594,6/8/2009,5,"Made this over the weekend for a group I hosted, & they enjoyed this combo as much as they usually enjoy the peppery salsas & chips I usually put out! I even spooned some onto a bowl of hot oatmeal ~ ABSOLUTELY GREAT! Thanks for posting the recipe! [Tagged, made & reviewed in the FAMILY PICKS part of ZWT5]"
204024,53594,6/14/2009,5,"Absolutely beautiful, and delicious. I made this for an end of the year party for my 16DD.  We have sampled it but the kids haven't arrived for the party yet.  Made for ZWT5 for the Genies of Gourmet."
731059,53594,7/29/2009,5,"This recipe was a hit at my party, and I have already given the recipe to 2 others who loved it!"
1335425,53594,8/4/2009,5,"This won at my monthly snack club!

Tastes really good and the only thing I need to do is make the tortillas more scoop shaped to keep the salsa from falling off."
356638,53594,9/22/2009,5,"I've been wanting this recipe ever since my cousin brought this dish to a bbq. It was amazing, and I think I'll make it every other night from now on. :)"
140132,53594,10/13/2009,5,"Oh so good.  I made this a while back and forgot to review it, DD wanted it again and while I was searching for it realized I never added my review.  This recipe is so good.  I made just as written ands will followed your directions every time.  I will make more cinnamon chips this time  cuz we liked eating them plain too.  Thank you for sharing this with us."
249843,53594,12/14/2009,5,Great salsa!  I served this at a party I hosted and used boysenbery spread and it was wonderful!  Thanks!
786065,53594,1/27/2010,5,"This is absolutely scrumptious. I took it to a baby shower at work & all of the girls loved it! The grocery store I went to didn't have raspberries so I left them out.  I omitted the white sugar, cut back on the brown sugar & used apple jelly. After reading through the reviews on the best way to make the tortillas dredging or sprinkling I made them both ways.  Both of them were messy, neither were hard to do & they were well worth the mess of having to wipe up sugar.  I almost forgot to add that I mixed this up the night before work (I didn't want to dice fruit at 4:00 am in the morning!)  added a drop of lemon juice to the fruit before mixing in the rest.  It was perfectly fine the next morning."
768828,53594,2/19/2010,5,"I don't think I've ever reviewed this.  I haven't made the fruit salsa, but we love the cinnamon chips.  I use splenda and cinnamon mix on the chips.  Yummy.  Will make the salsa one of these days as it sounds really good also.  Thanks Sharon."
885594,53594,3/15/2010,5,"I have made this countless times now, but I keep forgetting to review it! Anytime I have a large group over for dinner, I am often asked to make this to go along with other desserts. It is such a tasty, healthier alternative. My DH especially loves the cinnamon chips - he likes to put frozen yogurt on them, and then add some fruit salsa. So delicious!!"
534554,53594,3/24/2010,5,THis was AWESOME!!  Doubled the recipe for a party and it was a favorite of everyone.  People were even putting it on their ice cream!  Great recipe!  I also cheated and used the cinnamon sugar pita chips to save on time!  Thanks for posting!
1607568,53594,4/30/2010,5,"Soooo good. I ended up using frozen raspberries and it just made it more ""salsa"" like."
475218,53594,5/25/2010,5,"I originally found this recipe on allrecipes.com.  I have made this for a few years now for all of my spring/summer parties.  I never add the sugars, the preserves or the raspberries, but always add some chopped up pineapple.  It has always been a hit.  I also don't really measure anymore but make batches that are double and sometime triple.  I make as many of the cinnamon chips as possible because the kids always seem to run off with handfuls and I need to have plenty on hand for the adults."
512461,53594,7/4/2010,5,"I made this for a July 4 picnic and everyone wanted the recipe.  I used orange marmalade for the preserves, and we all thought it added an nice flavor.  Next time I may drain off some of the juice.  Mine was pretty juicy, maybe because I used a pulsing food processor, but it made the prep easier . I served it with cinnamon pitas as suggested by a previous reviewer."
647495,53594,8/29/2010,5,"I made this for company.  They don't like things too sweet.  I used granny smith apples and added blue berries.  I used apricot preserves.  I didn't add any of the sugar, but it was a hit!"
494867,53594,8/31/2010,5,"Easy, delicious and I impressed the heck out of my friends when I went to their ""empty"" kitchen and came back not too many mintues later with this!"
407007,53594,7/24/2011,5,Amazing stuff! I left out the kiwi fruit but added in blueberries instead. I also left out the brown sugar and next time might use only a 1/2 tbsp of sugar. I enjoyed it with the pre-made cinnamon sugar pita chips (Stacy's brand). Loved it! Thank you so much for sharing!
461834,53594,10/4/2011,5,"Loved it!!!  I made this for breakfast for myself, so scaled back the recipe and used some different fruit than listed as this is what I had on hand.  I used a combination of strawberries, bananas, granny smith apple and orange sections and chose strawberry jam.  Thanks for sharing a great fun recipe.  Made for Stars Tag Game."
202268,50022,4/1/2005,5,"Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!! My 6 year old food critic gave it two  thumbs up!!  It was very moist and very easy to make.

"
23333,21196,12/17/2004,5,"Wonderful, easy and very tasty!  Thanks!"
2028532,53594,9/11/2013,5,"I made this for a afternoon snack for the kids, I wanted to be sure they get fresh fruit in their diet and it was a huge hit. I took the left overs to work with me and all the ladies asked for the recipe. I did not want to use too much sugar since the fresh fruit is sweet so instead of sugar I added pineapple tidbits with natural pineapple juice and no jam for the kids. The flour tortillas had enough sugar and cinnamon to sweeten it up even more. For my co workers I added 1  1/2 tsp of strawberry jam and it was enough for our mid afternoon sweet tooth craving. BTW couple of the guys asked for the recipe too :) Thanks for sharing !!!!"
210473,53594,2/13/2018,4,These need NO added sugar - there is enough sweetness in the fruit preserved. I served them in won ton cups coated with the cinnamon sugar. Great idea. (I added a dollop of lemon curd in the bottom of each won ton cup - just because I had some handy)
40533,60103,5/18/2003,4,"This was a nice simple dish that tasted really good, definitely filling. The only problem I had was the cooking time. I only made a half of this recipe and cooked it 45 minutes and the middle was still a bit cool. Other than that it was really good, thanks."
39835,93956,11/27/2006,4,"Very good dish with very little work which we served with (frozen) mixed vegetables. I think I cut my apples too thin because they disintegrated in the casserole and became more like applesauce but we still enjoyed this dish. We also only used 4 pork chops, 2 apples and 2 sweet potatoes but the amount specified for the apple cider and sugar. Next time if I only use 4 pork chops I will cut the apple cider down a bit more (maybe to 1/3 cup). Thanks for sharing!"
380547,93956,2/2/2007,2,"Like the previous review the apples fell aprt but still tasted good. The brown sugar sauce ended up on the bottom. I thought it would form a type of glaze over the meat but it didn't. I followed the directions except I used apple juice in place of cider. Having said that, the chops were okay. Just not worth all the effort and time it took to cook."
4439,104580,2/9/2005,4,"i made this to try for my son who loves pop tarts. I served this at a super bowl party and was really shocked, it was pretty good. no one at the party even guessed the mystery ingredient."
328542,104580,4/12/2013,2,"Was trying to use up some pop tarts which honestly I don&#039;t care for any way so this review is actually from my husband who said it tasted like a poor man&#039;s dessert.  He didn&#039;t like how the pop tarts were soggy and the overall texture was comparable to cafeteria food.  Sorry for the poor review, I&#039;m sure it would be a hit with pop-tart loving kiddos."
462571,170894,9/13/2007,4,"This pie was so quick and simple to put together and tastes great. The shortbread crust baked up nicely and the topping became golden and crisp with just a hint of sweetness. I could taste the egg, which may put off some. This is a good recipe to have on hand for a last minute dessert. I will try it with blueberry filling next time. Thanks for sharing!"
213909,170894,4/8/2008,4,"The tate was great, however I hardly had enough""crust"" to cover the bottom much less up the sides."
107583,195833,3/31/2007,5,"What a nice change from ""steamed"" broccoli!  We loved this.  The flavors are really nice.  Used about 1/8 cup of wine.  I used flowerettes instead of spears.  Thanks for posting this!"
340141,195833,4/19/2007,3,Very good.
496829,237162,1/27/2008,5,"Thanks J&R's Mom!

Excellent for the cholcate lover with unlimited possibilities.  I used a mixture of mini peanut butter cups, milk chcolate/caramel swirl chips, milk chocolate chips and white chocolagte chips.  For nuts, I used cashew halves.  This was a big hit.  It will be fun to experiment with other combinations."
131126,237162,4/28/2008,5,"These are very rich, but so good.  I cut them into sm squares rather than bars.  I will definitely be making these again for my holiday gift trays. Thank you for sharing the recipe.  Made for Spring '08 Pick A Chef."
415907,270956,2/24/2010,5,"Great base for crab bisque. I added some Old Bay seasoning, pepper, and green onions."
64539,294948,3/28/2009,4,Yum! I like the addition of paprika.
101823,325009,9/17/2008,4,"This is another super simple recipe that has a great comfort food appeal.  I omitted the green pepper and added onion with my browned ground beef.  I also traded out the water for tomato juice for simmering to increase flavor.  I increased the chili powder and garlic powder to taste, and added a generous shake of Montreal Steak seasoning.  I also added a can of rinsed and drained kidney beans with the ground beef just because I thought it sounded good.  We served this up with simple tossed salads, and had a great and easy weeknight meal."
197411,50022,4/10/2005,5,Wow!  This is delicious! My boys chomped this down in one weekend! Thanks for the great recipe. I think this is an absolute keeper!
422893,325009,7/2/2010,4,I loved the meat base of the pie but again I found that the jiffy mix was really hard to spread evenly on top and when it should have been cooked there were a few places where the jiffy mix was still a little gooey. Like Ms Bold I also added some kidney beans to the meat mix for a more chilli corn carne type dish. Thanks for posting!
465056,325009,7/22/2011,4,I think it would be much better with onion.  I had no problems spreading the mix like some of the other reviewers but I did not let it sit at all before pouring it over the top of the meat mixture.
437991,424050,6/5/2010,5,"I love salmon so i ate this all on my own. Thanks for sharing, ZWT6"
4439,472135,1/30/2012,4,"this was very good. i made it as posted, but the next time i will eliminate both the celery and carrots, use panko bread crumbs and cut the garlic in 1/2 and also eliminate the honey. but there will be a next time!!!"
59780,14367,4/17/2005,5,I made this right after Easter as a treat for DH who gave up chocolate for lent and he really appreciated it. I used No fail pie crust recipe#11062 for the crust and it was perfct. Thanks for posting :)
295995,14367,3/11/2006,5,Great recipe - made it for a high school class and they loved it - it set up very well and also traveled easily.  Thanks!
352814,14367,11/28/2006,5,"What a yummy, rich pie!  I made this for Thanksgiving dinner this year and topped it with some homemade whipped topping.  It turned out perfect!  Thanks!"
723470,14367,2/28/2008,0,One word = AMAZING!!
217867,14367,3/30/2008,5,"Outstanding!  Easy to make and delicious!  Everyone raved about this pie and couldn't believe I made it myself.  I used a store bought frozen pie crust and that was my husband's only complaint.  He said it was just too thick for the pie.  I'll try a homemade crust next time.  The filling is rich and chocolaty, not too sweet.  Thanks for sharing!"
716408,14367,5/21/2008,5,This was a big hit at my husband's place of work. The guys he shared it with said it was better than Baker's Square French Silk pie.
898105,14367,7/21/2008,5,This is a great recipe!!  I'm glad I picked this recipe to try out.
1048850,14367,11/27/2008,3,"This taste fine, it is good, the only reason i give it 3 instead of 5 is it doesn't taste like the old fashion french silk pie recipe i used to use.  I wanted to try the cooked egg version but the taste is so different.  Next time I might try making it with unsweetened chocolate instead of semisweet, maybe that is the difference?"
1011674,14367,11/28/2008,1,"This recipe did not work out for me at all. The chocolate, butter, sugar, cream, egg mixture never thickened. Even after going through all the steps, waiting 20 minutes with the mixture in ice water, and then beating it with my kitchen aid, nothing worked. I had to throw it out, send my husband to the store on Thanksgiving and make a different recipe that my mother-in-law gave me. I would not recommend this recipe."
432668,14367,12/1/2008,5,"This was the biggest hit at my Thanksgiving dinner! Wow. It did take more than 20 minutes for my mixture to thicken, but other than that, everything turned out wonderful. Like someone else said, the taste is not exactly what I remembered as ""french silk"" pie - it was almost more chocolaty than I wanted (is that possible?!). Next time I might experiment with a mix of more than one type of chocolate."
1826706,14367,2/12/2011,2,"Made this for my husband for Valentine's Day weekend.  Unfortunately my pie wasn't so silky after having been refrigerated.  I was looking for more of a mousse consistency and got a pretty hard, solid filling that I wasn't too thrilled about (the filling was beat until fluffy, as directed).  While it still tasted good it wasn't what I was hoping for.  I did swap the pie crust from a dough crust to a cookie crust and there were no complaints on that :).  Good luck with the recipe!"
2518106,14367,11/21/2012,0,I made this last year and it was wonderful. I am going to make it every year at Holidays. Not too sweet. All I can say is if you made it and it turned out wrong then maybe you should stick to frozen pies. It was the easiest pie to make! Yum. I used regular pie crust and one with oreo crust. Both were well liked. :)
1997669,14367,6/11/2013,5,"I&#039;ve made this recipe over and over again.  Each time it has gotten better and better.  I&#039;m posting again to share my new findings:  I found that the recipe turns out even better if you don&#039;t over cook your mixture before adding the eggs.  By not over cooking, you get a very silky texture."
2001321652,14367,12/25/2016,1,"Worst pie baked in the continental United States since I can recall. Tasked like skilly-winks, if you've had the disgrace of having known the flavor."
57256,50022,1/11/2003,5,"Delicious!!! This was Bon Appetite!! Everyone loved this moist and tasty bread.The addition of the choc. chips was a different twist for us but,very GOOD!!"
18344,50022,2/20/2003,5,Awesome! i just threw in the entire bag of chocolate chips. makes two loafs. thanks for a great treat.
86512,50022,7/13/2003,5,This is an EXCELLENT recipe. Delious banana bread. I made it at a friends house. She said her sons would not eat it if I put the chocolate chips in it so I omitted them I did as you suggested and made it into 2 loaves instead of one and you are right!! It was nice and moist. I wasn't sure how it would taste without cinnamon in it and it turned out really good. The taste of the banana really came though. I will definitely make it again and if I make it for myself I will add the chocolate chips. Thanks for a great recipe Tracy
114210,50022,11/28/2003,5,"De-lich! I tripled the recipe and handed out mini loaves as X-Mas gifts at work... where I am now very popular! Ah... but will it last into the new year? :)
Thanks!"
120715,50022,1/11/2004,5,"Very moist!! I put in little more butter than the recipe said.  Also, I didn't have any buttermilk at home so I used your alternative by sub. the vineger with milk.  It work out really well.  I made a loft very Sunday and have it for breakfast the rest of the week and I family love it!! Good Job!!"
30080,50022,1/19/2004,5,"This rocks!!!  Made four little baby loaves and it is just soooooo nummy!!!  First time I've ever made it, and this may be the last recipe I need for it :-)"
144147,50022,6/7/2004,5,"Very simple to whip together; extremely moist, somewhat dense texture that melts in your mouth. The buttermilk adds an extra note of depth.  This will become my standard for banana bread."
67270,50022,7/12/2004,5,Yum!  I made three smaller loaves for a bake sale.  Rave reviews all around.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!
57846,50022,8/11/2004,5,This bread is now my new banana bread recipe! We all loved it!! It\'s recipes like this one that make me feel proud when I\'m done baking! I added walnuts instead of chocolate chips just because I love walnuts in banana bread and I\'m not a big fan of chocolate chips. It was wonderful! Thanks for sharing this recipe with us!
128152,50022,8/15/2004,5,"Tracy, thank you for the awesome recipe! This was wonderful. It has been years since I have made banana bread so I really didn't have a good recipe. A special request was made for me to make banana bread. I found your recipe right away (along with quite a few others) and boy am I glad I chose yours! I doubled it without the slightest problem and made it in 3 large size loaf pans. I didn't have any buttermilk but I soured some half and half and that worked perfectly. I also used walnuts instead of chocolate chips. All I can say is I will be making this recipe time and time again. Thanks again. It will be a big hit when it is served.
Hugs,
Susie"
8688,50022,3/29/2005,5,"I'll add my 5 stars to this line up!  Delicious, moist and full of flavor! This banana bread will not disappoint.  I made this recipe eliminating the chocolate chips (per personal preference). I used 4 small bananas which worked very well. I made 1 loaf and one mini loaf.  The full-sized loaf was done in just under the time given in the recipe. Wonderful recipe which I will make again!  Thanks, Tracy for this delicious recipe!"
1535,50022,9/9/2004,5,"This is an excellent recipe. Even my not-a-big-fan-of-banana-bread husband had seconds! I used nuts instead of chocolate chips and made two loaves. Next time I'll check it before 60 minutes as it was a bit brown. I'll also make sure I grease and flour the pan as it stuck with just using spray. I want to make sure I try it sometime with real buttermilk instead of the soured milk. I'm sure real will make it even better. A keeper for sure! 
UPDATE: This time I made it with the chocolate chips & while they didn't take away from the bread, I'm not sure they really added to it either. I made one loaf this time and used real buttermilk, fantastic! Definitely deserves the title, The Best Banana Bread."
157877,50022,9/13/2004,5,wonderful...LOVED IT:)
73769,50022,9/28/2004,5,Very good moist banana bread. Used two medium sized loaf pans and used the vinegar milk substitute for the buttermilk. Thanks Tracy for an excellent recipe.
59679,50022,9/29/2004,5,THIS WAS A HIT at my department pot luck. I used light brown sugar. I put batter in 2 bread pans and only cooked for an hour as it appeared done. Perfect! Super moist and both loaves were gone within and hour of hitting our buffet!!!! Everyone raved over it! Will make it again and again. 
164786,50022,10/19/2004,5,FABULOUS recipe!! Super moist and such an awesome taste. Had recipe requests for this one. My husband wants me to make another for him to bring to the guys at work. I did make 2 loaves as suggested and they were great. The best banana bread I have ever made. Thank you!! 
125766,50022,10/20/2004,5,"I used regular chocolate chips because thats all I had on hand. I also had to make the sour milk, I wanted to use the over ripe banana's I had sitting here at home. It smelled so yummy. Came out perfect and the texture is really good. I tasted while it was still very warm. Very yummy and would make great gifts. Thank you for this yummy yummy recipe!"
65936,50022,10/28/2004,5,This deserves more stars!  Excellent!  My family loves it.  I make it with chocolate chips for my husband and two of my sons.  I then make some with walnuts for me and my 12 year old son.  Yum!
72730,50022,11/22/2004,0,"After reading 17 reviews I am surprised that no onee commented on the fact that step (3) directs you to ""...add eggs through salt"", and nowhere does this recipe tell you how, or when to add the flour/salt/ baking soda.  Experience directed me...and I don't have alot of it.  The loaves are baking now.  I will post with a advanced rookie's attempts."
135870,50022,1/20/2005,5,This bread is very tasty and moist too. This recipe is definitely a keeper.  My daughter (Chef Rachel Lynn) gave it a thumbs up. The next time I may try to cook it for a shorter time as my oven tends to make it a little too brown on top or maybe lower the temperature.  I cooked it in my Pampered Chef stoneware loaf pan.  I don't know if the type of pan has anything to do with how it cooks.
189566,50022,2/1/2005,5,"This recipe made the moistest most wonderful banana bread.  It made enough for two pans and I just adjusted the cooking time down.  Yummy, and highly recommended!"
169815,50022,2/12/2005,5,Thanks for posting a great banana bread recipe.  My husband usually finds something wrong with others I have made but hasn't been able to with this recipe.  I did not have buttermilk so I used 1 tsp cider vinegar with milk and it tasted fine.  I ended up with 1 loaf and 12 cupcake since I don't have 2 loaf pans!!  Yummy Thanks again
31611,50022,2/24/2005,5,"This is a wonderful banana bread! It is moist and has a very good banana flavor. It is easy to make and I followed the instructions except for adding the chocolate chips. My husband doesn't like chocolate, so added chopped pecans instead. I made it again (I had lots of really ripe bananas!) and this time I doubled the recipe and just for fun threw in a package of instant banana pudding mix. I added just a bit more buttermilk and baked it in a 9 x 13-inch pan. It was also great, had a bit more cakelike texture, but was everybit as good. Thanks for a great recipe, I will be making this one a lot.
Susan"
102299,50022,3/23/2005,5,"I made this thismorning while everyone was sleeping and about have way into it's baking, my husband got up, (about an hour earlier than he ever does)This is amazing because I usually can't get him out of bed for anything!!! Anyways this was amazingly moist, the perfect banana flavor and perfect texture. I did make a pan of six muffins and one loaf. The tops of the muffins burned but the loaf came out beautiful as you can see in the pictures. Sorry but I didn't add any chocolate chips because my family doesn't like them in our banana bread. Thank you Tracy!"
210169,50022,4/18/2005,5,"Made this delicious banana bread this past weekend and it turned out GREAT! I omitted the choc chips and added about a half cup of chopped walnuts instead. There was too much batter for one large size loaf pan, so made a couple of ""banana bread muffins"" with the extra batter. Baked the large loaf pan for 55 min, turned out perfect! Thanks for this great recipe!"
137302,50022,4/18/2005,4,"This bread was very tasty but too dry around the edges.  I think that baking it for an 1 1/4 hour must be too long...it actually looked slightly burned along some of the edges.  I will make it again, but will begin to start checking it for doneness at 45 minutes instead. Like several others I substituted nuts for the chocolate chips."
210406,50022,4/19/2005,5,"very Good!! super moist!
the kids loved it.
thanks for sharing."
31014,50022,4/28/2005,5,I am not a big fan of banana breads but I really liked this one thanks for the recipe 
146047,50022,5/3/2005,5,"Tracy H, I really love this banana bread. I baked it this afternoon and now have two beautiful loaves of moist delicious bread. I used just 1/2 c of fat (part butter, part shortening), plain yogurt and milk rather than buttermilk, and splenda for part of the sugar. Took an hour to bake (with two loaves in the oven). Beautiful color and texture, and I love the chocolate chips in this. Thanks for posting!"
89594,50022,7/20/2005,5,This is by far the best and last Banana bread recipe that I will ever use.  I used Land of Lakes soft butter with canola oil and the results were super moist.  Thanks for sharing.  : )  
168087,50022,8/6/2005,5,"These are fabulous!!By far the best one i baked, my family loved these.I reduce the sugar and butter to 1/2c (i have very ripe bananas) and they still turned out moist and just perfect banana flavor"
148715,50022,9/2/2005,5,This is the one!!!!  My daughter insists this is the only recipe I can make from now on.  Super moist and a great keeper.
185684,50022,9/10/2005,4,"Very good nana bread. I like peanut butter and banana bread sandwiches, and the chocolate chips were like a bonus,. "
55773,50022,11/8/2005,5,Easy...Good flavor...Keeper...
259367,50022,2/13/2006,5,"Delicious!  This was the first time I've had chocolate chips in my banana bread, and they added a great flavor.  I only had two bananas; other than that I followed the recipe exactly, making two loaves, and it turned out very moist with a perfectly browned crust."
254446,50022,9/25/2006,5,"Awesome Bread! My kids who won't eat Banana Bread ate this up. I did omit the chocolate chips, just a personal preference. Love the recipe, and it will replace my old recipe. This bread is so moist and delicious! Yummy! Thanks for the great recipe!
"
185142,50022,11/16/2006,5,I only used 1 cup of sugar because I don't like my banana bread too sweet. It was THE BEST banana bread I have ever had - moist and full of flavor. I think the key is the blackened bananas. Hat's off to you Tracy H.
252316,50022,1/21/2007,5,This is really good bread and I will use it from now on.  I used 3/4 cup sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar (1 1/2 cups sugar was too much for me) and I didn't have any buttermilk and instead of milk and vinegar I used 3/4 cup applesauce.  I did not use the chocolate chips.  I baked in mini loafs for 45 minutes.  Very yummy!!
173579,50022,1/30/2007,5,"This is a very good banana bread.  So moist, it just melts in your mouth.  Also loved the mini chips in it.  Thanks for posting."
386849,50022,1/30/2007,5,really liked this- thanks for posting!
74342,50022,2/7/2007,4,Very good banana bread.  I used toffee chips instead of the chocolate chips and baked the bread in mini loaf pans.
295705,50022,3/10/2007,5,Wow! Thanks for an amazing banana bread recipe!  It's so great - my family loves it!
309751,50022,3/13/2007,5,"This is the fluffiest banana bread I have ever made. I added chopped pecans, and trippled it (I had a ton of bananas from a food co-op) and we still ate all 6 loaves in about a week. Thanks so much! The whole family loved it! We are making another 6-8 loaves today! We also did not use chocolate chips (we have enough chocolate in our diets already, I assure you).  This is AWESOME sliced and toasted."
141688,50022,3/17/2007,5,"I made muffins using this recipe and enjoyed them very much. I had three large bananas that were definitely black and ready for bread-making. I cut back to 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup sugar, and used half unbleached flour and half whole wheat flour. I had to use sour milk because I didn't have any buttermilk on hand - I look forward to making this again with buttermilk. I did not use chocolate chips, I added chopped walnuts to mine. The result was an excellent moist and soft muffin with nice banana flavor that goes very well with my coffee addiction. :)"
189579,50022,5/22/2007,5,"Ok , it took me some time to decide, but now I'm sure this is the best banana bread recipe on this site!
Thanks a lot Tracy.
And just one thing - 45 min. is enough time to bake this one. Then let it rest for 10 minutes before eating."
341474,50022,5/23/2007,5,"Awesome! I just moved this to my ""Love It"" cookbook. This is the best banana bread recipe I've every tried! I did substitute chopped walnuts for the chocolate chips. 2 loaves took about 45 minutes. The prep was really easy, thanks for all the tips!"
134011,82226,10/21/2005,5,Yummy...this is better than chocolate milk.
197244,50022,5/27/2007,5,"Very good Banana Bread, I think the best I've tried making. I put Chocolate Chips and Walnuts in one loaf and left the other plain, and I think I like the plain one better, much better flavor. *Just made this again, doubled the batch and added just 2 1/2 cups sugar and package of instant vanilla pudding, very moist and sooo delicious * Very Yummy - Thanks."
290578,50022,6/7/2007,5,"This has got to be the very best banana bread I have ever had!  I got sooo many compliments on how moist and wonderfully full of banana this bread was.  I'm a purist, so I omitted the mini chocolate chips, and it tasted great!!!  Come to think of it, it tastes like the banana bread at my local Starbucks-  yummo!  thanks for a keeper, I'll definitely be making this one again!"
169166,50022,6/10/2007,5,"I tried this recipe a few years ago and never did rate it. I made it first for my nursing class tutorial group and ended up giving the recipe to everyone, and none of them baked or cooked often. Now, my one classmate tells me that this is the one recipe her family uses to make banana bread EVERYTIME. I agree, it's simply the best!"
195106,50022,6/13/2007,5,Delicious!
205756,50022,6/15/2007,5,"This is a GREAT recipe! I made this recipe as is for the first batch and on the second batch I took some liberties. I added a cup of pecans, and about a cup of strawberry puree, since I had strawberries to use, and a nice handful of coconut. Both batches were GREAT! Very moist and yummy! Thanks for a wonderful recipe! I will be using it many times."
365429,50022,6/22/2007,3,"With 54 other ratings, what else can be said!?! I rated it 3 stars because while it was good enough to eat, it just didn't have a lot of banana flavor. However - I DID NOT add the chocolate chips (because I didn't have any), so this may have been the missing piece that really made the bread ""The Best"" as the recipe title states!  I love the addition of buttermilk, which kept the bread really moist.****UPDATE*** The flavor and texture of this bread improved after sitting for a day. I would definately make it again."
520150,50022,7/5/2007,5,This was just wonderful.  I have made this several times for my Saturday morning group of friends.  I have made it both with & without the chocolate chips.  And once I used 2 bananas & some strawberries.  Moist & delicious.  Thank you very much for the wonderful recipe. :)
113894,50022,9/2/2007,5,"Made this for a bake sale...and it sold out very quickly!  Then, I got calls asking me for the recipe.  Thanks, Tracy"
64683,50022,9/19/2007,5,"Very easy to make.  I ended up mashing everything in one bowl, so clean-up was great.  Bread came out super moist.  Next time, I will use 1/2 cup sugar as we found it a trifle too sweet."
68692,50022,11/2/2007,5,Another 5 stars for this delicious moist banana bread. I cut the sugar back to 1 cup per some suggestions and used chopped pecans as that's what my Grandmother always used and I was in need of some nastalgia. This made one nice loaf in my Pampered Chef clay bread pan. I set the heat back to 325 and checked the bread more often since this pan seems to bake faster. It took about 50 minutes to bake. I suspect I'll be hiding bananas now just to have over ripe ones to make this wonderful bread often. Thanks for sharing Tracy and thanks to all the others that sent comments.
632249,50022,11/29/2007,5,"Your recipe is very close to one I do from a Mennonite cookbook.  I thought my recipe was good but my son thinks yours might be just a bit better...can you believe that? 
I did include the chocolate chips for the kids. Thx."
523888,50022,11/29/2007,5,"AWESOME!  Tracy H., you're right, this is the LAST recipe I will need for banana bread!!!  Outstanding.  I added 1/2 c pecans, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Really great.  Thanks so much for sharing!"
592131,50022,12/5/2007,5,"Okay...this is the most incredible banana bread I've ever had...Do I have to share?
I replaced the chocolate chips (I'm not a fan) with chopped walnuts and it's just incredible. Great recipe!"
552613,50022,12/21/2007,4,This was a very good banana bread.  I used finely chopped walnuts instead of the chocolate chips because I was using this as part of my Christmas cookie trays and I already had a ton of chocolate items.  It turned out really moist.  I got two loafs out of the batch.
55994,50022,1/1/2008,5,Awesome!!! Doesn't last long in our house!
394077,50022,1/16/2008,5,Followed the recipe exactly and they came out moist and very nice flavor.  I baked them as muffins at 350 for 30 minutes
720912,50022,1/16/2008,5,i used milk instead of buttermilk ( and i was also out of vinegar) and this came out wonderful. I used a fancy williams/sonoma loaf pan and the recipe was perfect for one fancy loaf-thanks for this great recipe
32058,50022,1/22/2008,5,"Da best!  I love banana bread and this recipe is tops in my book!  Would double next time as this didn't last 12 hours in our house.  I made it in 3 mini loaves and omitted choc chips as a personal/family pref.  For buttermilk I used skim milk with 1/2 teaspoon vinegar.  Excellent results, super moist! TY for posting!"
395355,50022,1/26/2008,5,"I made two loaves, as suggested in the directions,(I did leave out the chocolate chips) and my whole family loved it.  The baking time ended up being only about 45 minutes making the two loaves.  

I made it to take to church so I had to rush one loaf to the freezer so it didn't disappear before Sunday.  I will definately make this again. Thanks!"
722236,50022,1/27/2008,4,I made two loaves with this and my oven is off temp wise so it didn't take as long to bake.  Taste was good but for personal preference I will add some spice next time.
232532,50022,1/30/2008,5,"No stars because, in the directions it states to pour into greased loaf pan. WeLL, I sure wish you would have said 2 loaf pans. This stuff has poured all over my oven, repeatedly. The house has an aroma but it ain't good. The stuff that fell into the pan I placed under the loaf pan sure taste great, but the mess has me very aggrivated. Just commit to the 2 loaf pans, and pluralize it in the directions, see I usually quit reading once it tells me the length of time. I'll rate it once it's done and the house airs out.
Follow-up: This bread was fabulous, but please be sure you use two loaf pans and adjust baking time as needed."
284091,50022,2/3/2008,5,Loved it and so did the family. This one's a keeper. Thank you so much. I think my quest has ended!
264745,50022,2/10/2008,4,"I'm always on the hunt for MOIST, but not gooey, banana bread, one of my spouse's favorite foods. This one is a keeper! My three black bananas were small, so I added one cup of pear butter cuz it's what I had on hand, and left out the chocolate chips. I also used two 9 x 5 loaf pans in my convection oven at 325 degrees. Loaved were perfectly browned and done in 45 minutes (when a toothpick came out ALMOST completely clean). I've thought of other additions I think would be good....applesauce or apple butter, pumpkin butter, etc. Thanks for a really good recipe!"
187987,50022,2/10/2008,4,"You cant go wrong with buttermilk!I love baking with it.I used bananas from my backyard.I was ran out of white sugar,used half a cup brown sugar,came out great.Thanks Tracy H"
774665,50022,3/6/2008,5,Really good flavor! I made one large loaf and then used the rest of the batter to make mini muffins and they were a huge hit with my kids. Too easy to pop in the mouth and then before you know it they're gone! I'll come back for this one!
35106,50022,3/21/2008,3,"Turned out moist, but a huge chunk of it was unbaked in the middle. Probably better to convert it to muffins next time."
805689,50022,4/4/2008,5,"Perfect recipe.  Proportions are spot on!!!  I used mini-mini loaf pans (4""x2""x2"") and one recipe made 8 perfect sized loaves.  I am using them as favors for a ""monkey-themed"" baby shower.  I will forever use this recipe.  I omitted the chocolate chips...next time I may try adding a little shredded pineapple to the recipe."
531155,50022,5/14/2008,5,"Stupendous!! Truly the BEST banana bread I have ever made! Wonderfully moist and full of flavor! The only things I did different were: I used half white sugar, half brown sugar per a reviewer's suggestion; also I used 3 blackened bananas and a well-spotted banana. It turned out so well, I am going to always make sure I buy too many bananas! :)
Forgot to mention that DS went crazy over it and had 2 slices by himself! (He has always hated the other loaves I made.)"
62819,50022,5/24/2008,0,"I have tried many banana bread recipes over the years.  This is simply the most incredibly moist, and flavorful I've ever tried... even if it manages to still be around a week later - it happened once, I'm not sure how!  My friends rave: makes a great addendum to any gift package."
320096,50022,5/26/2008,0,"This has become my go to banana bread recipe...and make it as often as I can, although, living with a bunch of monkeys it hard to find over-ripe bananas in our house.  This is a great recipe as it is but I have made it several times, and no one has noticed when I've done the usual ""healthier"" substitutes.  I normally use margarine squares and hate to split one so I use 1/2c. marg and 1/3c. of applesauce.  I cut the sugar to 1c., use 1c. white flour 1c. whole wheat and use light buttermilk.  Thanks for a great recipe and the extra tips!"
399657,50022,6/15/2008,5,"Well, Tracy, let's just say between three people we went through one loaf and eight mini loaves in three days.  Addictive!  This was extremely moist, almost to the point that I thought I may have used too much butter, so I think I may cut back a tad next time or sub some applesauce like others.  Really good stuff!  It took 40 min. for the mini loaves and 60 min. for the regular loaf.  I've tossed my old banana bread recipe that has the most reviews on this site because this surpasses it by far.  Thanks!"
862436,50022,6/15/2008,5,"I absolutely love this recipe and use it all the time. In my opinion, there is no better way to use up blackened bananas than to make banana bread. I leave out the chocolate chips due to personal preference, but I love the rich flavor imparted by using butter instead of oil. I divide this into two loves and bake for 40 minutes - perfect every time!"
218535,50022,6/18/2008,3,Recipe #9351 is way better. This is only OK.
196470,50022,8/23/2008,5,"This is my FAVORITE banana bread recipe!!  We have made it so many times....sorry I didn't rate it sooner!!  My son's favorite snack is THIS banana bread!!  I was looking for a banana bread/cake recipe I could make in a bundt pan...and he said, Scroll down....and he found this recipe....and said, ""This is our banana bread!!""  Thank you for such a great recipe!  **I use regular chocolate chips and milk & lemon juice or vinegar**  EDITED TO ADD:  I recently started making my own butter (just whip Heavy whipping cream until the buttermilk separates and the butter is stuck to the bowl / beaters....pour off the buttermilk and use for the bread!  YUM!"
807161,50022,9/5/2008,5,"I made this bread last night for a back to school treat for my daughter, and she loved it!.   I made two loaves and they were so moist.  I did cut back to only 1 cup of sugar and it did not compromise the taste one bit.  I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon.  Great recipe!!!!! A keeper for sure, thanks for posting."
117221,50022,9/6/2008,5,Amazing!  Great recipe..I used chopped pecans instead of chocolate chips.  I made 12 muffins and a small loaf of banana bread.  They turned out really nice...I baked them 40 minutes and probably could have shortened it to 30 as they were pretty brown.  Thanks for a great recipe!
877111,50022,9/19/2008,5,"Fantastic banana bread recipe. Moist and delicious. My BF was thrilled that I finally made him banana bread. I chose to omit the chocolate chips, just because I was lazy and didn't want to run to the store. I also think next time I make it I will shorten cooking time by about 4 or 5 mins. Most likely my oven though. My 10 year old, foodie in Training, Daughter helped make this, and said she loved making it cause it was easy to do and smelled fantastic while baking. All in all a great recipe. Thanks Tracy H."
461801,50022,9/26/2008,5,"This banana bread is wonderful...I have tried many, lots of them on this site including my own moms - this one is my favorite! (sorry Mom) The 'YUM-factor' is incredible...I love banana bread! I have four kids and everyone gets excited when they smell the aroma from this bread baking. I use the mini choc. chips like Tracy suggests - they add a nice touch with or w/o nuts. I also try to use bread flour and this bread comes out very light, moist and fluffy.  Thank you Tracy!"
260911,50022,9/30/2008,5,"I shared this with the girls at work and they really liked it.  Very good texture.  I made one minor change to the recipe and added a handful of crushed bran cereal.  Then, baked in two mini loaf pans."
590656,50022,10/2/2008,5,"I made this last  evening with good results.  My bananas were BLACK!  Since I like more banana flavor in the future I will add a fourth banana.  Even though I used egg whites, subbed 1/2 cup of Spenda for sugar, and added 1/4 tsp. of baking powder (to compensate for the Splenda) this bread was just right in consistency!  I'm giving this one 5 stars!  Next time I might add some choc. mini chips!"
853146,50022,10/17/2008,5,"OUTSTANDING!  This is, by far, the best banana bread I have ever made.  *Everyone* was hovering in the kitchen last night, waiting for the breads to be finished, and they were well worth the wait! Moist, dense witout being heavy, and this is the first banana bread I've made that no one cut the edges off of!  They were golden, crispy and delectable.  I used 1 tsp banana extract as well as the vanilla, and exchanged 1/2 cup of white sugar for brown sugar.  The banana flavor was just fantastic!  No more dark, heavy, soggy banana bread for us.  5 stars and a HUGE thank you!"
1015778,50022,11/6/2008,5,"Absolutely the BEST! I made this recipe but made Texas Muffins instead of a loaf so it was like eating a little mini cake! Oh my, I had to give them away or I would have eaten them ALL! Also, I used chunky chocolate pieces instead of the mini chips-it was all I had at home...it really made them look like I worked at a world class bakery!
Excellent recipe!"
167046,50022,12/14/2008,3,"Not the best, not the worst. Flavorful, but come out very mooshy, dense, & greasy. I prefer a firmer, sliceable texture.  I followed the recipe exactly and made it twice. You could see the grease bubbles boiling in the pan as it cooked. The bottoms came out dark & fried-tasting. The bottom of the mini-pan had a visible layer of oil when I flipped it out of the pan. The batch with chocolate chips definitely tasted better than the batch without. One batch made a loaf pan's worth - the other batch yielded a mini-loaf plus 12 muffins baked in nutcups."
39261,50022,12/24/2008,5,"LOL well, I don't get the 3 star rating and how it could of turned out so horribly wrong, I have made this recipe time and time again with excellent results, even handing the recipe out to those who have raved over it..EXCELLENT Bread.."
462421,50022,2/1/2009,5,"When I saw the 3 star rating I just had to put in my two cents. This is a *6* STAR RECIPE - the only way to really mess it up is to add the wrong measurement or the wrong ingredient; say adding 3/4 of a POUND of butter (instead of 3/4 CUP) would definitely do it.  I make mine with walnuts (no chips) & add 1/2 teaspoon of Wagner's Banana Extract.  Just made another loaf - this is a very forgiving recipe as far as ingredients go, so just make sure your baking soda is fresh, & you'll have a delicious bread!"
684358,50022,2/1/2009,5,"This is the best  banana bread recipe! I have made it twice now, once in a bundt pan and also as a set of muffins. Both were awesome, so moist and delicious. I added a little coconut in the mix with some choppped walnuts instead of the chocolate chips. These are fabulous really...YUMMO"
170691,50022,2/7/2009,5,It truly is the best banana bread!  Wonderful recipe with or without the chocolate chips.  I highly recommend it!  Very Moist.
1231048,50022,4/8/2009,5,"INCREDIBLE! Deliciously moist, wonderful banana flavor. I brought some for my boyfriend's family, and now they absolutely adore me! I cut back on the butter and added 1/4 cup of sour cream, and then topped with cinnamon streusel halfway through the baking process. With the extra batter I also made 6 additional banana bread muffins. In the future, I would recommend lowering the temperature and extending the baking time, but all in all, scrumptious banana bread that will disappear in no time!"
373495,50022,5/27/2009,5,"YUM.  So moist, excellent flavor.  I may just toss my other banana bread recipe.  I love how sweet the crust is.  I did the buttermilk trick (lemon juice and lowfat milk), and added pecans instead of chocolate chips; I just like that flavor more.  I did make 3 mini loaves, but they were done in about 45 minutes.  This banana bread is wonderful.  Thank you, Tracy!"
198750,50022,6/2/2009,5,amazing! I cooked 2 loafs for 1 hour and they were perfect! I have been looking for a recipe that was similiar to one I used to have but lost and this matches it perfectly! I didnt add chocolate or nuts because I like it plain. THANKS!
644191,50022,6/7/2009,5,"Amazing!  Light, moist and served slightly warm with butter... yumm!"
481092,50022,7/13/2009,4,"This was good, however, compared to the other reviewers I was a little disappointed.  Mine seemed quite dry.  It was light, but just needed a little more moisture to me.  Batter was awesome :)."
537832,50022,9/10/2009,5,"fantastic! I followed the suggestion of baking it in two loaf pans and it worked perfectly. i did everything by hand, the cleanup was a breeze and I had the loaves in the oven in just a couple minutes. So far one whole loaf has just ""vanished"" mysteriously so I assure you my son and husband love it. the taste I got was super satisfying, I know the second loaf won't last long either. time to go get more bananas ...too bad it takes so long for them to blacken!"
647466,50022,9/15/2009,5,The choclolate chips add just the right touch.  Delicious!
437587,50022,9/20/2009,5,"This was wonderful! It was so moist and full of flavor, my search for the perfect Banana Bread is over! I have tried useing both chopped walnuts and chocolate chips and both are great. Thanks for posting!"
1461219,50022,11/24/2009,5,"This is a wonderful recipe! My family will love this on Thanksgiving.
I did a couple of things different because of an old recipe of my mom's. I added 4 huge bananas and used evaporated milk with a tablespoon of vinegar to sour. The bread turned out to a beautiful cracked finish, like my mom's. The vinegar and soda makes the bread rise more and reduces the gas from the bread. Just an old trick. Totally awesome recipe!"
869696,50022,12/8/2009,5,"This is a delicious banana bread recipe.  I think I will make two loaves as suggested next time, because one loaf browns too much way before the centre is cooked.  Even overbrowned, it tasted great though.  Great."
52317,50022,5/16/2010,5,"I have so many banana bread recipes on file that I forgot to rate this one, and it kept getting lost in the shuffle. I had some buttermilk to use up, and made this recipe. Delicious! This is the one I'll go to from now on! Perhaps it should be re-named, though, because of the chocolate chips. I will admit that I used a mixer and did not make this by hand, but the bread still came out with a beautiful, soft, moist texture and great flavor. I made 4 mini-loaves with this recipe (6x3-inches), and ate one-third of one before I got them all wrapped! I definitely recommend making this in mini-loaves. They baked perfectly in 40 minutes--I placed the pans on a large baking sheet. Do try this recipe! Thanks, Tracy!"
917704,50022,6/10/2010,5,"My husband does not like sour cream and will not eat anything made with it. Therein lies the problem. I love the moistness that it adds to breads so I decided to give this recipe a try. So glad I did. So yummy. Made perfectly moist flavorful bread. I am making my second batch today with pecans and a streusel topping, not that it needs it..."
315055,50022,7/8/2010,5,"In the words of my BFF ""this is the best banana bread I've had in my whole life!"" and I would have to agree.  =)"
797590,50022,12/18/2010,5,My family loved this bread.  When I told them the name..they all agreed.  I am not a fan of a lot of spices in my Banana bread so this was perfect.  Thanks Tracy H.  I've been looking a long time for this recipe.
1118211,50022,3/17/2011,0,"This recipe was amazing - I substituted white chocolate chips for the regular chips and added some fresh cranberries.  It baked up moist and delicious.  I suggest (as prompted by other reviews) to bake in smaller loaves.  This does freeze well, although you probably won't have any left to freeze - it is that good."
427761,50022,6/14/2011,5,"I've made this recipe SO many times, and get rave reviews each and every time! I have yet to add the chocolate chips...I usually top mine with walnuts :)"
546021,50022,8/8/2011,5,"This is great.  Very sweet and delicious.  I used white chocolate chips and a little cinnamon and my husband said,""I think this is the best banana bread I've ever tasted.""! =)"
666947,50022,9/6/2011,5,"I made some changes to make it healthier and they turned out AMAZING! I only used 1/2 cup of margarine and substituted the rest with cinnamon applesauce. I also only used about 1 1/4 cup of sugar (I would have used 1 cup, but my bananas weren't completely black). Instead of eggs, I used Ener-G replacer so they are cholesterol free and vegan. I also used a cupcake pan instead of making a whole loaf and baked them for 30 minutes. That way I can freeze them and pull them out one serving at a time. Overall, they're moist and delicious. Keeper recipe."
591035,50022,12/18/2011,1,"sadly, not a fan of the texture or flavor of this recipe."
578914,50022,3/5/2012,5,"This is yummy bread! Seems pretty buttery and luscious! I'd love to play around with making it healthier. My poor bread didn't come out of tin very well, but we are more than happy to eat shredded bits! Thanks for sharing! My DH loved it!!! I made it in 2 tins anad I gave it about 55mins, need to grease my tins better... added choco chips and I think I would love it with walnus too!"
65197,230965,6/26/2007,5,"I didn't press the cukes, we loved the flavors of the white Balsamic and sour cream!   I used garlic chives from the garden!
Thank you Divaconviva!"
84364,50022,7/22/2012,5,"What an awesome recipe!  Have made it several times and it's never failed!  Have omitted the chocolate chips, added nuts - that's about the only thing I change up.  Have made muffins, bread and bundt cakes with this - Will sometimes poke it with a fork right out of the oven and pour a powdered sugar/milk glaze over it.  Everyone loves it - easy, quick and you can't mess it up!"
937635,50022,3/22/2013,5,"Great banana bread, I just didn&#039;t see the note to adjust the time down when making two loaves. So mine were a little brown. Otherwise they would have been really stellar."
2374500,50022,4/15/2013,5,"Very moist, loved it!"
958811,50022,10/1/2013,5,"I absolutely love, love , love this recipe. every time I make it , it does not last more than 1 hour in my home. The banana bread is barely cool, sometimes not even, before its gone. Great with the chocolate chips, and also great without.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for sharing this great recipe."
1802965531,50022,7/26/2014,0,"OH SO YUMMMY - made with 1/2 Wholemeal, 1/2 White flour, used only 1/2 the sugar (still more than sweet enough) and 4 Bananas. Made the buttermilk as suggested. Baked in 6 mini loaf tins (5.5cm x 10cm) for 30 mins. Love the crispy top &amp; loved by especially my 6 year old son and his friend. Thanks for the Recipe Tracy"
348402,50022,10/3/2014,5,Funny...I liked this way more than the sour cream version that the other reviewer liked.  I put the whole batch into one pan...and baked for 65 minutes....or just a tad over that.   If you bake til the toothpick comes out clean...the bread will be too dry.  I used whole wheat white flour and added walnuts.  The chocolate chips are a bit overwhelming...but that&#039;s never a bad thing in my book.  : )
2127500,50022,11/8/2014,0,"I have made this banana bread many times and it always turns out perfectly!  I omit the chocolate chips and it turns out moist, flavorful and delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!"

110727,65904,12/25/2006,5,Great stuff.  Thanks!
778986,89718,5/13/2008,5,"I have never been crazy about Tuna! However, we tried this and it is FANTASTIC!! Can't get enough of it! Tried it as is! Thanks for sharing!"
2001693784,109195,8/30/2017,1,"I tried to make it with &quot;Cup for Cup&quot; (brand) gluten-free flour. It was a disaster. The batter was thick and sticky like bread dough, and I couldn't smooth it out into the pan with the spatula because it was so sticky it would come away with the spatula. I have made this before with &quot;regular&quot; flour and it came out perfectly. Does anyone have an idea about how to do this with gluten-free flour? thanks."
21752,162646,10/11/2006,4,"I love creamy salad dressings, but can't always use them in a meal, since I don't mix meat with milk.  This is a wonderful solution!  I assumed that the tiny measures meant dried herbs, so I just tripled the amounts and used fresh.  Good call.  Very green and very yummy.  Next time I'll add more garlic, and perhaps some hot pepper.  Thanks!"
92796,188287,10/2/2006,4,"Made for Pick a Chef '06
Very nice flavor & pretty presentation.  The instructions do not say what to do w/ the soy milk -- so I added it after I pureed the vegetables.  I also added salt & pepper to the sauted shitake mushrooms.  Thanks for the submission -- One other suggestion: change the name of the recipe to identify it as a soup (e.g. Cream of Corn & Leek Soup w/ Shitake Mushrooms)"
88099,211992,9/29/2007,4,"We really enjoyed this salad, even my 7 year old GD.  I left out the cucumbers and olives but other than that made as is.  Nice combo of flavors.  thanks.  Made for PAC Fall 07."
37449,211992,6/2/2008,5,"I really enjoyed this salad! I added some red cabbage, fresh basil and cilantro and used green pepper in place of yellow. Thank you Alskann! Made for ZWT4 Italian Basil or Nutmeg challange."
632657,216865,2/8/2009,4,"Another recipe for my ""Favorites"" cookbook! The lime juice really stands out and the jalapenos - WOW! I added a little more salt to taste and some cumin seasoning. Great flavor and so good with a batch of homemade tortilla chips :) I made this for ""Tag It Red"" - Feb.'09."
2000014291,216865,6/20/2015,5,I use fresh squeezed lime instead of vinegar.
131126,230965,4/13/2008,5,This is a nice version of a cucumber salad.  It really would be perfect for a potluck or summer gathering.  I used far less salt and added a bit of dill.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!  Made for Spring '08 Pick A Chef.
337963,230965,5/28/2008,3,"We liked these, but felt they were a little bland.  Next time I will increase the vinegar and add some kosher salt at the end as well.  Made for ZWT, please see my rating system as I rate tougher than most."
463202,230965,5/30/2008,3,"Our family agreed with puppitypup that this was fairly bland.  I also felt like there was too much sour cream for this.  We really love cucumbers, but this needed more seasoning for us.  I went ahead and pressed the cucumber slices, and used fresh chives from my garden.  Made for ZWT4."
171790,230965,6/2/2008,4,This is a very nice cucumber salad. I didn't press the cucumbers and since I was only cooking for two I quartered all the ingredients except for the chives (which came from my garden). Made for ZWT 4.
143721,246780,7/30/2011,5,Very nice and easy recipe.  We have quite a few zucchini squash and I happened to have a pound of bulk sausage so this was a perfect recipe.  I used the thyme instead of the marjoram.  Will definitely do this again.  Thanks a quick and easy way to use up the excess squash.
532785,270343,5/29/2009,5,"Love these! They are so simple, yet so yummy =) Thanks for posting!"
1052873,281125,3/26/2013,5,Very good. Was a little bland for my taste but DH likes it that way and I just added some hot sauce. I couldn&#039;t find  pineapple salsa so used cranberry orange salsa and only had dried cilantro leaves. Made for 2013 Spring Safari PAC.
361452,291931,3/17/2008,5,Very good. My kids loved it and it was easy to make.
468146,291931,3/19/2008,4,"JESMom thanks for sharing a great recipe. It was easy to prepare and YUMMY to eat. I did add some minced garlic, onions, and mushrooms to the mixture to fit our tastebuds. I also used cream of chicken soup since I was out of the mushroom soup. DH and DS gobbled it up. DH even at the leftovers for lunch the next day! We will have this again."
107583,311260,2/15/2009,5,"Nice change from plain broccoli.  You didn't say what to do with the broccoli in the skillet, with the oil (step #2) so I skipped it, and just put the sauce on the steamed broccoli.  Very flavorful."
552864,328919,12/11/2008,4,"This was a really nice rice.  Went well with Recipe #100651 Chicken w/Apple, Cranberry & Bacon. Thank you for a nice recipe, we will be making this again!"
58104,328919,2/6/2009,5,"This was part of my http://www.recipezaar.com/menu/26073
menu #26073 I used rinsed red rice add it to the sauteed onions and apples. Sauteing for a minute then added the heated apple cider and spices. After 15 minutes added 2 cups fresh made hot turkey stock. and siimmered for 15 more minutes. Earthy and delish!"
345569,328919,9/23/2009,3,"This was a pretty plain recipe; it was good, but it basically tasted like rice!  It could use some more seasoning.  I used brown rice and so had to increase the cooking time / liquid a bit.  I used PAM instead of butter... and since the apple flavor didn't come through that strongly anyway, I think a red-skinned variety would give the dish a bit more color.  Thanks for posting."
358796,331421,1/27/2009,4,"Simple & pretty salad. Left out the jicama (didn't have any) and 1/2 lb. crab seemed like to much, so cut that in half. Overall nice tasting, however I think I'd rather leave out the crab next time and make it a edamame, jicama & avocado salad. even though I do love crab, it might have been better without. Thanks for posting."
452355,346494,2/26/2013,4,"We made this tagine in our tagine pot and it was fairly easy to prepare.  We thought maybe it needed a little more flavor (maybe more cumin, harissa?) so would add more of the seasonings next time.  We served with rice.  Made for Sun and Spice 2013."
1651233,418635,9/18/2011,5,Made this cake for my friend's birthday. It tasted awesome. I had left over filling and ganache which we later used on top of some sundaes. I also used kittencal's Chocolate Frosting (Recipe #89207). Thanks for a great recipe!
2000422020,418635,6/27/2016,5,"My husband always requests chocolate cake with raspberries for his birthday and I came across this recipe, which had a very positive review, so I decided to give it a try. It was a huge hit. I had so much fun making the cake, and my husband loved the filling - he had no idea there was cream cheese in it, which he will refuse to eat if he knows it's in there. The ganache was heavenly. I did not have a frosting bag to decorate the edge of the cake, so I just served the ganache as a sauce on the side. I am definitely keeping this recipe handy for his birthday next year. I think we have a winner."
57222,443705,4/4/2012,5,"Lovely cookies! They turn out sweeter than my regular chocolate chip cookie recipe - more sugar and milk chocolate will do that! ;-) I used a 1-inch cookie scoop and got 50 cookies, which took about 9 minutes to bake. Thank you for the recipe!"
2001090748,443705,7/16/2016,1,"Followed the directions, the cookies did not come out looking anywhere close to the way they look in the recipe. The chocolate chips are not melted, the cookie is crunchy on the outside and really chewy on the inside. While mixing in the beginning, the dough looked like a grain type substance. Really upset with this recipe."
27678,28517,12/1/2002,5,Who knew a few stalks of wilted celery and some potatoes could make something so yummy? This soup is really special and the lemon juice gives it a zesty zing. Thanks for a scrumptious lunch!
6357,28517,12/11/2002,4,"I made this as a part of our dinner tonight. I used 2 potatoes(medium sized), 3 stalks of celery, 6 green onions, 3 cups of Maggi Vegetable broth with onions, 3 cups of water, 10 spinach leaves, 2 carrots, juice of 1 1/2 lemons, a little over 1/4 tsp. salt and a little over 1 tsp. of dried basil. I omitted the oil and salt totally as the broth contains enough of salt and I didnt feel it necessary to saute the vegetables first. I prefer to boil them in the broth and then let the soup simmer. My family loves soup that has got more broth in it. Hence, I did not puree the soup. The steps in the method I follwed were 1,2, 4, 6,7,8, 11 and 12. I did not make the cheese toast. Inspite of having lemon juice in it, this soup, once ready, did not taste very strong in lemon. THANK GOD for small mercies or my mom wouldn't touch it, as she is down with cold lately and is my dear bro.
The good news now is that mom and dad enjoyed the soup immensely. Thanks so much for posting! Will make it more often:) "
136997,28517,2/10/2007,4,Very differant but delicious. I made half the recipe as there was only myself for dinner. :)
283390,28517,2/12/2007,5,"This was a very thick, satisfying soup. It was flavorful enough that I didn't bother to make the cheese toast; it was good on its own.  I especially like that the soup calls for ingredients I typically have on-hand (no extra shopping trip for me!).  Note: I only used three potatoes, but they were huge. Thanks for posting."
358740,28517,9/12/2007,5,I made this for our tea tonight although I microwaved the poatoes before adding them to the rest of the ingredients. I used the juice of large lemon that gave it a delicious lift.
350627,28517,4/10/2008,5,"We loved the lemony kick to this soup - way better than cream of celery! We didn't puree the soup completely, but that was just a matter of preference. We also followed a reviewer's recommendation and added oregano, basil, and a bay leaf. This is definite repeat - thanks for posting.  **Update** This recipe has become a house staple for a weekend lunch.  We make it everytime we have celery that's going to go bad, which is often.  Thanks again for the killer recipe!"
345884,28517,7/7/2008,5,"Outstanding!  My 6-year-old granddaughter even said I should enter it in a contest.  Imagine that!
Finally, a celery soup with no dairy or eggs.  I will be making it often.  I'd also like to try canning it so it'll always be on hand.  The wonderful ""bouquet"" lasts for a while.
I also tried it with a pinch of curry (about 1 tsp) to the recipe.  Great for a variation."
197023,28517,3/4/2009,5,"A totally yummy and very quick to prepare soup, which makes this a great week night recipe. I used my Recipe #135453 instead of chicken broth (where possible, and where practicable, I like my ingredients to be homemade) and used wine instead of water: one of my culinary foibles. Whenever I see water listed as an ingredient, I feel compelled to grab the opportunity to add something more flavoursome. The potatoes made this a wonderfully thick soup and we loved the lemon juice and spinach in this. I also added some minced garlic and several of my favourite herbs: rosemary, sage and thyme. We enjoyed this immensely on a quite chilly summer's evening, well comparatively chilly! ;) I didn't make the cheese toast; we ate our soup with warm crusty ciabatta rolls. This is a recipe I know we'll be enjoying again in the cooler months. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, Sharon. Made for Zaar Stars Tag."
82616,81851,8/30/2005,5,"Awesome !!!!!
Was craving some good ol home made bread today and this filled the bill. Thanks Pam :)"
60124,28517,5/6/2009,5,"loved this soup!
made as written, but used 1 litre chicken stock.
I didnt think 3 tablespoons of lemon juice would have much kick, but it was perfect.
My celery was stringy, so after blending with a stick blender, I put the mixture thru a sieve, and all the strings stayed in the sieve :) Excellent flavour!"
767215,28517,2/2/2010,5,Great soup!  It wouldn't seem that the ingredients could combine to produce so much taste but it was really terrific. I used vegetable broth and will try substituting wine next time.  Thanks so much for a delightful recipe.
88099,28517,10/16/2010,5,"This was just delicious.  The hint of lemon was perfect and added such a nice twist.  I made as written, making half the recipe for the two of us.  Thanks so much for a new favorite soup for the winter.  :)"
593927,28517,2/24/2011,5,"Really good for when we had a cold. I liked the lemon on top and did not blend the soup. I also did not make the cheese toasts as we are gluten & yeast free. DH didn't try it but DD (toddler) and I ate it all up over a couple of days. I used yellow fleshed potatoes, homemade vegetable stock, freshly squeezed lemon juice, a few more baby spinach leaves, sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, plus the rest. Made for Veggie Swap 31 ~ February 2011."

458402,28517,10/25/2012,0,Delicious and satisfying.  Easy to make and everyone loved it.
37449,29626,12/10/2007,4,The sauce is so good on these patties! I halved the recipe using a 7 1/2 oz. can of salmon. Thanks for a good recipe! Made for the Asian Seafood Tag game.
463202,34903,4/24/2007,4,"We really enjoyed this!  I loved having a good tasting curry that was cooked in the oven (no curry yellow to clean off of the stove).  This was easy to prepare and had a nice balance of flavors.  DH asked me to keep the recipe for the sauce.  I wish I could give this 5 stars, but picky picky DD didn't like it, and it is listed as a kid-pleaser.  The adults all thought it was great!"

Chance..."
60859,81851,4/1/2004,5,"This recipe turned our perfectly.  I have been searching for a basic bread that did not crumble or fall apart.  I let the machine do the mixing and baking and followed the instructions to the letter.  Thanks Pamela,  I'll be making it often.  The family loved it."

248602,81851,12/7/2006,5,THIS WAS THE BEST WHITE Bread. I have tried soo many recipes. even the recipe that came with my kenwood wasnt as good as this one too.. I made the rolls as well they came out great! Thanks Pamela!
622588,81851,10/23/2007,5,I used this for the buns and they were AWESOME!!! I think i baked a little too long but they were still amazing thanks
354135,81851,2/22/2008,5,This was truly a failure-free recipe for me! I've tried several basic white bread recipes meant for a breadmaker and was disappointed in all of them. This recipe came out quite spectacular! Great consistency and a decent size loaf. Thanks!
854759,81851,11/16/2008,5,This is a great recipe!  I totally omit the powdered milk (my daughter is allergic) and it still turns out great!

No need for BF, I just use AP and increase the yeast to 2-1/4 teaspoons (one packet dry, active). We LOVE this recipe! Rises like it will carry us away, nice, yeasty flavor and makes for very fluffy rolls. I always use the ABM for mixing and the first rise, remove it, roll it out with the rolling pin, then roll it up into a large loaf or ball it up into about 12 large rolls. Love this recipe for making my own dry breadcrumbs, too, if there is any left over (not very often!). Super! Thanks for posting a really easy great recipe!"

2124019,81851,11/18/2012,5,"I was about to throw out my bread machine, then I tried this recipe and created a perfect loaf of white bread that my whole family loved.  I have the Black & Decker B6000C, and every loaf I made (3 before this one), was either too high and stuck to the top, or got stuck on the sides/bottom and was mangled coming out of the machine.  For this loaf I used the 2lb, light setting, added a 15 minute delay time (as instructed in the recipe), used a plastic bread knife around the edges after backing was complete, then jiggled the heck out of the bread pan to release the loaf and it came out perfectly.  Yeah, I can finally make a great loaf of white bread.  Thanks!"

428885,81851,11/14/2013,5,"I agree with  cindyp1958, this is a great, great, recipe. I too, had given up hope in producing a decent sandwich bread (unless you bought a 4.00 loaf from Wegmans) in my bread machine. All of them were just awful - and worse by the next day. This really holds up well, and it perfect for anything you might chose. I did not change one thing. I wanted to test the recipe fully.....and this is just simply a wonderful recipe that gives you a suburb loaf of bread. Thanks, Pamela!"
1802550428,81851,3/4/2014,5,"I tried this today in my Black and Decker B6000C and it worked GREAT!  The one that comes with my book is only 3lb loaf and it sticks to the top of the lid.

I am satisfied with the inside texture. I appreciate all your reviews.
2000529038,81851,10/7/2015,4,"Thank you!!  I have not used my bread maker in 5 yrs. After i pampered my family with warm baked bread daily, they ask recently, why i was not still doing this. I told them that during our move, that we lost a few things, and my cook books were one of the few. So after searching many many web sites....this one came up on google and it was my recipe for my bread maker!  Now, our home will have that warm cozy smell of breads and other baked goods!!  Thanks again~"
2001410294,81851,3/11/2017,0,I've tried this twice. I have the same bread machine and both times it stuck to the lid. Which results in the very top of the bread not being baked properly. Any suggestions on how to fix the problem? Maybe less yeast?
2001566684,81851,6/25/2017,0,Thank you!:)
217634,81851,7/18/2017,5,"It tastes great, but totally was touching the lid, before it even started baking. It's about 1.5x a regular loaf, so next time I'll reduce the recipe to 3/4 and see how that goes. I omitted the powdered milk due to an allergy too."
2002128565,81851,4/24/2018,5,"Nice size loaf, great texture and delicious flavor."
57222,122826,3/23/2006,4,"Great, thick soup - the salsa really gives a lot of flavour, I think I'll even reduce the amount of salt next time! Very easy to make. Thanks for a tasty lunch soup recipe! "
228458,122826,3/14/2007,5,"This is a great, easy recipe on those nights you want warm soup but don't have time to simmer for hours. I didn't have to simmer mine for the whole hour; 45 minutes did the trick. I also didn't bother adding the salt because my salsa had quite a bit to begin with."
2868234,221149,6/18/2013,5,"This is a fantastic recipe!  I decided to make it into an entree.  I made the &quot;paste&quot; the morning of with little issue (I do not recommend using a Vitamix -- it was too large. I had to use our smaller bullet to get the ingredients to the correct consistency).  We like food a tad more spicy, so I added ONE extra Thai Chili and a bit more fresh ginger.  With just a few tweaks, I ended up with tons of broth adorning approximately 4 pounds of mussels, a few springs of cilantro for good measure, and loads of fresh bread toasted and drizzled with olive oil to dunk.  This was a pre-Father&#039;s Day dinner hit. I will be making it again!  Cheers."
192264,251399,9/18/2007,2,"This was just OK. I had to use flounder instead of sole, since my store didn't have it. I liked it better hot than chilled. I think maybe the pimento stuffed olives really turned me off. It was very interesting to try."
37449,264260,1/19/2008,5,I really enjoyed this on a cold winter evening! I served it with a game of boggle! Thanks Paula. Made for Zaar tag.
538524,264260,2/8/2008,5,"so i made this due to a tag game on accident, but i couldnt be happier because it was sooooo tasty! this tea really hit the spot and would definately be perfect for the holidays or on a cold night! thanks 4 the great recipe shelby jo!"
220348,264260,4/10/2008,5,"This is fantastic! I loved it. Of course I had to since I love cranberry juice more than any other kind. It went well with the orange juice, too. I used dried cinnamon instead, because I already had it on hand."
394085,264260,5/12/2008,4,Oh this is GOOD!  I may try it with slightly less sugar the next time since I like tart and this is quite (but not too) sweet.  I certainly will make it again. It'll be terrific cold in the summer too.
61660,264260,10/14/2008,5,"Fantastic!!!  Loved the cinnamon, loved teh cranberry and oj together, loved the aroma!!  Great hot beverage!!"

498271,264260,11/10/2008,5,"Very easy, comforting and delicious!  I scaled the recipe to 2 servings so I used a dash of ground cinnamon instead of the sticks.  I think this would be great to make the whole batch, then store it in the fridge to heat up as needed.  Thanks for posting this recipe!"

430471,264260,11/25/2008,5,Loved this. The slight taste of lemon really made it wonderful.  What is not to love about orange juice and cranberry juice.  Made for Football Tag 2008 #11
128473,264260,11/30/2008,5,"This is so good. The perfect drink for the cold days we are experiencing. I enjoyed it very much. I loved the addition of the orange & lemon juice.  The cinnamon makes this nice and spicy, warm and tingly. Thanks for sharing this quick and easy to make recipe...its a winner."
305531,264260,12/28/2008,5,"Yum! I made this the day after Christmas while the grandkids were out sledding down our hill. I made it on the stovetop, then put it in the crockpot to keep it warm. It made the kitchen smell wonderful and the kids of all ages enjoyed this when they came in from the cold. Thanks Shelby for a great tea. Congrats on your Football win for week #16."
174096,264260,12/17/2009,5,Excellent!  The flavor is wonderful!  This is a wonderful drink for a cold night.  Thanks for sharing!
1376597,264260,12/4/2014,5,"This is so good! Thanks for posting it! I&#039;ve made it several times, including super-cold nights for my book club and we&#039;ve really enjoyed it. Great cold-weather treat!"
1803509672,264260,1/24/2015,5,This is SOOO GOOD!! Perfect for cold nights or when you&#039;re fighting the flu bug!
80353,288495,7/1/2008,4,"This made rather a lot of marinade, which turned even more once the chicken's own juices were incorporated.  I think you could easily use 1/2 cup white wine (or apple juice, as I did) and get more intensely-flavoured pan juices in the end.  Having said that, this was very flavourful and juicy chicken and couldn't have been easier (with my pre-split chickens).  I did up the garlic considerably - just can't get enough of it with chicken!"
679953,288495,9/1/2008,5,"Very easy to make.  Boy, this was REALLY GOOD.  I use dry white wine. This also was very flavorable.  Very enjoyable, and many thanks for a #1 dinner that we all enjoyed."
350938,288495,9/19/2010,5,I used 4 chicken legs (thighs and drumsticks) and followed recipe as directed with great results. The pan juices are amazing. I drizzled them over mini roasted potatoes and they paired very well together. Thanks for sharing your recipe :)
1047126,290864,12/22/2010,4,"Nice, moist cake! And wonderfully lactose free! Thanks for posting. :)"
175827,304159,10/5/2008,5,This was so delicious!  It made it's own fantastic caramel syrup that we drizzled over top.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!
602094,304159,5/16/2010,5,"Wow this was so simple to make and so worth every minute. The hardest part was coring the apples. I did have to cook it a tad longer, but it's easy to see when they are done. The apples were cooked perfectly, the crust was so good and it went great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. We drizzled some carmel on top of it all as well. I'll definitely be making these again!"
64625,317447,11/10/2009,5,"Made this tonight along with nugget potatoes and a Greek salad, and it was VERY good! Used our electric grill, and blue cod was my choice of fish. I wasn't too sure about the boat thing..I placed a strip of parchment paper on top of the aluminum foil I was using and put the fish on that, simply wrapping it up tightly to prevent leakage. Bottom line: this was a really tasty meal!  3 months later --- I love preparing fish fillets this way, and use this recipe often. Photo shows basa fillet accompanied by garlic and parsley orzo and sauteed rutabaga and carrot. Now that the outdoor grill is put away for the winter, the oven works just as well..done in about 20 mins. Thanks again."
601528,343902,2/28/2009,4,Yummy!  I had chorizo sitting in the fridge that I had to use and I was in the mood for a breakfast burrito.  This fit the bill!
144204,351368,1/27/2009,5,"Made this for dinner yesterday, let me say this 1st off it is very filling & cheesey. We got 5 servings yesterday and there is 3-4 left over the kids are goona eat soon. Everyone enjoyed this. 
We will be eating this again. 
Thanks for the post"
1154570,351368,8/8/2011,4,"I hate to be one of THOSE reviewers (:D), but...<br/><br/>This is a great base recipe. Tasty, but there were a couple issues. First, I didn't feel like one can of diced tomatoes had quite the liquid for the dish. I ended up adding some pasta sauce, but I think tomato sauce would work, too. I had to add quite a bit. Next, it needed a little pizzaz, so I added some garlic and seasonings. Additionally, I think this is a dish you could very easily make much healthier with low-fat CC, low fat cheese, etc. It makes a TON of food, and is a hit with my whole house!"
362184,352388,8/3/2009,4,"These were very good! I am new at the muffin-baking, so I had some technical difficulties with them getting stuck to the cups. I meant to add some fresh chives from the garden to them, and think I might add that next time. Thanks for the amazing and versatile recipe!"
899620,370860,4/22/2010,5,"This was delicious! I used beef cube steaks, and didn't have club soda I substituted with beer. Also, I just used 2 cans of plain condensed cream of mushroom soup. I did everything else by the recipe and it turned out great. I will definitely be making this again!"
280271,389614,3/7/2010,5,What a wonderful veggie dish. I loved the ease in preparing this. I made as posted with the exception of cutting the recipe in half. It worked great. This will be made again and again. Thanks for posting. :)
361931,410584,3/1/2010,4,"This was pretty good flavor wise.  I added more cheese than stated.  However, it does make a very large empanada, and I think I would like to play around making this into smaller pies.  Thanks!"
39835,425582,12/11/2010,5,Great Christmas cookies filled with jam! I had all the spices but used regular sugar instead of the caster sugar. Thanks for sharing!
59686,426045,6/28/2010,4,"When making this coffee, I cut the recipe in half. This is pretty good, but I found the coffee didn't thicken up as much as I had hoped. The coffee flavored ice cubes didn't really harden in the freezer, plus I had to use a butter knife to remove the coffee cubes from the ice cube trays. I ended up adding the entire flavored coffee cubes to an empty cool whip container, (placing it in the freezer) and I would scoop out the slightly frozen flavored coffee with a spoon when I would mix up a drink. I found 3 tablespoons of the coffee mixture, is equal to 2 coffee flavored ice cubes. I did enjoy this beverage even more, by adding 1 tablespoon of Smucker's Caramel Sundae Syrup to the flavored coffee before blending it. Plus I also drizzled some of the caramel syrup ontop the coffee which I also topped with some Reddi Whip Whipped Topping. I think the caramel syrup makes this iced coffee taste even better. Thanx for the recipe GingerlyJ."
240552,433627,10/11/2010,5,"This was so good!  We had this SONday morning after church.  I had made homemade kaiser rolls and made my own dijonaisse like you suggested, since we didn't have any on hand.  Got rave reviews around the table!  Thank you so much for sharing!"
679953,433627,12/1/2014,5,"Nice flavorful sandwich.   Made the dijonaisse, and it was very good.  Made  8 of these 2 for each of us.  ! for lunch, and 1 for mid afternoon.  Made these on some onion burger buns."
75218,28757,5/22/2004,5,"Wonderful!  A great way to use up an ""oversupply"" of summer rhubarb!  My husband and son ate it and they usually won't touch rhubarb.  I have also made it with different flavors of jello and cake mixes.  (ex:  strawberry cake mix and strawberry jello)"
570795,28757,9/12/2007,4,I made this and brought it to work. Everyone loved it and it was all gone in no time. It may have been just a little too lemony for me so I may try it again and just use a regular yellow cake mix instead of the lemon cake mix. All in all though it was very good. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
40560,39266,12/20/2002,4,"Mike, I'm giving you 4 stars because it is soooo close to my mothers recipe.  I will try it soon and then rerate it.  I am going to try the lea/perrins in my meat....thats sounds good."
32772,79378,12/22/2003,5,This is similiar to a recipe that I have posted except mine calls for lemonade.  I had extra lemon juice on hand from my holiday baking and this worked just as well.
2863030,79378,6/18/2013,5,"I added strawberries, too! It makes yummy strawberry lemonade!"
137634,79378,4/26/2004,5,"This was a very good and easy recipe. The only problem I had was getting the ice crushed up, but that was mainly just my blender. I also added a little more sugar for my taste, only because I like a sweet taste over a more sour one."
59780,79378,5/29/2004,5,Great COOL recipe! We're finally getting some nice weather here and this really hit the spot. I did add a bit more sugar as we prefer a sweeter lemonade. My fridge dispenses crushed ice which is perfect for this recipe and does not over work the blender. Thanks for posting!
126418,79378,5/31/2004,5,"Yummy-Yummy, very refreshing!"
131698,79378,11/9/2004,5,"It's still pretty warm here in West Texas, so this was a very nice refresher!  I can't wait to serve this at next summer's dinner parties."
85730,79378,5/24/2005,5,Simple and tasty.  My blender didn't really like so much ice but I coaxed it into cooperation.
241601,79378,12/4/2005,5,"Extremely easy and CHEAP!!!  It was delicious!! We will definately make it over and over.  I dont like lemonade, but dang, this was awesome.  Thanks SO much for the recipe!!!"
185387,79378,12/28/2005,5,"Oh my gosh, so glad I found this drink from the link on the front page. I love lemonade and slurpee's and this recipe is a great, easy recipe that will be made over and over again.. I love how slushy it is. Thanks for a great recipe.
:)"
36944,79378,1/22/2006,5,"This was delicious!  It was also fast, easy and uses ingredients I always have.  My GD's will love this!  Thanks for the recipe Ang!"
176615,79378,2/10/2006,5,Quick and refreshing! I used Splenda with good results. Not too sweet or too sour. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
76535,79378,5/29/2006,5,Frosty and delicious! I added more sugar to mine. Thanks for the posting!
330900,79378,7/5/2006,5,"I want to correct my previous post. I bought a new measuring cup and misread it. I actually used six cups of ice and a little more sugar than the recommended 1/2 cup. I can't imagine what it would taste like with only 3 cups of ice. It probably would be way too powerful. My six cups of ice are perfect for me. Others seem to be happy with four cups of ice. Initially try fours cups of ice and keep adding one cup of ice as needed. As I said, six cups of ice are perfect for me."
37449,79378,7/17/2006,5,"A yummy treat! Be careful, I got a brain freeze from drinking too fast!"
209255,79378,7/21/2006,5,"This is GREAT!  I love how sour it is.  It isn't too sour, and it isn't too sweet.  I would say that it is PERFECT! I can see this becoming a staple in the summer in my non air conditioned house!  Thanks!"
45737,79378,8/13/2006,5,"Excellant hot summer recipe.  I will make this again. I like the 
tartness of it as it was just right for me."
109110,79378,1/6/2007,5,My kids made these all summer long. Easy and refreshing.
191050,79378,4/23/2007,5,Loved it!!!  Perfect recipe and wouldn't change a thing!  Thank You!
216320,79378,8/5/2007,4,"My daughter and I loved this.  Very refreshing.  Gotta watch out for that brain feeze with this one because it's so yummy you're tempted to drink it too fast ;-)
Thanks!"
168462,79378,8/6/2007,5,This was easy to make and tasted great-very sour. Thanks for the recipe.
810524,79378,4/5/2008,5,This slushy is so smoothe and refreshing! I had something like this at a Fair when I was younger and never found the product after that. Now I can make it anytime!
424680,79378,4/20/2008,5,"What better for a warm day, & a nice change from the usual lemonade, which I still enjoy! Also enjoyed the break from squeezing the lemons! Thanks for sharing! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in this Spring's Pick-A-Chef]"
189616,79378,7/15/2008,5,Fantastic! Like another poster I used crushed ice and a heaping 1/2 c. of sugar.
576675,79378,3/7/2010,5,"I made it yesterday, and it was amazing! I totally forgot the water, but it was still really great! Thanks for posting, Ang11002!"
1506604,79378,4/18/2010,4,It was okay but for some reason I did not get the 'slushy' consistency with my blender.
858860,79378,12/6/2010,5,"Quick, Easy, Delicious, and a much Healthier Alternative to most fruit juice. Thanks!"
1677099,79378,7/30/2011,5,"I make this by cutting the peel off the giant lemons from my tree and removing seeds.  This will always  make better if you have a blender on steroids (Blentec or Vitamix).  Sometimes I replace the water with a spirit like vodka, bourbon or whatever I am in the mood to have.  Oooooh, I think I will go make one now."
1802701212,79378,4/27/2014,0,"I don&#039;t know how many this was supposed to serve, but I drank it all. The consistency was great and it was gone in 5 minutes,"
906665,79378,8/16/2014,5,So delicious and refreshing. Way better than a Slurpee!
1803086971,79378,8/30/2014,5,This was so easy to make and it&#039;s perfect for a hot day.
969623,79378,7/19/2015,5,"Easy recipe, came out great.  Perfect ending for dinner on the porch on a hot and humid night.  Thank you for sharing.  One note:  When reading the recipe I though it called for concentrated juice.  You can just use regular lemon juice and it comes out perfectly!  Going to try it with vodka next time."
2001086114,79378,7/12/2016,5,Great! I added some strawberries to sweeten it a bit more &amp; it turned out fantastic! Such an easy recipe that is so good!
2000079505,79378,1/4/2017,0,"The consistency was perfect (I made it in my vitamix). I used lime juice instead of lemon, halfing the amount. The ratio of sweet to sour was a bit off for me though, probably because of the substituting. Next time I will add a bit more lime juice."
2001463104,79378,3/30/2017,5,The Vitamix made this like a dream. It's perfectly slushy and sweet and sour all at once! I like that you could mix this up with frozen strawberries or sub in liquor or make it lime flavored or whatever. It's super easy with great results.
2001488792,79378,4/14/2017,0,I have this every day its amazing!
2001581353,79378,6/12/2017,5,It's sooo good
2001615623,79378,7/6/2017,5,Great recipe. Easy to adjust to taste and so good. Good to make with kids too.
195137,112169,9/27/2006,4,Great quick meal. Make sure to pound the steak thin or else you'll need to add cooking time.
58104,120813,6/6/2005,5,Doubling is a very good idea! These delish little appi will dissapear fast! And are fun to make! Just go easy on the egg. Thanks for posting!
142021,120813,6/20/2005,5,Awesome recipe! Very impressive looking and even better tasting - thanks for sharing the recipe.
149363,120813,7/24/2005,5,"Tasty little morsels!! We just loved these, and they were very impressive to serve.
Well written and easy to follow recipe, this will be a keeper in my home!
Thanks Evelyn!!"
147027,120813,10/30/2005,5,"Omg these were great! I suggest taking Rita's advise about the egg though, mine were a little runny so I added more feta to firm them up. These were so much fun to make, plus even more fun to devour! Our guests loved these, they certainly didn't last long! thanks for posting!"
160947,120813,10/31/2005,4,"Just realized I'd forgotten to review this wonderful recipe. I took it to a wine party about a month ago..it was a real hit.  Nothing too difficult about making them. However, I also took Rita's advice and went easy on the egg. They turned out perfect. In fact I got a big thumbs up from a chef that attended the party. Definitly will be making these again! Thanks much "
197023,120813,11/5/2005,5,"Well, Evelyn, I took your advice and doubled the recipe, and served only about a quarter of these with Cookgirl’s fabulous It's All Greek to Me Meatballs Recipe #127746.  The rest are frozen, so we’ll be enjoying these over the next few weeks!  I made these nearly exactly to the recipe.  I just made one simple addition: I added a handful of finely chopped baby spinach leaves.  These puffs were just SO delicious.  And the instructions were so easy to follow.  I’ll be making these regularly: everyone just LOVED them!  Thank you for sharing this scrumptious recipe."
180437,120813,6/26/2006,5,"I made these for our greek class end of term ""nibbles night"" . I made double the quantity and added a teaspoon of tapenade . yummy ! and so easy to make, I will definitely make these again.  "
209715,120813,8/12/2006,5,"These little Feta Puffs are delish.
A little fussy to make ,but well worth the trouble. I did not read the recipe as carefully as I should have and added too much egg,I then added more Feta and they worked out ok. "
87160,120813,8/24/2006,4,"Very delicious with very little effort.  These are so easy to eat that they will go before many other appetizers.  I thought the strong feta would shy people away, but they loved it."
351810,120813,9/12/2006,5,"Delicious! Only change I made was to increase the number of Tblspns for both cream & egg from 1 Tblspn to 2.  Tested these out on my husband, who approved. Have since made them for family and friend gatherings, everyone loves them. Even my greek family who have being making feta pies their whole life. "
9869,120813,12/27/2006,5,"These are delicious, easy to prepare and taste great. Very popular and very moreish. Thanks for sharing."
129992,120813,12/28/2006,5,"I made these for my sister's annual Christmas party.  I was a little skeptical because when I assembled them, they weren't very pretty.  I thought for sure I'd messed them up.  But then I popped them in the oven and when I opened the door to take them out, I couldn't believe it!  They were beautiful! I couldn't wait to taste them so I popped one in my mouth and I almost fell over.  These little morsels are DEEE-licious.  I honestly wanted to pull the plate off the buffet table, hide in the bathroom, and eat them all myself. But I didn't and everyone else loved them.  Thanks for another great recipe evelyn!"
277825,120813,1/11/2007,4,"Just had the most wonderful bonding session with my son's girlfriend tonight, making these for dinner.  We talked, laughed, confided and enjoyed ourselves as we multiplied the recipe 8 times! so easy to prepare.  We went for the milk instead of cream, and felt next time we'd go for the cream or simply more milk, as they were a tad dry, but very tasty.  Possibly dry because we used sheets of pre-rolled puff pastry. Different variations containing bacon or chicken breast or even some vegies would have been lovely too.  Yes we would definitely make these again, but probably en masse with 3 varieties : ))    Thankyou Evelyn for an evening both of us will always remember."
95810,120813,2/5/2007,5,These are very addicting! Another terrific appetizer from Evelyn.  I found that these freeze very well already baked as well.  Just pop back in the oven for a few minutes to recrisp.  Yummy!  My kids were sneaking into the freezer and snacking on these frozen.  They take a few minutes to put together but are easy to do ahead and are so worth it.
158086,120813,3/11/2007,5,These were so fancy looking and so wonderful....we really enjoyed these..
142617,120813,3/19/2007,5,"These are absolutely wonderful!  What a surprise when you open the oven door and find these beautiful puffs.  I'm thinking of trying other fillings - I buy a blue cheese brie that I think would be wonderful.  Of course, I have ruined the diet I started this morning!  Oh well, I'll start my diet tomorrow - I wouldn't have missed these for anything.  Thanks, Evelyn, I love your recipes."
283251,120813,4/11/2007,4,"I made these last night. FANTASTIC! They turned out just like the photo. :) I took your advice and doubled the recipe and froze the second half. We both loved these and I was very upset that the dog found the leftovers and ate them!!! HEY! No fair! :(
I'll be making these again soon. Next time I might put a small strip of roasted red pepper across the top of the feta... Or some olive paste... So many options for such a simple, wonderful recipe. Thanks for sharing. :)"
500466,120813,6/18/2007,5,These were absolutely AWESOME!!I used an herbed feta because that is what I had on hand and they were so good.  I thought they were going to be a hassle to prepare but it went smoother than I expected.  I can't wait to make them again! Thanks so much for the great recipe.
440519,120813,7/15/2007,5,"Used this recipe to test out for a wedding that I'll be catering in October. The bride, groom, and both sets of parents loved it.

The only thing I changed was the method to make them and added some chopped green onions to the feta-thyme mixture.  Absolutely delicious!"
287829,120813,7/16/2007,4,"These went well at a dinner party I hosted this weekend.
 They were fairly easy to put together. I made them two days prior to using them and kept them in freezer. They tasted good!
 Next time I am going to add some seasonings to the feta mixture to add a little more zing to them.
I love your greek recipes evelyn!"
399465,120813,8/22/2007,5,"I'm not buying frozen cheese puffs again!! This is the best cheese puff recipe i've tasted. These babies should come with a warning; ""HIGHLY ADDICTIVE"".
They're still good with dried thyme leaves too. I didn't use any paper or flour, if your puff pastry comes separated by a plastic sheet just work straight from it, chill and they come straight off the plastic, onto a lightly greased surface with veg oil to avoid sticking. Evelyn thanks for sharing."
493276,120813,1/5/2008,5,"I used this mixture, it was amazing!! Everyone loved it. I did not use puff pastry though, I used a refrigerated tube of dinner rolls... which I rolled out then cut in half and stuffed with the filling. This was a great idea and I will make them again. They freeze and reheat beautifully too."
625696,120813,1/12/2008,2,"I made these for a holiday party and I wasn't real impressed.  Usually feta cheese has a ton of flavor for me, but these were just kind of tasteless.  They weren't awful - but I probably won't make again.  They sounded really good though!!"
230860,120813,1/26/2008,3,I too used the idea of crescent dinner rolls since the store was out of puff pastry.  They have a nice taste to them but it is a bit subtle in comparison to what I expect from feta.  I used a tamoto basil flavored Feta.  To assemble them I just left the crescents in the long rectangles they come in and pinched all the seams together giving me two long rectangles.  I then spread the mix on them and rolled them up like a pinwheel.  They came out looking very pretty!  I did forget the thyme though so maybe that would have boosted the flavors.  Still a nice appetizer to go along with our Greek Lemon Chicken Soup!
171790,120813,6/8/2008,5,"I made these with puff pastry as described in the recipe. They are very easy to make with light, airy and delicious results. I will definitely be making them again. Thx for posting."
107135,504394,3/11/2014,5,"first off, miss you girl. 2nd rudy mom makes these and shes czech , very good basic recipe  warm comfort food  made for pammyowls cookathon"
130819,120813,11/30/2008,5,Once again enticed by a photo - perfect timing as I was needing some new ideas for those holiday  appetizers. Loved these Feta Puffs! Happy to know they are freezer friendly which is a real plus. Thank you for another of your recipes - this appetizer a winner at our house!
494593,120813,2/13/2009,5,I served these as appetizers for my Greek themed dinner.  We really loved these light delicious puffs!  It's great that they are freezer friendly as I made up a double batch and froze some to have later.  We loved them before our main meal!
385423,120813,4/22/2009,4,"these were really good even though I messed them up.  I ended up saving the filling that was runny, which was my fault.  I didn't read it properly and put in the whole egg.  I put the puff pastry in little muffin cups and put in the filling and baked them.  It ended up turning out fine but I don't care too much for thyme.  I'll make them again and this time I promise I'll read the recipe better."
471652,120813,4/23/2009,5,"These are fantastic and oh, so easy!  They are also a wonderful base for experimentation.  I have sometimes added some chopped sundried tomatoes which have been packed in oil and then drained.  I also don't blend the filling in the food processor, but rather just leave it ""chunky"".  Usually I don't need the heavy cream or milk.  Thanks evelyn for another super recipe!"
262312,120813,5/22/2009,5,"fantastic!!  i thought these were easy to put together.  i had all the ingredients on hand, plus i added some fresh parsley to the mixture. i also make fork marks along the edges, which turned out beautifully!! i read the directions wrong and put the thyme in the mixture.  luckily, i realized it just in time to put it on top before baking!  this was a very impressive and tasty dish!!  everyone raved about it!  i will make these again for sure!  a great appy for greek meals.  thanks for another keeper, ev!!"
665137,120813,10/18/2009,5,These take a little practice to get just right but even the messy ones turn out pretty. I made these for my DBF's son's wedding rehearsal dinner and they were a hit. I'm going to play around with the stuffing next time so this is a great base for experimentation. Thanks much!
176481,120813,12/25/2009,4,"These were good, had them for our Christmas Eve snack night.  I think they could have used a bit more feta or something.  I think next time we will try them with Asiago & minced ham.  Thanks for posting."
541353,235347,7/19/2007,5,My favorite my grabdma used this anytime fish was cooked  you have to try this one! Easy to make
452940,235347,4/19/2008,5,"Wonderful! We reduced the recipe to 1/2 (3 servings) as there was just the two of us and we got 14 hushpuppies from it. We made this as directed but used more sugar (3 tbsp total for the 1/2 batch) as we like sweet hushpuppies, and used dried minced onion. We love the tip about dipping the spoon in the oil, it worked wonderfully. Thanks for keeper of a recipe. :)"
552471,235347,7/10/2008,5,"I have been looking for a recipe for hushpuppies that was a ""true"" hushpuppy, and I found it ! These are perfect !! I didn't change a thing. The only thing is I should of made more. Thanks so much !"
675543,235347,8/18/2008,5,Wow! These were great. I should have cut the batch in 1/2 tho. I threw half of the batter away b/c it's just too much for 2 peeps. My bf was in love with these. I will definately be making these again. Thanks to your g-ma and u for sharing!
628127,235347,10/19/2008,5,very delicious and easy!!  The sweeet corn makes the difference!
259154,235347,11/6/2008,5,These things are amazing. I made these HUGE hushpuppies and they were easy and sooooooo good. I have already given the recipe to a friend of mine to make them. These are a definite keeper for me!!!!
699079,235347,6/9/2009,5,"What a delicious recipe for hush puppies!  It was my first time making them, and I wanted a recipe with corn in it (not just corn meal).  They turned out moist and were a perfect side dish to a crab and shrimp dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe that we will definitely use again."
755277,235347,7/15/2009,5,"These are perfect! Great texture, flavor and moist. I've made a couple times now, first time I followed the recipe exactly and 2nd time I added some cajun seasoning. We really enjoy them both ways."
328405,235347,2/20/2010,5,"This were easy and delicious! The only change I made was to use Season All seasoned salt instead of regular salt. I liked these so much that I posted about them on my blog, with step by step photos: http://lambaround.blogspot.com/2010/02/easiest-hush-puppies-ever-and-they-even.html"
376189,235347,4/5/2010,5,"These were awesome. Ate them with jumbo shrimp parmesan (Recipe #42169). A bit heavy b/c of the vegetable oil, but definitely the best hush puppies I've ever had."
909692,235347,12/23/2013,5,Very good!  This one is a keeper!
170959,235347,1/18/2017,5,"I cannot begin to tell you how wonderful these hushpuppies are!!! Better than any I've ever had, and my boyfriend said they were the best ones he's had in his lifetime. When I told him the recipe called for creamed corn, he made a funny face. But I told him &quot;Trust me on this one.&quot; I used my deep fryer, and used Crisco's frying oil. Perfect!! Definitely making these again, and will never buy store-bought ones again."
523286,284056,7/24/2008,4,Easy to put together.  However I used a mashed pear in place of the applesauce as I didn't have any and I used a tablespoon of condensed milk in place of the date sugar. Smelt yummy while cooking and quite tasty too. Thanks for sharing.
901608,284056,8/4/2008,4,I love that it was quite simple. I didn't have the shredded coconut and decided not to add sugar; leaving it to the raisins and bannanas to sweeten the bars. I will definitely make again maybe with some slight variations! Thanks!
249657,284056,9/2/2008,5,"I was in the middle of making these for a coworkers birthday and the panic of ""OMG too healthy!"" set in so I covered them in chocolate. Funny, it worked and they were eaten with glee. They are really close to my breakfast bar recipe I use which I noticed when I was half done mixing them. Not very dessert-y but works with the chocolate. I made them in texas sized muffin tins and then quartered them. Makes me wonder if I should mix in a handful of chocolate chips the next time I make breakfast bars. Hrm!"
1404393,284056,4/18/2011,1,I followed the recipe to the letter (left out the sugar) and they were just awful.  They were rubbery and very thin.  I definitely wouldn't make them again.
201581,330555,11/8/2009,5,"I had the butcher chop the legs for me, and went light on the salt. Then I served myself a bowlful with Recipe #317697 cooked in it (what I called ""fat noodles"" when I was growing up.) It was delicious. I also used 2 cups to cook Recipe #286497 and 3 cups in Recipe #258202 and still have a few cups in the freezer for future recipes. This is definitely going in my OAMC rotation. Thanks for sharing this recipe DrGaellon. Made for My3Chefs Nov '09."
424680,333474,8/9/2011,5,"Left out an ingredient (the creme de cassis) when making this one, but sharing it with an AA attendee wouldn't have worked out too well! Still, we thoroughly enjoyed the berry & buttermilk combo ~ Different, but satisfying, & on a warm morning, very enjoyable! Thanks for sharing it! [Made & reviewed in Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup tag]"
852554,411145,4/26/2014,5,"This was great!  I had regular milk instead of soy, and my berries were blueberries and blackberries, but other than that, all good!  My little girl loved it too and since she&#039;s a picky eater, it was nice to get  a little protein in her. Made for PAC Spring 2014"
28087,415441,6/9/2010,5,"This is a great side dish! Simple way to make potatoes with wonderful flavor. I scaled this down to one serving, and it still came out perfectly. Served with Recipe #174598. These will be made often :)

780172,415441,6/11/2010,5,"Needed something to go with my Pork kababs tonight and these were quick and had a great taste.

895132,422854,6/11/2010,5,"This was awsome - DH raved about it, and I barely could stop eating. Made it exactly as written except for the carrots - used sweet potatoes instead which basically doesn't change the taste so much. Already got requests to make it again :)
Thanks for posting, busy Co-Unrulie!
Made for ZWT 6 NA*ME for the Unrulies Under The Influence."
305531,427667,10/21/2016,5,Very nice side dish. Thanks for sharing.
628076,442111,3/29/2011,4,"What surprised me most about this cake was that even with all the sugar in it ... it isn't overly sweet. I reduced the butter by half and replaced with applesauce. I also used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose. I added nuts to the center mixture. What was produced was a tasty, dense cake. I will make this again - thanks"
266635,442437,5/14/2011,4,"My pear butter has not quite finished cooking yet; however, my kitchen smells incredible.  I added a little allspice to the ingredient list because I love the flavor of it.  I sampled it a few minutes ago and it is very good.  Can't wait to jar it up and share with my neighbor.  Thanks for the post."
653438,470895,11/6/2012,5,This is such a rich and delicious dish...next time I might try using half-n-half but I made as instructed.  Sent DH out to grill the chicken while I made this and a green salad.  I love this dish.  Thank you for posting this recipe and it is going into my Favorites of 2012.  Made for Fall PAC 2012.
1072593,293474,10/25/2010,5,My way for making up for it being Monday.
822131,232093,4/20/2008,5,"Thanks so much Perfect pixie, I just made this x 4 for 40 people and it turned out great! It was really easy. I needed something satisfying and delicious and able to be expanded easily. Of course it needed a longer cooking time being so much bigger  (I used 2 large roasting pans) but it turned out perfect. I added a handful of rasberries to each one. They loved it! Phew! Will definitely use again!"
1800174616,232093,11/1/2013,5,"We made this tonight, and were very pleased with it.  &lt;br/&gt;We did BUTTER THE BAKING DISH, and are glad we did!&lt;br/&gt;No amount was given, but based on making peach cobblers using cottage pudding as the topping, we used about 3-4 cups of freshly stewed apples, made with brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, and cloves to our taste.  We could have easily used more; the apples lost more volume than baking peaches do.  Next time, and there will be a next time, we&#039;ll use 5-6 cups of apples, which will still easily fit in the BUTTERED 2 quart round casserole dish we used, without running over.  Also next time, I&#039;ll probably pour about 1/3 of the batter over the apples, and stir it in, then pour the rest over that mixture."
159532,232147,5/1/2008,5,"This is exactly how I make mine!  This is so wonderful for desserts.  Thanks so much for posting!
cheri"
330545,232147,6/12/2008,4,Fast and easy!  I used this sauce on store-bought pound cake topped with vanilla ice cream and toasted almonds...yummy...I just need to add a bit sugar but that's just persoanl preference.  Made for ZWT4.
527390,232147,7/30/2008,5,Quick and easy.  I mixed with fresh blueberries and served over homemade vanilla ice cream.  Yummy!
92886,232094,6/14/2007,3,I enjoyed this for a change of pace.  I especially liked the little bits that got brown and a little crisp.  I wasn't overly fond of the taste the rice wine gave it.
258285,232094,7/4/2007,4,Excellent!  I could have eaten the whole lot of it!  My oven doesn't go up as high as 500F so I roasted it at 200C (400F) for a bit longer.  I also used red chillies from a jar instead of Tabasco and didn't even have scallions to put in there.  Didn't even miss them!  Wonderful!
237123,232094,2/26/2008,5,"Delish and so easy to make as well.  Only changes I made was to use just a bit of oil spray instead of the canola oil- in an attempt to cut down on fat; and I also used some hot chili paste instead of hot sauce.  Yum!  I served this over brown rice with baked tofu for a super easy dinner.  Thanks for posting, this is a keeper."
667379,232095,3/17/2008,5,awesome recipe!!! no one mentioned in the reviews about how to handle the wrappers. It took my sister and I a few trys before we figured it out. Bottom line is the slightly floured side is the outside and moisten with wet fingers on the inside--they will stick together much better. It also takes longer to cook the mushrooms--I washed them so there was a bit more of water to cook off.
174096,232095,6/10/2008,4,"Ok so mine did not look as pretty as those from a restaurant, but they tasted good!  I added some chopped sundried tomatoes to the sauce because I really love that flavor with mushroom ravioli.  I also omitted the button mushrooms and added extra portabellas because I had inherited a huge amount of fresh portabellas that I want to use.  Thanks for sharing!"
995157,232095,8/22/2009,4,"Really good! Time-consumiung, but really worth it. I couldn't find shallots, so I used green onions."
136004,232097,1/20/2008,5,"This is wonderful!  Flavors are a nice blend.  Used frozen corn instead of corn on cob.  Cooked chipolte peppers, corn, and red peppers on grill in a grill mate pan.  We love garlic so added 2 tsp and sauteed with pre-pkgd chicken breast cubes and other ingrediants.  Garnish with avocado slices, shredded monterey pepper jack cheese, and a dollop of sour cream.  Yum!  This one's a keeper - thanks!."
1417292,232097,11/22/2011,5,"Very tasty!  I used 5 corn tortillas torn into small pieces instead of the tortilla chips.  The soft corn tortillas dissolve while simmering to make a nicely thickened soup.  This saved some calories and a lot of sodium, which is good because the chicken broth and canned tomatoes add plenty of salt.  Two chipotles made for a very spicy soup so next time I'll go with just one.  Also, frozen corn worked out fine."
102058,232098,9/1/2007,4,"Loved it! DH commented that he liked it a lot too and that he wouldn't mind having this again. I don't have your exact sesoning here in the Netherlands, so used Italian dried herbs mixed with my plain breadcrumbs, and 3 cloves of garlic (minced) in the main dish with more herbs. The cheeses were a mixture of Oud Kaas and Parmegano becuase sadly you won't find a Mexican cheese in a Dutch cheese shop LOL. The combination worked well. Please see my rating system: a lovely 4 stars for a simple but tasty recipe. Thanks!"
1794630,232099,1/17/2011,2,"The cheese didn't really melt that well. But, the combination of ingredients tasted good."
121690,232102,6/19/2007,5,"Well, this is one I totally did not know what to expect, but it turned out to be very good. The only change I'd probably make would be not to bother with adding the reserved cooking liquid, because for me that made it a bit too ""thin""--but that's just my personal taste. Thanks, MathMom, for a novel and interesting addition to my cooking repertoire."
128473,232102,7/19/2007,5,"These were lovely, I couldn't get over the taste and texture, it reminded me of mashed potatoes. I took Echo's advise and didn't use any additional liquid, I found it worked well that way. I loved the addition of the herbs, pecans and sour cream to the dish. Thanks so much for sharing MathMom."
629660,232102,9/8/2008,5,I didn't add the broth back in thanks to the other reviews and the recipe turned out well.
142320,232103,7/14/2007,5,"OMG, I LOVE you!!!!! I have been searching for this recipe for soooooooo many years!!!!! I use to make these years ago and had been told they tasted like New York Deli pickles! I live in Oregon, so that meant a lot! I don't use corriander or peppercorns, but do use a whole cayenne pepper and tons of dill heads. I also always have a problem with leakage so I invert the jars (I use wide mouth quart canning jars) in a glass baking dish and then add some of the brine until it covers over the lid ring and I never had leakage again! I also keep mine out for 10 days! OMG, I am so thrilled to see this recipe again! I wasn't sure of the brine strength, now I have it! THANK YOU!"
175271,232103,7/15/2007,5,"Perfect dill pickles -- very garlicky.  After five days, the brine was getting to be murky, so I drained it, rinsed the ingredients, replaced them in the jar with the pickles and new salt brine and put them in the refrigerator.  I gave them to my dad on father's day, and they didn't even make it home from the party."
569602,232103,8/24/2007,1,"Sorry, I thought these were way too salty. I have made these type of pickles before and never used that much salt, but I tried the recipe anyway and had to throw them all out.  Check out the other recipes for these type of pickles and they use half as much salt."
541474,232103,9/4/2007,1,"After great anticipation, following the recipe exactly, and 7 days of waiting, I was very disappointed to find these pickles inedible.   They smelled great but were way too salty.   Now, it could be that I didn't have enough cucumbers to fill the jar, so I had about 1/3 less cukes than the recipe required, but not sure that this makes a difference?"
688617,232103,2/7/2008,5,The pickles were really good.  I only used about a little over a half cup of kosher salt and they turned out just fine.  I thought using a full cup of salt might make them a little too salty.
851337,232103,6/1/2008,5,"I did not grow up on the East Coast, but I recently had lunch at a deli in LA ""Nate and Als"". We loved the crisp pickles and wanted to duplicate them. Your recipe did it. Easy and Great! But next time I will use a bit less salt."
323555,232103,3/20/2009,4,"Almost exactly what I was looking for!  They're definitely the traditional Jewish pickles i remember from my childhood at Ronnie's Deli in Orlando (which I've been craving for forever!).  The reviews concerning salt confused me - the recipe as I see it posted says 1/4c salt, which is exactly what I used.  I actually think they were a tiny bit bland (I like pickles a little salty), so I'll use 1/3c salt next time, and up my dill and pepper/coriander by a little.  I also might pack the dill/spices in with the pickles rather than put them on top.  I didn't use grape leaves.  I see other recipes calling for the addition of day-stale rye bread, and I might try that next.  All in all, simple, crunchy, delish, and true to tradition.  My family and I are already gobbling them up and reminiscing about the great pickles of days gone by!  Thank you so so much for posting!  This will be a frequently used recipe in my house for sure!"
1514802,232103,1/8/2010,4,"We've tried this recipe only in smaller batches. We altered the ingredient measures to the amount of pickles. Our whole pickles came out great, just a little on the salty side. However we tried some sliced ones and everytime they come out carbonated and they are nearly impossible to eat.... any pointers or tips??"
1606688,232103,4/29/2010,5,Fabulous pickles and soooo easy to make!
1958256,232103,7/16/2011,1,I tried this recipe three different times and followed the directions to the letter.<br/>The pickles are gross and can't be eaten. Any other recipes that work would be greatly appreciates. Thanks!!
1966635,232103,7/25/2011,1,I followed the recipe and it has been a week. Just now tasted them and they taste spoiled. Will not waste my cucumbers on this recipe again.<br/>Sharon from NC
1977422,232103,8/7/2011,5,"I grew up in New York City, where I found ""Batampe"" pickles to be the best, and was able to buy these on the east coast. This recipe worked perfectly, I am thrilled with the pickles which rival my favorite. As a home gardener I am having a bumper crop of pickles this year and and expect to start batch number two and many more. I bought a one gallon jar a Wallmart new with stainless steel top, it can hold about 15 pickles just cut all other ingredients in half, and use of dry dill weed of 1/2 teaspoon works well."
2319608,232103,7/9/2012,0,"Wonderful recipe! I was so happy to find this, I worked for many years in a Jewish deli and these were always my favorite pickles, reminds me of the ones from Carnagie Deli in NYC too. Question though, after the 5 days, I put them in the fridge, they taste wonderful, but brine is cloudy, should I change the brine now?"
31807,232103,8/4/2012,0,"@BitOBar: your brine turned cloudy because your salt had additives in it. It's not unsafe, just unsightly. You can leave it alone. I use pickling salt, which is absolutely pure sodium chloride with no additives, which prevents the brine from getting cloudy."
2374671,232103,8/23/2012,0,"Well, being from Jersey, having worked for years in NYC and frequented many of the Jewish delis, I needed my fix, a good Kosher pickle. In Utah, pickles and pizza aren't like in NYC, not in the slightest. So, I tried this recipe and others. I followed this one to a T - Stop the Clock! These are exactly, repeat exactly, what I remembered and craved. Yes, the liquid turned cloudy but the results were spot on. And, no vinegar; he's right, no vinegar! I don't know how the others who turned up their noses at this recipe got their end product, but I'm going all in, 5 Pickles!"
1803136688,232103,4/11/2015,1,"Did everything precisely as directed,  the jars almost exploded when I opened  them with so much pressure build up.  Can&#039;t believe others have had good luck. The pickles were spoiled and gross. Darn it."
2000982945,232103,7/20/2016,5,Can't wait to try this. Having grown up in Boston I miss REAL pickles
2001113462,232103,8/3/2016,4,"These are very very close to what I do. My mother and grandma used to stand around and whip these babies up in no time. First of all, KOSHER salt is a must! I personally don't care if it's cloudy or not. It changes with every batch. I cram those cukes in there so there is no loose cuke whatsoever. This is a big deal. If you had rotten cukes, one must have gotten loose. Cram the garlic in between. I use pickling spice and a bay leaf, no fuss. Fill the jar with the brine and put the cap on tightly, then loosen it just a tad. Otherwise you can hear the explosions across the street. I have never tightened them. Right now, I have some on the dark side of my counter, fermenting away. I suggest on the second day, open it and see if there is any foam and you can take it off with a teaspoon if you'd like. It should already smell like Katz' deli. Put the cap back, and on the fourth day, tighten the lid, and shake the jar to distribute the liquid evenly. Loosen the lid and tomorrow, try one to see if it's at the taste you like best. Tighten the jar and leave it n the fridge. They'll be gone in two days so get going."
2262555,232103,10/8/2016,5,"If you're looking for AUTHENTIC NY &quot;New&quot; pickles that you'll find in every real deli in NY, you found it.... I used a huge Vlasic Pickle jar I got from Smart &amp; Final. Came home dumped those out and ran the jar and cap through the dishwasher. Took the smell of those things completely away. I made my 1st batch just a few weeks ago in the middle of a SoCal heat wave so I took a few shelves out used my Wine Cave to store the pickles. I didn't use grape leaves and I doubled up on the garlic. BEST PICKLES I'VE EVER HAD, no question..."
2002259965,232103,8/28/2018,0,Can I can these pickles after they have fermented or do they seal themselves in the fermenting process?
107583,412809,5/2/2011,4,"This was easy to prepare and tasted fine.  I cut the recipe in half and baked in a 4-inch casserole with no problems.  I didn't miss having meat in it, as I have made mushroom lasagna before, but I did miss the layers of pasta.  Maybe I will use larger slices of portabellos next time.  Glad I tried it though, since I am trying to cut carbs and gluten due to diabetes.  Thanks for posting."
28442,696,2/13/2002,5,"I love Creme Brulee, and this recipe is awesome. Thanks for posting this, Carole. Fresh raspberries are the perfect accompaniment."

It was a great success, thanks."

305753,232055,6/23/2007,4,"I never liked swiss chard, but my husband LOVES it! I usually indulge him a couple times a year, and make something else for me. I wanted to try something new that I might like too. This recipe is great! I even bought swiss chard by choice today!"
528302,232055,7/16/2007,4,"Very nice, and my 21-month-old loves it, too!"
572341,232055,8/27/2007,5,This subtle little jewel was delicious
542042,232055,8/29/2007,4,I used the red swiss chard which has a slightly sweeter taste than the green one.  The lemon juice really gives it a nice zing.
582563,232055,9/8/2007,4,"this was great, and clearly quite easy to make. i might add a bit more red pepper next time. i'd never cooked swiss chard before, and was amazed by how much it cooks down. i'm going to add this to my thanksgiving repertoire. a nice, simple recipe."
54697,232055,4/6/2008,5,Really good.   I had a lot of chard growing in the garden and this was a tasty and easy way to use some up.
363055,232055,6/26/2008,5,Really enjoyed this...used swiss chard from my garden.
875041,232055,6/27/2008,5,"I sauteed mushrooms in 3 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil before adding the swiss chard.  Lemon, butter and garlic are great with mushrooms  The mushrooms really added a richer look to the rainbow chard I used.  Will add more garlic next time."
53932,232055,7/13/2008,5,I am so glad I have lots of chard in my garden so I can make this recipe again and again.  This really is delicious.  I added more garlic but otherwise made no changes.
1004541,232055,10/27/2008,5,"I really liked this. I changed the recipe a bit - I didn't use any butter, just a good quality olive oil, and only about 1 tablespoon. I doubled the garlic, and also added about 3/4 of a teaspoon of hot pepper flakes (I like my food spicy!). I think using a fresh lemon really added to the flavour. Yum!"
1063828,232055,2/20/2009,5,"I was a little skeptical at first because of the lemon, but it made the dish fantastic. This is especially good with chicken stuffed boursin."
655896,232055,4/30/2009,0,Made this dish.  My husband likes swiss chard.  I find it too bitter.  He loved this dish.  I still don't like swiss chard.
774665,232055,6/28/2009,5,So good. I love swiss chard and wish I could eat it every night. This is a simple recipe that we will use for a long time. Thanks!
442070,232055,7/2/2009,5,Well I made this last year and am just catching up on some reviews... good thing I keep notes!  Well I simply have to make this again!  It was fabulous!!  I really like chard and grow tonnes of it in my garden!  thank you for a nice recipe
31420,232055,8/11/2009,5,I just made this recipe with a nameless leafy green vegetable that I picked up at a street market here in Korea.  I have only one word to describe this recipe: yum!
874900,232055,10/5/2009,5,I bought one bunch for the two of us since we have never tasted swiss chard before.  It was the perfect amount for our first time.  Next time I make it I will use 2 bunches.  The recipe is wonderful and my husband ate it and actually liked it.  Thank you for a great recipe.
1382985,232055,3/9/2010,5,Deliciously simple and healthy.
366914,232055,4/17/2010,5,"Fantastic flavor! We loved this recipe and it was so easy that I could make it on a week night, and will. Thank you!"
256021,232055,5/1/2010,5,fantastic!
427184,232055,6/27/2010,5,Yum! This was delicious.
333017,232055,7/23/2010,5,"Wow!  I usually don't go too crazy about veggies....but this was so good!  The first time I tried Swiss chard, my DH was not too keen about it (I didn't quite get it cooked enough).  This recipe was the deciding factor....like or dislike?!?!  Well, you sold him (and me, of course!!)  The lemon really makes the dish shine through!!  Kudos on a great find and thanks for passing it on!!"
231057,232055,2/28/2011,5,"This was a really easy recipe to use and we liked the flavors.  We haven't decided we are ""cooked"" Swiss Chard fans yet since this was our first time.  I thought it had a flavor cross between broccoli and fresh spinach.  I will try to use Swiss Chard in place of lettuce on sandwiches and wraps and in salads would be good too since it is so healthy, maybe we can work it in our diets like that.  I really like the thick, crispness of the leaves. Thanks for posting a great recipe for us to try!"
461834,232059,6/12/2007,5,"I made this for ZWT3 as I love popcorn!!  This was a nice change from the normal salt and butter, plus healthier!!!  I went lightly with the cumin, but it was enough to change the flavor!!"
1632700,232055,5/24/2011,5,"This is the first year we have grown Chard, so I have been a little unsure how to use it. I have eaten it several times but have never cooked it myself. I looked through all the recipes for Swiss Chard on this site and picked this one. I am sure glad I did. We love it and will be using it a lot from now on. It's simple, easy to remember and the best Chard I have ever eaten. I did add extra garlic, red pepper and I used bottled lemon juice. I was very tasty. Thanks so much for this great recipe."
211577,232055,6/11/2011,5,"Very tasty, I really like the lemon flavor with the chard. I left out the garlic and red pepper flakes,  and added some black pepper instead. Cooking time was pretty much right on, though I think I'll start the chopped up ribs a tiny bit earlier than the rest next time (was good as is, but I think I'd like them just a little softer)"
1187622,232055,6/27/2011,5,"Delicious.   However, I made it with kale.  I do not like to make a recipe for the first time and alter it.  But I do not like swiss chard.  Sorry, I have tried.  So when I read this recipe I knew  kale would be substituted.  This recipe is so good and fast, other than the kale the recipe was made as printed.  The lemon makes it so good.   Thank you hollyfrolly!"
1837312,232055,9/1/2011,0,"Interestingly I wanted to use up an abundance of Romaine.  This recipe worked great.  Though I keep a mix of butter and olive oil in the fridge and used it.  The rest was just about right. It was good.  Tomorrow I do the Chard, as I now have an abundance of it in my garden."
978876,232055,12/6/2011,5,Great recipe that we use whenever we have Swiss Chard in the garden.  Thanks for sharing!
2137570,232055,1/7/2012,5,I wanted to try Swiss Chard for the first time and was looking for a simple recipe. I always considered myself as someone that doesn't like greens....well not anymore! I LOVED this! It was easy and fantastic. Thanks!
1454129,232055,11/26/2012,5,"I just made this recipe tonight since my father-in-law gave us some fresh garden Swiss Chard. I had never had it before. I can say that I don't have enough and I didn't want to share!! It was VERY good. I tasted it before I put the lemon in and loved it, so the addition of my favorite fruit was heavenly!! Thanks HollyFrolly!!"
440324,232055,5/12/2013,5,Oh wow! Thanks to you I just found my new favorite vegetable. Everyone should try this. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe with us.
1689705,232055,10/12/2013,5,"I&#039;m at the point of eating better, esp with vegetable!  I&#039;ve always seen Swiss Chard at the store and not sure how to prepare it.  I saw this recipe and said &quot;Why not?&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;It was easy to prepare and very yummy!&lt;br/&gt;This will be on my green rotation!!"
745868,232055,2/10/2014,5,Simple and delicious!
185926,232055,2/17/2014,5,"Wow!  Simple and delicious.  I&#039;m a chard virgin.  This is my first attempt and we are hooked.  So quick and easy.  I did not add the lemons, but served with sliced lemons and shredded parmisiano on the side.  I squeezed lemon on mine and it was perfect.  Thank you.  This will be made again."
1801304324,232055,7/11/2014,5,I wish I had more chard now.  This was SO good.
1803548589,232055,12/23/2014,5,This is absolutely wonderful! I never really knew how to fix Chard. I never cared for it in a salad. But you will love this!
1803624792,232055,1/7/2015,5,I was doubtful since I&#039;ve never had chard before and am generally not a leafy vegetables lover. I made this recipe last night and loved it so much that I&#039;m going to make it again tonight.
1800038671,232055,7/9/2015,0,So Yummy.  Garden to play in less than 15 minutes.  So delicious and nutritious.  Full of flavor.  We love it!
2000393229,232055,8/9/2015,5,"Switched out lemon for lime and added 6 eggs for a solid meal which was shared by 3.  This clever recipe made Swiss chard accessible, easy to prepare, quick and delicious.  Thanks!"
2001119803,232055,8/8/2016,5,"This was delicious..even my teen son liked it. My hubby called it grass until he tasted it. Said it was very good. Followed the recipe, and added red onions...the red pepper was a nice touch."
2000997000,232055,8/10/2016,5,This is terrific. I added feta and some diced onion and cooked half of these into an omelet for two and it was spectacular!
2001483378,232055,4/11/2017,5,Delicious! Followed recipe exactly and it was fabulous! Also works great with spinach and kale. Thanks for sharing!
330545,232059,6/13/2007,5,So much healthier than butter!  Made for ZWT3
2000554349,232055,7/13/2017,5,"Don't know where I've been all my life but have never cookedcSwiss Chard before! So, found this recipe, followed it and my husband gave it two thumbs up, called his daughter in Texas and said he just ate the best greens he ever had! And he's been to the southern states a bunch! I tweaked it a bit for his taste - some sea salt, a bit more red pepper flakes and didn't cook it quite as long - about six minutes but other than that i used your basic directions. Nice to know I'm not too old to learn new things to cook!"
2001518837,232055,7/15/2017,0,Thank you. It came out very good. I had previously tried to saute chard without the lid and I couldn't get it to soften. The lid makes all the difference.
2000099573,232055,7/30/2017,5,Amazing! we had it for dinner tonight! Doubled the recipe and used leeks instead of garlic and added the zest from the lemon for a little extra pizzazz!
2001721472,232055,9/19/2017,0,I used a finely minced habanero and lemon zest as well as juice. Fantastic!
742029,232055,9/24/2017,5,"This was fantastic! The only 2 things we did differently....we put the stems in the pot for 2 or 3 minutes before the leaves, then we sprinkled with Parmesan cheese after it was plated. It was delicious! Can't wait to make it again!"
1072593,232055,10/5/2017,5,"Eat more swiss chard. Proven to make you score higher on standardized tests. No? No that?? How about: Prevents aging, promotes mutant superhero strength and makes you feel like 16 again? I knew we could agree on something!"
2001682808,232055,1/16/2018,5,loved it ! so easy and so good
2002037367,232055,3/8/2018,0,Went perfectly with my baked salmon. 5 stars.
2001789981,232055,3/20/2018,5,"Gathering from others suggestions, I first saut&eacute;ed mincely chopped up Swiss chard stems in (my idea) chicken broth in a cast iron Dutch oven. I used all of the stems. In addition, crushed garlic (a few cloves) and seasoning were added. When the stems were good and tender (8 minutes) and the broth had reduced, I added the finely chopped leafs along with the butter and olive oil. This simmered for another 6 to 8 minutes. I also added a tablespoon of sugar to offset any bitter flavor. It was done perfectly. I served the greens with a fresh sliced lemon and Parmesan cheese on the side. The lemon juice is unexpectedly a compliment to these greens! Will make again and again."
2001003602,232055,6/29/2018,0,"I have a question: I do not care for red pepper flakes at all...way too spicy for me, sorry. It's a burden, but I can't help it. ANYWAY, what else would you recommend adding or should I just leave it out? Thanks!!"
2002221814,232055,7/18/2018,0,I used garlic scapes....delicious!
54572,232057,10/31/2007,4,"We really liked this. And it was very easy to make, which is very important to me!  Most nights of the week I don't have time to fix anything very complicated or involved.  The only change I made was to leave off the buttered bread crumbs, and to sprinkle just a small amount (apx 1/4 cup) of shredded cheddar on top during the last 10 minutes of baking.  I'll definitely be making this again, after dinner DH said ""This is a keeper.""  That's pretty high praise from  him"
242729,232058,6/25/2007,5,"A superb and very fresh tabbouleh salad - I added a few extra ""greens"" to this and it was delicious! I make Tabbouleh quite often - I have several recipes, but I REALLY liked this one, so thanks for posting! FT:-)"
551629,232058,8/3/2007,3,"I am Lebanese.I agree :This is basically the tabboule recipe,but we usually use more parsely and less tomatoes and depending on the region the bulgur can be soaked or not.I usually use less bulgur than that."
384442,232058,9/6/2007,4,this was the first time I have made tabbouleh and it was great! i added spring onions instead of onions and a cucumber aswell - it was a light and fresh salad!
850821,232058,12/28/2008,5,"This is so fresh and flavorful. I know that you normally use more parsley, but all of the mint makes it super tasty and distinct."
37449,232059,6/10/2007,5,"Healthy, easy, and delicious! If you like cumin, try this! I used Recipe#222425. Thank you Toni! Made for the Middle Eastern cooking tour challenge."
329769,232059,6/11/2007,5,*Reviewed for ZWT June 07* So easy to make and a healthy snack. We regularly have popcorn- the addition of the cumin made it a savoury popcorn. A nice change
169969,232059,6/17/2007,5,"*Delicious*  I really enjoyed this popcorn! This is a great low calorie snack!!!! Zaar World Tour 3
Thanks Toni!"
275207,232059,9/8/2007,4,"It's the simple things that always make the best impression. Stumbled across this recipe looking for something else, but I'm glad I made the detour. I'd never popped my own popcorn before, but now that I've tasted the results, I'll not go back to the microwave version. I used extra virgin olive oil, and the recommended amount of cumin in my trusty dutch oven and I really enjoyed the popcorn. Many thanks for sharing. :)"
199198,232059,12/11/2007,5,Absolutely delicious! The flavor from the olive oil is wonderful. A great healthy snack!
65502,232059,7/6/2009,5,This is unique and delicious! I love popcorn but I never would have thought to use cumin and olive oil! I used Spanish olive oil and about 3/4 teaspoon of cumin. YUMMY! :)
1118667,232059,1/10/2010,5,Delicious! So much flavor without extra fat. Thank you.
331278,261819,4/7/2008,5,"As always, Lainey submits a great recipe! This was very good. The chicken was tender and moist and I loved the white wine and dill. I was liberal with tomatoes, dijon and dill. This is a keeper!
Made for recipe Swap #14"
280271,261819,11/20/2008,5,We really enjoyed this. The chicken is nice and tender and the sauce is to die for. We would have given this a 5+ star but weren't that crazy about the zucchini. If I make this again I will replace the zucchini with sliced mushrooms. Thanks for posting. :)
586291,261819,8/29/2009,5,"Oh man, this was wonderful! I love this recipe. Sooo tasty! I will be making this again and again!"
242766,261819,9/6/2009,5,"Delicious!!  We really enjoyed this moist and tender chicken.  I added some sliced mushrooms to the chicken while it was browning and added a little extra wine and broth.  My husband doesn't care too much for sweet sauces, so he raved about this tangy, savory sauce.  Thank you Lainey for sharing this wonderful recipe...it is definitely a keeper.
*Made for Please Review My Recipe tag*"
324390,261819,2/10/2010,5,Wow! I love this one. I used dried dill weed and cut the amount in half (personal taste). I was a bit wary of using the zucchini because of a previous review but boy am I glad I used it. It really was wonderful in this dish. Next time I'll probably double the amount of zucchini! I would also suggest using only 1/4 to 1/2 cup flour because I had way too much left over. You won't be dissapointed if you make this very tasty dish. Thanks Lainey.
810787,261819,3/1/2010,3,"This was just okay to us. I had really high hopes, but I think it was the dijon mustard that threw the flavor off. I can't say we'll be making this one again. Sorry."
51199,12642,3/13/2004,5,"You're right Lennie, this is delicious. I really hope you don't think that I messed around with your recipe, but after I assembled the ingredients I realised that I didn't have the time for chilling it properly, so instead I combined everything, made it into a roll and chilled it (in the freezer) for an hour - then rolled it in parsley and sliced it thinly on to melba toast. Although it didn't look as pretty as your way, the flavours were great and I think cooking is all about adapting and evolving! Thankyou for posting this."
10113,51509,2/28/2004,5,these are the best my kids love these
120121,86712,3/17/2004,5,"This is one of my favorite recipes from Bon Appetit, too, Lucy.  So simple, but really yummy!  I just wanted to note that this isn't one of those recipes that can be 'lightened' very successfully.  Half-and-half will usually curdle, so it's best to just forget about calories for once and enjoy."
132407,86712,3/22/2004,4,"OK here are my switches and goofs:  I forgot to get shallots, so I left them out.  I used 2 C. heavy whipping cream and 1/2 C. low-fat.  I swapped a red pepper flake seasoning for 1/4 tsp black pepper.  Nonetheless, the process was easy and the result was delicious.  Forget about calorie counting on this one--it's very rich and yummy!"
321999,86712,4/5/2010,5,"Amazing recipe.  Super easy to make, very tasty and a huge hit at Easter dinner.  I made exactly as directed and it couldn't have been better."
2001235230,86712,11/6/2016,5,"This is the only Au Gratin recipe I like, however there is too much rosemary."
222055,201699,3/5/2007,4,These are really good. I really loved the crunch! I took pics but they didn't turn out. Thank you for the different type of peanut butter balls. They were very much worth the try!
367129,289804,4/14/2008,5,This is easy and amazing!!!! giada is a genious!
545825,201699,10/26/2008,5,I first tried these at a church cookie exchange.  They are fantastic.  My kids love them and love to help make them.  Can't beat that with a stick.
228172,210456,4/20/2007,5,This is one of the best recipes I've found on this site. What a delicious way to use tuna! I'm definitely putting this in the regular meal rotation.
516284,210456,6/15/2007,4,"Great recipe for the humble tuna.  Loved the combo of flavors. Will make this again for sure.  I did make a few changes....I used cracker meal instead of the bread.  Came out great!
Thanks!!!"
209266,210456,7/15/2007,5,"yummmy!! I made these tonight and DH and I loved them! I left out the jalapeno peppers and walnuts because I didn't have any, and had to sub regular onions for the green onions and chives. Also, I baked in the oven instead of frying in butter. Used a peach salsa in the sauce and the flavor was great with the tuna cake. thanks!"
126440,210456,11/21/2009,5,We loved these tuna cakes.  Great flavor and easy to do.  I used fresh chives but otherwise followed the recipe.  I may cut the sauce in  half as we had lots left.  I served with coleslaw and was a great meal. We will definitely have this many times in the future.
221855,210456,4/17/2015,5,"What a wonderful thing to do to tuna!  I left out the jalapenos and walnuts (didn&#039;t have any) and was low on cilantro so used half fresh half dried.  Here in Malta, the sauce ingredients aren&#039;t really available, so I improvised with some mayo mixed with Mexican Seasoning (from the States) and it worked nicely.  Even just plain tartar sauce would be fine, since the cakes have so much flavor!  Served with sweet potato fries and mixed veg. for an easy dinner.  Thanks so much!"
51641,211592,3/17/2007,4,"Of the 114 recipes for the RSC#9 contest, I decided to review two and this recipe is one of them. I love Asian cooking, so it really got my interest. I found a container of Red Palm Oil and used it(not sure if the taste would have been different from the Brazilian palm oil).  Anyway, the dish came out perfect; I had halved the recipe and remove the skin on the chicken. It had just the right amount of hot spices (used only 1 tablespoon of garlic, chili paste) and used 1/2 - 1 cup of coconut milk.  Thanks for submitting this tasty recipe!"
353579,211592,3/18/2007,5,"This is delightful!  Really nicely hot and spicy and a great blend of flavors.  I used diced boneless chicken breasts and instead of having corn on the cob as a side dish, I added about 3/4 cup of corn kernels right into the sauce, then served it over rice.  Thanks so much for posting this - it's a winner in my book!"
531029,211592,6/25/2008,5,"Very, very good!  DH loves spice so this was right up his alley!  Couldn't find palm oil annd did not have time to go to a specialty store so left it out.  Would love to know how and if it would have changed the flavor.  But never the less, the dish was delicious without it!
Made for ZWT4."
286566,211592,6/7/2012,5,"Just oh so yum, I used 8 chicken drumsticks (for 3 of us but had 2 left over - the meat for sandwiches) and served with recipe #479907 by Nancy's Pantry but was wishing I had served rice as well to soak up all those lovely sauces but I had to go low carb so not an option tonight but will truly try to make it an option on another night, the sauce is to die for and the chicken was fall of the bone and tender, my drumsticks took 35 minutes on the initial cook with lid on and the 10 with lid off on a slow burble/simmer.  The only change I made was I didn't use the palm oil and as I don't care for coriander/cilantro I use freshly picked parsley from the garden (something recommend by good chef/bad chef Janelle). Thank you Leggy Peggy, made for Aussie/Kiwi Recipe Swap #65 June 2012 and team mate Leggy Peggy."
233491,227979,7/22/2007,5,"This was great.  I used canola oil instead of veggie oil, so I could be sure it was dairy and soy free (allergies)  I made a peanut butter frosting for it, but it would have been wonderful with alone or with a sprinkling of powdered sugar."
315662,227979,1/13/2009,5,Impressive and super easy cake! i doubleld the recipe and baked it in a 13x9 pan. i really liked this cake and will definetly make it again!
237330,248587,10/12/2007,5,"If I could give more than 5 stars, I would give them here! These were fun to make, look really great, and taste fantastic! I used carrots, monterey jack cheese and added very thinly sliced onion. I also used fresh parsley but it fell down into the pepperoni where you don't see it. These olives really look impressive and would be fun for a Halloween theme party with the black and orange. Thank you, Barb!"
560758,248587,12/26/2007,5,I was the talk of the party!! Thanks so much for sharing.
1800063277,255960,9/27/2013,4,I used the angel hair pasta. Added sour cream and black olives! My family loved it.
1072593,202716,12/2/2009,5,"Don't be fooled...as lethal as Bruce Lee.  I give this great revooze.
Made for P-A-R-T-Y Holiday Tag."
593513,248587,1/6/2008,5,I made these the other night when I had company. They were fantastic. They went so quickly I am glad I tried one when I was making them or there would of been none for me to try. I mixed them up using carrots and red bell peppers and Cheddar and Colby Jack cheese. I couldn't find the super colossal size so had to settle for the largest they had. But all worked out wonderful.
60260,248587,1/28/2008,5,"What a great appetizer that is so easy to make and has such great a great visual!  I used carrot, red pepper and jack cheese for the ""filling"" with turkey pepperoni.  People at the party enjoyed them very much!"
774409,248587,5/26/2008,5,"I made these for my 3 year old son's birthday party (party of about 50 people, 10 kids, 40 adults).   EVERYBODY LOVED THEM plus they looked so pretty and fancy, even though they were so easy!!  They were the first appetizer to go.  I used pepperoni, colby jack cheese, red pepper and carrots.  Very cool little appetizers - I will definitely be making these again and again.  Thanks Barb!"
228641,248587,7/18/2008,5,"I was a little concerned about the flavors, but they went over great!!!  Everyone loved them!  I also liked that the olives were cold.  I think it brought the flavor out more.  Made them with lower fat pepperoni and whatever shredded cheese was in the fridge.  Thanks!"
894377,248587,6/7/2009,5,Crowd Pleaser- I think next time I will pipe a little herbed cream cheese into the olive and then add the pepperoni and julienned vegies-Thank you for posting
125388,248587,11/1/2009,4,"Very interesting and unique idea!  I used strips of cheddar cheese, strips of carrot, and long green chives as the fresh herb.  For me the flavor of the olives seemed to overwhelm all the other flavors; I'd like to try this again with slightly smaller olives."
377161,248587,11/13/2009,5,"Fast,Tasty appetizer.Thanks"
6651,248587,2/7/2010,5,"Wow, what a cool idea and so elegant!  No carbs to worry about, and definitely an attention getter that even the most experienced party goer probably hasn't seen.  Very easy to put together and tasty to boot!  I'd give you more than 5 stars if I could."
199652,248587,2/18/2010,5,"How creative of whoever did create these!  They were fun to make, tasted great and looked so cool.  My only complaint is that they are hard to keep standing!  I think maybe next time I will take a little more off to give more of a solid base.  From the fridge to the serving table all the little olives fell over! lol  Everyone was totally impressed with them."
204602,248587,12/30/2010,5,These were amazing. Served them on Christmas Eve as part of a finger foods buffet. Got several great comments on them. They look very sophisticated and pretty as well. We actually added a little dollop of creamy ranch at the bottom of the olive before adding the other ingredients.<br/>A must try for olive lovers out there!
550557,248587,12/30/2014,5,"I loved these. Made with hard salami, muenster cheese and green pepper. Just like eating pizza without the guilt. Thanks for the recipe!"
80998,255960,10/3/2007,5,This is a great dish. Comfort food to the core. I put everything together early in the day and then pulled it out at dinner time to cook it. Followed the recipe exaclty. Next time I will add green pepper or green chiles.  i have to update this review after eating the left overs.  This taste so much better the next day.  I think next time I will make it the day before I serve it.
517198,255960,12/10/2007,5,My family loved this. I omitted the celery as I did not have any on hand and used penne pasta instead of spaghetti and it turned out great.
90086,255960,1/4/2008,5,Excellent!!!
749562,255960,4/10/2008,5,So yummy!!  The ultimate comfort food dish.  We made this on a cold Wisconsin day and everyone in my family came back for seconds and thirds.  Will definetely be coooking this one again.  Thanks for bugging your friend so that we all could enjoy this great dish!!!
144204,255960,4/29/2008,3,Made this for dinner awhile ago. It was o.k. We liked it for the most part. It could have used more spice. It made alot. Will probally make again.
355637,255960,4/7/2009,4,"Very good! It's real thick, and I'm not sure how to get around that, but it's very tasty nonetheless."
1364766,255960,1/12/2010,0,"This is very similar to my Chicken Spaghetti recipe, except I use linguini instead of spaghetti. It holds up better and doesn't get as soft as spaghetti.  I also cook the linguini in chicken broth and use some of the broth in the casserole which keeps it from being so thick."
99624,255960,11/28/2010,5,Perfect!  Wouldn't change a thing.
1615861,255960,8/12/2013,5,"Let me tell you if I could give this more than 5 stars, I would.  This was absolutely delicious.  The only changes I made  were - used 1 pound of ground chicken (awesome choice), reduced butter to 1/4 cup, added 1 diced red pepper and added 1/3 cup milk to make it creamier.  Definitely a keeper......"
1800258472,255960,11/16/2013,5,"This is my new favorite meal to make. Sooo good, and flavorful. I love it!! I make it almost exactly as the recipe except I usually add just a little more chicken (shredded) and I use egg noodles instead of spaghetti. Mmmm."
1764844,255960,4/9/2014,5,Husband thought it was delicious and went back for seconds! I added minced garlic with the onion and celery. Very flavorful dish!
2000072087,255960,3/19/2015,5,"Turned out great. My first attempt at an actual meal and I managed to get it right. This recipe is very helpful, and tastes amazing."
2000299279,255960,6/27/2015,5,Love this recipe just as written.  I have taken it to church potlucks several times and there is never any left over.
2000930903,255960,3/20/2016,5,"Yum! Although I made a couple of adjustments, it came out amazing! I&#039;m picky and do not like &quot;chunky&quot; stuff. So I omitted the veggies, added a lot of garlic-peeper (I love garlic) and liquified the Rotel. DELISH!"
2001401289,255960,2/21/2017,5,"One of the most delicious meals i ave ever eaten. I do add a can of chicken broth, substitute cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom, and omit the olives as well as the mushrooms. Mushrooms are my eat only if I am starving to death food, is all. Sooooo frickin good!!!"
218535,255960,5/20/2018,3,Sauce is too thick and sticky for us
199198,286965,3/2/2008,5,Delicious! Made these potatoes this last weekend for the family. Served with grilled steaks.  I'll be making this again. Thanks!
593159,286965,3/15/2008,5,"Mmmmmm!  These potatoes made the kitchen smell awesome!  One major change that I'd highly recommend, is adding garlic powder.  I also used more butter and cheese than this calls for.  The herbs I used were parsley and chives since that's what I had on hand.  I took the potatoes out of the oven when they were still just a bit firm, which helped them hold together well.  Again, make sure to add the garlic- it makes all the difference!!!  Yum!"
526666,286965,4/7/2010,5,"These are showstoppers! The presentation is outstanding, and I can't wait to 'WOW' my friends with them! I made, as directed, and added a bit of garlic powder (as suggested by another reviewer.) 
The possibilities are endless though, with many combinations of herbs, cheeses and maybe even bacon (yummy bacon :-) ) Thanks so much for sharing, Karen Anne Newton RN. Made for the Spring 2010 PAC.

653438,286965,4/14/2010,5,"Wow!  Made these last night and I did add some fresh garlic in between some of the slices and used fresh parsley, chives and added a little fresh thyme.  Used the cheese you suggested and what a beautiful dish as well as delicious.  Thank you!  Served with recipe#399796#399796, recipe#407195#407195 and recipe#412169#412169 (which we had leftover from lunch)."
174096,286965,5/1/2011,5,"These are very good!  Flavorful and the texture is great!  I used chives and cheddar, and the baking option, and I love how different herbs would easily change these up depending on the menu.  Thanks for sharing!"
437587,286965,4/26/2012,5,"I've been making these for years, and they are delicious. They are definately better in the oven than from the microwave. I always make extra because the left-overs are good too!"
2000386082,286965,4/1/2018,5,Great recipe...added some garlic too. Also substituted 1 tablespoon olive oil for 1 of the tablespoons of butter.
2002173387,286965,6/2/2018,5,Great recipe!
724516,291392,3/18/2010,5,"Mmmm!!! I bought a new waffle machine about a month ago and this was my first waffles I have made with it. I don't know if it was beginners luck but they turned out great, what a nice recipe, I used olive oil and skimmed milk and my chickens eggs.a very healthy recipe. I got eight altogether and I had sour cherry jam with cream on them for supper and the rest I will toast for breakfast. Thank's for a very easy recipe."
2736957,291392,12/28/2013,5,My daughter got a waffle maker for Christmas and we had a blast making these tasty waffles! Very simple and very yummy! Thank you! :)
1252036,316174,9/8/2010,5,Not really sure if this should be 4-5 stars I wish there was 4 1l/2 So very yummy and easy to make. Unfortunately It took me several tries to make as I kept eating the dried apricots and did not have enough to make recipe. Once I finally made I was so glad I got a big package of apricots so I could make this recipe. I only had a little piece as others in my group devoured the cake. That is why I am unsure of the rating. Usually I save 5 stars for exceptional cake. I didn't eat enough to know if it was exceptional or I just like it a lot. though I suppose that is exceptional as I am in regards to food taste hard to please.<br/><br/>I made as is only I greased pan and lined with aluminum foil so Cake would release from pan easily.
280271,428440,6/22/2012,5,This full of spicy yummy flavors...it's easy to prepare and got rave reviews from everyone! Made it for My 3 Chef's tag game...:)
146742,482945,2/21/2014,5,"This was just what I was looking for, an easy basic recipe without ketchup or glazes.&lt;br/&gt;I thought it was very good. Ketchup or glaze mixtures could always be served on the&lt;br/&gt;side for those who want it."
2000726747,482945,12/3/2015,5,thank you! I hate ketchup too
2001357118,482945,1/18/2017,0,Super easy and great recipe! It was a good learning mean for my daughter and myself. We changed it up a bit and added a carrot for color and left out the salt and pepper. The bread crumbs added plenty of flavor.
9869,8587,12/10/2001,5,"These are delicious with a capital 'D'..I have made these to include in my Christmas goody gifts...ahem ahem, I've eaten 3 in a row!
The pastry is melt in your mouth, the filling divine, thank you so much!"
23728,8587,1/8/2002,5,Exactly like mom used to make when we were growing up.  She lost her recipe and was estatic when I surprised her with these.  Really easy and really terrific
13951,8587,1/21/2002,5,"I made these for christmas and everybody loved them. Instead of rolling the dough into balls and pressing them into the muffin tins, I rolled the dough out and used a flower shaped cookie cutter. they looked very nice. I also had to make a triple batch of the filling. I think because my crust was a bit thinnier because of rolling it out. I had well over 80 cookies."
39992,8587,11/19/2006,5,"Great instructions, easy to follow. I had a tough time, but it was ME! The first batch I overcooked, the 2nd batch I let cool to long. But the 3rd batch was perfect! Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's a keeper."
308434,8587,11/26/2006,5,These are absolutely wonderful!  I made them this morning...they are no fuss and quick.  I made them in regular sized muffin tins and got 12 plus an extra large one.  For my oven...I guess it runs hot (will have to check that) so I baked them at 400 for 5 minutes and then reduced the heat to 350 for 7 minutes. They will be made often.  Thanks for sharing!
284771,8587,12/2/2006,4,I've had difficulty with a similar recipe before so I was reluctant to try again. Am I glad I did! These were so easy and came out perfect. Thanks!
351811,8587,12/4/2006,5,"I had lost this recipe. Thank you so much for posting it. My holiday is complete. I remember making these in my tart pan which made the perfect bite size pecan pie. I'm so happy, I'm going to make a batch right now! Thanks again YEA! ~V"
232204,8587,12/22/2007,5,"YUMMY! I make a batch of these every Christmas for my Dad, he's a hard one to buy for and looks forward to the same old tin full of these goodies.  BUT I don't make them pecan pies..I use pumpkin instead. I use the libby's pumpkin pie recipe and fill up the little tarts with pumpkin mix instead of the pecan stuff. LOVE THEM!  Heres a tip, I had to look up--1/3 cup of cream cheese is roughly 4 oz. so you would use half the pkg of crm cheese. Happy baking."
463996,8587,12/3/2008,5,"Just made these today to take to a cookie exchange.  This recipe is yummy!  The cook time was right on, I baked mine about 14 minutes on 400.  The only thing I will do differently next time is be more precise about getting the shells all the way up the sides of the mini muffin pan and not overfilling the shells.  I overfilled a few of mine and they stuck to the pan a little bit.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make this one again."
503477,8587,1/8/2009,5,These are soooo good.  I used a 1 Tbsp ice cream scoop to make the dough balls more evenly and for the filling too.  The filling rises so don't worry that the crust isn't full.
862497,8587,12/12/2009,5,"perfect recipe---I love that crust---want to try it with a savory filling (spinach, water chestnut and artichoke filling) for Xmas eve snacks!  These are easy and beautiful!  Thanks so much Robbie!"
1050639,8587,12/14/2009,5,Very delicious. Mine didn't look very pretty but the taste made up for it. I got a lot of compliments on the crust. I gave credit to the cream cheese- YUM! I will make these again.
1047626,8587,12/30/2009,5,"Wonderful!  I was nervous making these since my mom was coming for lunch and she is a pro at making tassies, but these turned out perfectly.  She loved them."
609933,11502,1/30/2008,5,very easy to make!
771965,8587,1/18/2011,5,I am not good when it comes to making pecan pies :( so when I saw this recipe and how quick it seemed I thought I would make to try it out and oh boy this was goooood.Great taste and loved the texture of the dough once its cooked.So yummy to cover up with whipped topping on top and serving it like that even alone they taste wonderful.
1179225,8587,11/22/2011,4,"Super good, but mine stuck to the pan. The filling bubbled and spilled over. It was hard to get the little guys out of the pan. I know I'll make these again, but I think I'll try using mini paper cups. Thanks for posting!"
749933,8587,11/23/2011,5,I make these every holiday and i have found that if you flatten the balls (Iuse a small rolling pin) then put them gently in the muffin tin they don't stick.  also only fill them 2/3-3/4 full to control spill over.<br/>they never last long in my house.
223367,26939,6/14/2008,5,"Been looking for this recipe for ages...my husband and I love it but I had lost the recipe and didn't know what it was, exactly...so it never tasted quite right. This is perfect...My MinL used to make it every time we were there, kids loved it too. She died...I didn't have the recipe...now I do! Thanks again..Omaelaine"
826700,26939,11/30/2008,5,"I did NOT use the pecans (personal preference), but otherwise I made as instructed.  This was AWESOME!  I made this for a snack for my oldest child's class.  They loved it!!  Thanks for the recipe."
15511,56177,1/3/2004,5,"I made this for an hors d'oeuvre for Christmas dinner.  The color is beautiful.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out wonderful.  I made it a day ahead, and the flavors really blended.  I would caution with the celery salt as the smoked salmon can be pretty salty at the get go.  Maybe add a little celery salt and taste as you go.  Very good stuff.  Made my socks roll!"
241696,156208,12/24/2008,5,"While searching for new Italian dishes this Christmas Eve I came across your Lobster Ravioli, I then took a look at all your recipes and the only thing I can say it WOW!  Your recipes remind me of Sundays at Grandma's.  These clams came out perfect for Dinner tonight!  Thanks for making my X-mas eve even more special!  My family will be in Heavan.  I can see that I will be trying your recipes ALOT!...Thanks again!

113941,166600,6/27/2007,5,"This was WONDERFUL!!!!!!!! Rich and creamy!!!!!!!! And very easy to make, too!!! I will be making this often!!!!! Ty very much Sage!!!!!! :) :) :)"
394203,169148,11/25/2006,5,Loved this easy to do recipe!! My kids think its fantastic!
80353,190496,7/2/2007,5,"Good and simple.  I topped it with a hit of vodka simply because it was late, there was a fool moon, and it tasted great."
422893,190496,6/27/2008,5,A simple & delicious drink that I enjoyed with my lunch today. The addition of the orange juice really cuts the tartness of the cranberry juice beautifully. Made for ZWT 4.
58104,190496,6/30/2008,5,I used cran blueberry! Refreshing nice after working in the garden!
130819,190496,6/30/2008,5,The cranberry and orange make for a great combination. A tall glass and lots of ice - a great summer drink. Made as posted - will be sure to keep those ingredients on hand!
239758,190496,7/1/2008,5,"This is sensational -- a really, really delicious, non-alcoholic drink. Made as written and added a squeeze of lemon juice. So nice. Yummo!"
130663,190496,7/2/2008,5,So refreshing
143917,190496,7/11/2008,4,Thanks Charlotte! Nice to find a easy and tasty non-alcoholic beverage for parties. Our test tasting group gave it a big thumbs up! Made for ZWT 4
201584,202716,6/29/2007,5,"You know your stuff, that's for sure.  Easy, had everything on hand and will make this for myself to use in recipes and then pass along around the holidays.  You're the bomb!  Lolly"
496803,202716,1/9/2009,5,"This was really good!  It only took about 20 minutes for the syrup to reduce to the point of coating a spoon, so this took a lot less time than the recipe noted.  It smells exactly the same as Di Soranno, and tastes really close.  Thanks for posting."
383853,202716,11/22/2009,5,"You have just made my  husband a very happy man.  LOL.  He LOVES Di Saranno, but he hardly ever has it just becuase it's a little pricey, but we don't need to buy it anymore!  We used Skyy Vodka and made as directed.  I simmered it for about 1 1/2 -- not the full 2 hours, but it was perfect.  Thanks so much for posting & sharing this great recipe!  Made for Theirs, Yours, & Mine Photo Tag."
217447,9004,8/17/2010,5,Very tasty way to have tilapia!  I substituted butter for olive oil.  Excellent!
98467,202716,4/27/2010,5,I was skeptical that this would taste as good as the real deal- I was very pleasantly surprised! I did not simmer it on low- I turned the flame up and reduced it in much less time than the time stated and it was absolutely delicious! A keeper.
853136,202716,12/29/2011,5,"made this for my sister for christmas, and EVERYONE in my family LOVES it!!! they say, and i quote, BETTER than di saronno!"
206747,274990,1/22/2008,5,"Did this EGGS-zactly according to the recipe - except used a probe thermometer, which took longer than 20 minutes.  DH and I ate about 1/2 of a nice, thick pork tenderloin, sliced very thin, served with black beans and applesauce.  It was VERY tasty with just enough heat, not to be fiery - but very pleasant.  Thanks for sharing, Duonyte."
280271,274990,1/26/2008,4,We really thought the flavors blended very well together. I had to cook mine longer cuz I had a thick tenderloin. There were no juices in my pan and I didn't see where you were to add liquid prior to putting it in the oven. I had to add some water to keep the pan from burning. Otherwise this was a dish full of great flavor and truly enjoyed. Served it with some roasted red potatoes and recipe #69063. Thanks duonyte for posting.
517900,274990,3/19/2008,5,This was very good and very easy. It had a good mix of spice and sweetness.
481092,274990,5/3/2008,5,I used this recipe for the marinade which was excellent.  I used Recipe #222625 as the method of cooking because it always turns out perfectly for me.  I used chipotle sauce instead of the whole chiles.  I just hand chopped the tomatoes.  This was truly an awesome flavor for tenderloin.  I covered the pan with foil so no clean up either.  :)
82737,274990,9/6/2008,5,This was Excellent to to hot and a wonderful blend of flavors.  Thank you for posting.  I will be making this again.
474322,274990,4/6/2009,5,"These flavors were amazing. I had to add a little water during cooking, but it turned out very juicy. We will be serving this one to company!"
92886,274990,4/26/2009,5,Excellent!  I only made half the rub and that was plenty for a 1.75 lb tenderloin.  I did cook to 150 degrees and it was still pink and juicy in the middle.  Thanks for this.
146284,274990,6/14/2009,5,"Everything about this was great!  I made the mistake of fearing that the rub would be too spicy for my guests, so I removed the seeds from the chipotle before blending with an immersion blender, but next time I will definitely leave them in.  I found that the rub was sufficient for 2 pounds of tenderloin, which I baked from room temperature for 15 minutes on a foil lined sheet, so clean-up was easy.  Thanks so much."
227978,274990,7/8/2009,5,"We really enjoyed this.  The pork was so tender and the sun-dried chipotle rub was very tasty.  This is definitely a ""keeper"" for us.  Thanks duonyte."
980899,274990,1/16/2010,3,"This was good. Used 1 lb pork tenderloin and there was a LOT of rub, which I put all of it on but when eating it was too thick of a coating for me. I like spicy but this was a little too hot, will remove seeds next time from chile"
452355,274990,10/13/2010,5,"We really enjoyed this pork tenderloin recipe!  It was very flavorful!  This does make plenty of rub, way more than is needed for the 1 lb tenderloin.  However, as you suggested I saved the leftover rub and used as a sandwich spread for my chicken sandwich, which was really tasty.  We were out of mayo, so we actually mixed the rub with Greek yogurt, which did the trick and was healthier as well.  I should note that we thought the chopped cilantro really improved the flavor of the final dish and should not be omitted.  I would definitely make this recipe again."
1042494,274990,3/9/2013,5,This was delicious and gave a wonderful flavor to the roast pork tenderloin.  It was the first time I had used the canned chipotle in adobo sauce.  It was much spicier than I had anticipated. Fortunately I tasted it before dumping the whole can in the rub. I ended up only adding about 1/3 of the can.  Definitely tailor the amount to your desired heat level. I also cut a slit in the center of the tenderloin and spread the rub inside the middle of it. I will definitely make this again.
135470,274990,5/16/2013,5,"This was so delicious! It was a nicely spicy without being overwhelming, as has a little sweetness to compliment the savoriness. The only changes I made were browning the roast and using frozen oj. I used more than 3 tbls of rub and still have lots left over. Thanks for sharing, I will definitely make this again. Made for PRMRT"
482376,274990,1/28/2014,5,Excellent pork tenderloin recipe! The pork was perfectly done and very flavorful.  I loved the chipotle rub and am so glad there was extra. I plan on mixing it with mayo to used for chicken/turkey sandwiches. Delicious!
2001438763,392181,6/22/2017,0,This is the second time I made this version. Do not make it if it over 90 degrees outside. It doesn't set right and you have a mess on your hands
197023,282733,8/13/2008,5,"Delicious recipe - great both warm and at room temperature - which I'll certainly make again. I made a few minor changes. For me, garlic is a must in any recipe where it can reasonably be added, so I added 3 cloves of minced garlic to the minced onions (easier to mince in my mini processor than to grate) in step 2. And I added some sage and thyme to the parsley, also in step 2. I initially decided on using only two eggs, and adding another if it seemed necessary. After kneading as instructed, two eggs seemed ideal for a good consistency. The triangular shape was a novel idea, and really neat when using the Koutlets as sandwich fillings - with salad greens - over the next few days: they fitted the bread perfectly! To reduce the fat content, I cooked my Koutlets at a medium heat in the oven on trays loosely covered in foil. They were moist and favoursome: the potatoes were a really nice touch. Next time I make these, I'm going to add some feta - probably just a tablespoon - as I believe this would blend really well with the other flavours and textures. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe, mersaydees!"
60124,282733,7/10/2012,5,"great and easy recipe! I had the lamb mince for a day or two, but I was sick, and hadn't got round to making this. Decided I had to make it, so did the lazy thing; potatoes in the microwave, and everything in the whizz :)<br/>turned out very well!  I did add a little fresh mint to the mix, as I love mint and lamb. Had no trouble shaping the rissoles, and they tasted great! I think they would also be wonderful on a bun with cucumber and yogurt! made for Aussie swap, July 2012"
8629,379876,6/15/2010,3,"If your meatloaf recipe does not include a topping, this one is a good one to use. I made a half recipe and that was plenty to coat the top of my meatloaf."
1399224,392181,9/29/2009,5,"Best copycat of Olive Garden's Black Tie that I've ever tried. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing! I used a little more cake for the bottom layer, only because that's my favorite layer."
1366254,392181,10/1/2009,5,I've never had Olive garden's version but this one was amazing. Perfect for a candlelight dinner I planned for my husband and I
589394,392181,1/8/2010,4,"I made this for a new years party. It got a few compliments, but I personally didn't really enjoy it as much as I'd hoped. Instead of a boxed cake mix I made 1/2 recipe of Sue B's Chocolate Cake --using 2 oz. semi sweet chocolate and 1 Tbsp. cocoa and reducing the oil by a couple Tbsps. and it made a perfect bottom layer (plus no left over cake). I made the other layers exactly as stated. It was very rich and I think it makes WAY too much chocolate ganache...that layer was too thick in my opinion and I didn't even use all of it. I would halve that part if making again."
928171,392181,12/11/2010,5,"This is very good. I made a homemade chocolate cake and put it in two different cheesecake pans. (I figured it's just as easy to make two cakes as one...and I remembered from last year that this goes FAST) (it ran a bit out of one of them, so I put a pan under it as they cooked.) <br/>I forgot the gelatin in step two (but not in step three) and it turned out fine. <br/>This is a delicious (if very time-consuming) cake.<br/>You may want to consider doing steps one and two on one day, and steps three and four the next!"
1787795,392181,1/6/2011,0,"This was so much fun to make, and now i dont have to go out to eat it. It was sooooo good. The only problem is that i have no idea what size pan to use, so mine came out a little short."
1852777,392181,5/2/2011,5,"This cake was a delicous learning experience! I am a very novice baker and ran into a few problems. The bottom layer was a bit too small for my cheesecake pan; the mousse was not as high a volume as the picture; cooked the 1st custard batch too long and it separated and I could not get the first batch of white chocolate chips to melt without burning. Lol!<br/>However, I was finally able to make it, and it is GOOD. I am going to make this again for sure, and next time will use a larger cake pan and hopefully will be able to get the mousse a bit more fluffy."
1903888,392181,5/7/2011,5,I made this for an Easter gathering at my house. This turned out better than I had expected but it was very time consuming (luckily I made it the day before and just kept it in the fridge). I had trouble with the custard layer because I didn't read the directions in advance and had to start that part over. This cake does taste like the original one at Olive Garden. I will definitely make this one again.
2040049,392181,10/21/2011,5,"The best dessert recipe I've tasted.  Time consuming, but easy.  The second time I made it, I doubled the cream cheese and chocolate chips for the second layer and it made it more like a cheesecake layer.  Yum!"
2388124,392181,9/3/2012,2,"this recipe was very confusing and hard to follow.... there are parts missing and u have to figure out what it is telling u to do....mine turned out very good but not at all how it is supose to look....<br/><br/>to the one who put this on her, u need to delete and try again!!!!!"
2002133271,392181,4/28/2018,5,"Outstanding!! I agree with one other review that the moose layer could have been doubled but I’d like to try to increase by 50%. I also want to try making the ganache with dark chocolate instead of semi sweet. But all in all, this recipe is fantastic! Pretty easy too, just takes time!"
622972,46006,9/19/2008,5,"I was having a craving for chocolate, peanut butter and didn't want the hassle of cookies!  These hit the spot.  They were also easy and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  Defiantly a keeper!!"
2476993,392181,11/1/2012,0,"By the way, Olive Garden's Black Tie Mousse Cake is the best dessert I've ever eaten, hands down!  I'm going to bring this to our company's Thanksgiving luncheon.<br/><br/>A ""cheesecake pan"" is actually called a  ""springform"" pan, which is what you always make cheesecakes in and mine is 9"" in diameter.  Also, I always cover the OUTSIDE of my springform pan (bottom of the pan and a little bit up on the sides) with aluminum foil, so there is no leakage while baking.<br/> <br/>Anyway, someone wrote that the recipe was hard to follow, and I think they may be referring to the ""custard"" layer (that's the only part where went ""what?"").  Anyway,  see below what I added to the recipe in ALL CAPS so it makes more sense.  <br/><br/> ""Beat egg yolks until pale. Add sugar, flour, and gelatin, then beat until mixed. Bring cream and vanilla extract to a boil. Add a small amount of cream to egg mixture while stirring. Gradually add ALL OF THE CREAM AND VANILLA EXTRACT MIXTURE TO THE EGG MIXTURE until all of the cream has been added and then pour entire mixture through a strainer into the pan ON THE STOVE THAT CONTAINS THE CREAM AND VANILLA MIXTURE.  THEN, continue to cook until custard begins to thicken. Cool slightly, then pour on top of the chocolate mousse layer and freeze while getting the fourth layer ready.<br/><br/>I hope this helps!"
2022320,392181,1/26/2013,5,"Delicious! But i recommend to make double or even triple batch of 2nd layer, then you will get it to be like an inch high. The amount of products in recipe for second and third layers are not sufficient to make a nice high cake, like on picture."
732723,392181,3/29/2013,5,"The recipe is time and dish intensive, but the cake is delicious.  I have a question regarding the fourth layer.  How much of the 18 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips goes into the cream and butter mixture and how much goes on the side? I ended up melting all the chocolate chips and ended up with way too much icing."
2000241679,392181,6/1/2015,5,"Pretty good recipe, though yes it is labor intensive (but what do you expect from a from-scratch 4 layer cake, lol), so make sure you have a pretty large open window of time.  Have not tasted it yet since I made this as a surprise for my sister and she&#039;s not home yet, but it looks like a winner.  A tip would be to use a whisk when cooking the custard for layer 3.  i used a spoon at first and it started to get a bit chunky as it cooked.  To make the rosettes, i just added some powdered sugar to the left over ganache to make it stiff and frosting-like.  Used mini chocolate chips for the side instead of the usual size.  Made my own recipe chocolate cake (I don&#039;t use box mixes for cake) for the bottom layer."
2000543713,392181,12/31/2015,5,"The steps are easy. Had no problem at all figuring everything out, for an intermediate leveled recipe. Everyone raved! Amazing chocolate cake!"
2001269687,392181,11/25/2016,4,"So, up to the second layer everything worked perfectly fine until I tried the custard layer. Unfortunately, I failed at the custard, but thankfully I substituted with a 4 layer cheesecake recipe (http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/4-layer-cheesecake-recipe.html). I used the Vanilla Cream Cheese Mousse layer found in the food network recipe that I felt resembled the olive garden cheesecake better. As well as, it was much more easier to make. All together this recipe takes a long time to make, but its worth it."
2001320410,392181,12/25/2016,5,"I was really skeptical about this recipe, because the real deal at Olive Garden is SO amazing! But it really worked and it's delicious! I wouldn't suggest doubling the filling measurements as another person recommended I started to do that but saw that it was going to make the cake HUGE, not like the real thing. Next time I make this I will find a super moist cake recipe instead of using the box kind. Then I will bake it like a regular cake and cut it down to what I need. That way I can control the amount of cake a little better then just using half the box recipe. One person commented that they added powdered sugar to their remaining frosting to make a thicker frosting for the roses. Just know that you have to use a LOT of powdered sugar to get it to thicken. I would absolutely make sure you use the entire frosting recipe. It's delicious and makes it easier to coat the cake well on the top and sides."
2002205107,392181,7/2/2018,3,"I attempted to make this cake for my husband’s birthday. I got to the third layer (custard layer). The recipe doesn’t specify what heat to cook the custard on and it curdled miserably. I thought after it chilled it might even out, but it only got chunkier. Threw the whole thing away. The chocolate mousse layer tasted phenomenal, so I’ll try to make it again. Next time I’ll make sure to get plenty of cream in case I need to redo the custard layer. Make sure you cook the custard on the lowest heat on your stove, and don’t let it thicken too long!!"
810785,401050,12/5/2009,5,"Made this bread this morning and will make again.  Very few ingredients, easy to make, I added a cup of pecans and it was so tasty.  Thank you!"
2002305233,401050,10/19/2018,5,"Wow I thought this recipe was a bit of a long shot considering it's fat free and egg free but I thought the result was great! I will definitely make this again :) (Also, I used 60g stevia instead of sugar and omitted the cinnamon, personally I would add a lil more stevia next time)."
296809,445992,7/22/2012,5,"Made as written for ZWT-8 & a fellow Chef Gone Wild, I knew these potatoes were not something I would make for our routine day-to-day dining. BUT I wanted a new & spec potato dish I could proudly serve to guests. These potatoes are special - rich, flavorful & definitely company-worthy. They should be the star of a meal & not be served when another sauce is a part of the menu. Meat from the grill seems like the ideal pairing. Oven temp & cook time were spot-on, but I would suggest tenting the top of the baking dish w/foil for the 1st 20 min (or so) of the cook time. Mine were a tad dark on top in spots. Thx for sharing this great recipe w/us. :-)"
67728,445992,7/26/2012,5,"Luxurious and delicious! I agree with twissis, these are not an everyday side dish, but they are definitely worth the occasional splurge! I had found some nice rock lobster tails at Costco, so I grilled those up to serve with these potatoes. I used some tiny yukon gold potatoes, so I quartered them lengthwise to get tiny wedges. I didn't have a problem with the tops getting too dark, but maybe it's because my potatoes were so tiny that they started off covered in the cream mixture. Edited to add: I almost forgot, I used fresh parsley in place of the flakes because I had so much on hand. Thanks for posting! Made by a Honey for ZWT8 France"
1742738,445992,6/5/2014,5,Really great recipe.  I added 8 oz of fresh sliced mushrooms.  Klondike golden small potatoes worked really well for this.
39835,449633,3/7/2014,4,"Very good salad - this makes a lot! I did want to increase everything a bit for two people and also to use what I had on hand. I used a microwaveable rice (brown rice) for two people, some cabbage instead of the greens, a zucchini instead of the cucumber, 1 tomato cut up instead of the cherry tomatoes and the rest of the recipe as printed. The can of tuna I used was a 5 oz can of tuna and I added 1 hard-boiled egg which I wanted to use. These changes were a bit different than the ingredients posted but I think the salad remained about the same - just a lot more of it and we served the salad with crackers. This will also make a great lunch tomorrow - thanks for sharing this recipe which I will make again using closer to the original posted ingredients."
68524,4699,1/19/2003,5,"My mom makes this at Christmas minus the fruit, raisins and nuts and I love it. This is a wonderful dish. "
96806,4699,12/30/2004,4,Excellent pudding with an aromatic and spicy flavour.  I'll increase the amount of candied peel and raisins the next time as we all like it loaded with dried fruits.  
32772,34090,4/10/2003,5,Wow!! This was fantastic. A very easy recipe and nice to serve with homemade bread right from the oven.
8688,34090,4/11/2003,5,"Another winner, Nez!  I've been making this for years, but never actually had a recipe for it.  Now I do!  Thanks for posting it!"
402279,34090,1/6/2007,5,"Yum! DH doesn't eat sugar but he loves honey! This pleased him very much! I made cinnamon buns with this instead of the standard brown sugar mixture and they were outstanding and best of all, he could enjoy them too! Loved on toast in the morning, too! Thanks so much!"
19683,46006,3/2/2003,5,"These were very very good.  Reminded me of what they served at school when I was much younger.
These were moist, tasty and lasted well.
Well done."
247452,46006,5/15/2007,5,"These were very easy to throw together, and SO yummy!  A moist and tender, easily portable bar with just the right combo of peanut butter flavor and chocolatey goodness!  Thanks so much!"
398275,46006,10/14/2008,4,"These are very tasty bars but I had 2 problems with the recipe.  First, the directions don't mention where to add the peanut butter so I added it with the butter, sugar and eggs.  Second, even after baking the bars for 35 minutes, they were still very gooey.  They did set up a bit overnight but I'm wondering if a little more flour might help.  All in all, these bars were enjoyed by the group I shared them with and I will be making this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing!"
1323332,46006,7/13/2009,5,It was really good!  I only changed the flour to 2 cups because I thought the dough wasn't thick as a bar dough recipe.
88378,46006,7/14/2009,5,"Heavenly.  I took cookingqueen80's advice and upped the flour to 2 c.  I also used a little less sugar and one less egg.  The result is a scrumptious bar, moist, rich, buttery and all around perfect.  I didn't add nuts; they'd be great but these are really rich bars without them.  Thanks for this winner!"
146310,72689,11/17/2004,5,These are very good. Sweet and rich without being too much of either. Just right. 
232480,72689,12/28/2005,4,"These were good.  Not great, but good."
171525,72689,4/15/2006,4,"Very tasty and good for my sweet tooth, however I found that the mixture was very lumpy. Maybe next time I will sift the flour instead of pouring it straight in."
422458,72689,2/24/2007,4,"i sifted the flour (used whole wheat flour). i did not have vanilla instead i added one brown mashed banana and cooked for 24 minutes. it was great, my 16 month-old son and husband liked it so much. 12 muffins finished in one day!. thanks."
477411,72689,10/14/2007,4,"These were great, I added whole wheat flour and a banana that I needed to get rid of. I made large muffins, since theres only two of us I froze most of them, but will look forward to warming those up for breakfast during the work week. Thanks for posting Miss Diggy."
354675,72805,3/19/2007,5,"I LOVE this recipe and the Silver Palate!  It is v. easy and so great to make ahead.  We like you use bone-in chx breasts or thighs to ensure juicy meat.  The combo might sound weird, but the caramelized prunes, olives, and chicken are simply scrumptious. Thanks so much for posting!"
598136,72805,1/16/2008,5,"I've made this since Silver Palate was published and it's still a favorite with my family. Don't worry, no one will ever know there's prunes in it unless you tell them!~"
180765,100104,12/15/2004,5,this are the best thing i have ever put into my mouth...i love them...if i were italian i would get married every year just to have these made at my wedding...last time i went to an italian wedding i took some home in my purse...YUMMMMMMY!!
129652,100104,2/4/2007,5,"Only make these for VERY special occasions.  It took me about 3 hours to make these.  I'm still not sure I'd make them again because of how much work they are to make.  I took them to a pot luck, and they were all eaten.  Everyone commented that they looked and tasted like they took a long time to prepare.  Well, they did.  Also, most people only ate half the cookie and shared the other half with someone else.  They're rich, pretty and unusual but not the kind of dessert you want to keep popping into your mouth. Oh, and mine did not look like peaches, but they still looked good.  Here are a few tips if you attempt this recipe: 1) Start scooping out the cookies as soon as they come out of the oven, and work very fast.  When the cookies cooled, they became crumbliy and would break apart. 2) After scooping out the insides, lay the cookies upside down with the hole facing up in a line.  That way they'll be ready for the assembly line filling.  3) I put the preserves (I used about 1 cup of preserves) into a ziplock bag and snip off the end.  Then squirt the preserves into each hole.  4)I used peach schnapps instead of the brandy, and I used a bit over 1/2 cup.  5) Use small amounts of sugar for the rolling because it gets moist and sticky really quickly, so I kept having to toss it out and refill the bowl."
66899,100104,10/28/2007,5,these are worth the effort!  i made these for my son's class so i brushed them with peach juice with a bit of food colouring instead of the brandy.  i also filled them with custard instead of preserves.  i made the cookies and filled them with custard and let them sit in the fridge overnight.  the next morning i brushed them and rolled them.  they tasted the best the next day.  they looked amazing and the kids were so excited to eat them!  thanks for a great traditional recipe!
51482,100104,12/18/2007,4,I too have this recipe but I bruch mine with eggs whites and roll the cookies in a package of peach and organe jello. Then let them dry.
839248,100104,5/13/2008,5,"I have been looking everywhere for this recipe.  I just happened to stumble across it.  Both my parents were from Calabria and growing up I remember having these at all the weddings we would go to.  

I made them for my daughter's communion and they were absolutely amazing, so easy to make.  I actually filled them with a custard filling and everybody was fighting for these cookies to take home.

Once again, thank you so much for posting this."
101432,100104,5/14/2008,5,"I coaxed this recipe out of my sister-in-laws mom - she had made them for their wedding.  I've since made them for a few weddings and a couple wedding showers and anniversaries, too. What I've learned:use a small cookie scoop to form the ball - then divide the balls in half - this makes a nicer sized cookie in the end; use a pointed serrated grapefruit spoon to scoop out the warm centers; use a commercially prepared pastry cream and they will hold in the fridge for 3 days (don't dip and sugar them till a day before serving); use royal icing for the glue to put the two halves together (though I LOVE the idea of dark chocolate ""glue""!); tint the remaining royal icing green and pipe leaves on the finished cookies' tops; use a pastry brush to moisten the peaches - they won't get too soggy that way; change the sugar often, it does get clumpy after a few cookies; place the cookies in white candy papers, they deserve this presentation; for transporting, these fit perfectly in Styrofoam egg cartons - I've even mailed them packed like this and only a few icing leaves were dislodged!  These are wonderful! Thanks for posting the recipe so I don't lose it again!"
890029,100104,7/13/2008,3,"The brandy was really overpowering in this recipe!  I made several of these cookies dipping them in the brandy before I tasted them.  After I tasted one, I threw them all out!!!  It was entirely too strong.  Instead, I bought red food mist coloring that you can spray on lightly and then rolled the cookies in powdered sugar.  This seemed like a nice solution.  Thanks for the recipe though, they're very attractive!"
628779,100104,7/14/2008,5,I have made these many times and get great reviews all the time. They have just the right balance of flavor with the barandy and pastry cream that I use when I make them.
371738,100104,10/25/2010,5,"We make these in Yugoslavia/Serbia, too.  We call them Breskvice (""little peaches"").  Thanks for the recipe.  I had misplaced mine."
1640859,100104,1/6/2011,5,"I absolutely love these cookies, they are such a beautiful presentation. There  is actually a slightly different version of this recipe, its from Austria. Instead of filling the cookies with peach preserves you make a chocolate cream filling, with walnuts, cookie crumbs, and peach brandy. I like this version better only because I%u2019m not a fan of peach preserves. There a big hit at my family functions, I always make these beautiful cookies for Easter.  LOVE THEM :)"
258606,121880,12/20/2009,5,"This is surprisingly delicious!  A subtly sophisticated flavor in a kid-friendly presentation.  We served this at my daughter's Spooky Sleepover Bday Party, and it was the perfect thing to warm them up after ghost stories around the firepit!  I didn't find ghost marshmallows, but I did find Halloween shaped marshmallows which included pumpkins, bats, crescent moons, and ghosts.  I preferred the pumpkins, bats, and moons, because they were colorful against the white hot chocolate and the white whipped cream (in a black mug for Halloween!)  I will definitely make this again - just for me!

66448,151223,10/11/2006,5,"Made this tonight for dinner, I thought it was very good for a different kind of salad. I love any kind of salad that has mandarin oranges & nuts in it!"
101823,151223,10/14/2006,5,"Awesome salad dressing!  I urge those who don't care for mandarin oranges or pecan to try this dressing on other salads.  It is fabulous.  I, personally, loved the contrast of flavors of the salad as posted and will make this again and again."
109110,151223,4/23/2007,5,I make this for company.  The dressing is a lovely pink.
616211,151223,12/24/2007,5,Toasting the pecans makes all the difference!  This salad is definitely a keeper.  Make sure to toss with the lettuce RIGHT before serving.  You don't want a salad this good to get soggy!
1641892,151223,8/2/2010,5,"This is an excellent salad.  Very summery and refreshing.  I used olive oil, and white wine vinegar because I had them on hand.  I wish I hadn't put the whole batch of dressing in at once, it was a little heavy on the (delicious) dressing.  Next time I will start with half and see if I need more."
146284,151223,9/26/2010,5,"Such a simple salad, but so pretty, and so tasty. The dressing made twice as much as I needed, but all to the good because we will glady have this salad again today. I used white balsamic vinegar, which is fairly sweet, so I reduced the sugar by half (actually, I used 3 packages of Equal), and it was perfect for us."
68460,175216,9/10/2006,5,"I made this on Labor Day...I used a bone-in, pork loin roast.  After combining the seasonings, I rubbed them into the roast, wrapped it in Saran wrap and let it sit in the fridge all day.  I took it out and let it sit for an hour and then proceeded with step #3, except that I left the burners lit (gas grill) under the pork for the first half hour, which seared it really well, then I turned those two burners off and did the rest by indirect heat with the remaining two burners.  My 4 pound roast was perfect after 2 hours of grilling....slightly crispy on the outside and tender and juicy within.  I never thought of putting poultry seasoning on a pork roast and we really enjoyed the flavor of it.  Thanks for this great, simple recipe Carolinafan!"
44383,175216,5/6/2007,5,I made this today exactly how it was detailed except I used a 6lb boneless pork roast.  It was still ready in exactly 1 3/4 hours and it tasted tender and wonderful.  We'll be using the cold meat for sandwiches tomorrow.  Very simple but tasty way to serve a pork roast.  We just had salad on the side and it was a very nice meal.  Thanks.
246145,175216,3/19/2008,5,"What a wonderful recipe! It tasted great and was easy to make. I put it on the grill and just left it for an hour and 45 minutes. When I pulled it off it looked a bit crispy, but it was juicy and delicious. I am making this again tonight and hope it will taste as great as it did the first time! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!"
315680,175216,9/6/2009,5,"It's just a shame you can't give this recipe more than 5 stars because it certainly deserves it.  The combination of the poultry seasoning and chili powder on the pork roast was absolutely amazing!  I would have never guessed how well they would enhance the roast.  Thanks for posting the recipe, our dinner guests thank you as well."
987504,175216,5/26/2013,5,Very good!  So easy to make too. The rub is awesome.  I plan on using it on chicken too.  Thank you for sharing.
67103,207158,4/28/2007,5,This banana bread is awesome--so nice and moist.  It was very quick to put together too.  I added the optional chopped nuts and am glad that I did.  This bread also has a great banana flavor!  I made this into four mini-loaves.  Thanks for a great recipe. :-)
415212,207158,7/21/2007,5,I made this today and it turned out good. I threw in chocolate chips which gave it a different flavor. Turned out perfect.
88099,211546,2/4/2010,5,This is an excellent recipe. The flavor combination worked well for us. I couldn't get a whole chicken so I used legs and thighs. I also didn't use the toaster oven broiler step since I thought it was nice and brown when I took it out of the oven. The chicken was very moist and tender. Loved the blue cheese and hot sauce dip and IMHO is a must with this recipe. Presentation was cute too. You did an excellent job coming up with this one. UPDATE: I'm updating this review to post Sy's photo since he is not able to at this time. I can see why too. Mine did not capture the recipe correctly the way he intended so I'm so glad to be able to post this for him. Truly a great recipe that you should try.
69260,216100,1/25/2008,5,"I made this with 2 cans of regular diced tomatoes, and used only 4 oz of smoked cheddar with 4oz of velveeta. I was afraid a full 8 OZ of smoked cheddar would overwhelm the dish. This was a really good mac 'n cheese with a nice smokey flavor. I'll use it again."
452940,234424,3/18/2008,4,"This is a great recipe for roasted chicken. I used a melted butter/olive oil mix, and added the spices called for to it, adding fresh and rubbed sage for personal preference. Using a pastry brush, I brushed the outside of the chicken generously and used my fingers to get the seasoning under the skin of the bird. Step #6 was optional and so left it out. Step #9 I chose option #2 as this is how we do it here traditionally. This recipe is very well written with lots of detailed instruction for the beginner cook and experienced cooks will thank you for the great flavor your spice blend offers."
197023,234424,4/18/2009,5,"momaphet recommended serving this chicken with mashed potatoes to mop up the gravy so, although I've never been a huge fan of gravy and had to hunt out a recipe, that's what I did and I really think I might now I'll be making gravy more often. ;) We greatly enjoyed this flavoursome and moist chicken with Recipe #169957 and my Recipe #159516. As for the chicken itself, I loved the use of herbs and did add two more: oregano and sage. A great combination which really gave the chicken a wonderful flavour. I used fresh garlic which (as I usually do!) I doubled and minced and mixed in with the herbs. I used the olive oil and in step nine went with option #1. We SO enjoyed this for dinner several nights ago and what we didn't eat then, we thoroughly enjoyed with baby spinach leaves in the most delicious chicken sandwiches. YUM! A basic recipe yes, but for Zaar chefs so spoiled for choice, it's all too easy easy to neglect the basic recipes. Thank you so much, momaphet, for sharing this delightfully yummy basic recipe! Made for PRMR."
1155210,234424,5/28/2009,5,Loved the flavors. I added some fresh lavender leaves and also some fresh sage. Turned out wonderful the only thing I would change next time is the oven temp. For my oven it was a little too hot. I served it with fried potatoes and Recipe#240824. Made for ZWT5 Thanks for this delicious recipe!
463202,234424,5/29/2009,4,"Great chicken, great recipe. For the most part I kept with the recipe.  I didn't make gravy with the giblets, because I'm not fond of giblet gravy.  I used the olive oil to rub into the skin, and I don't think I would consider it optional! I used garlic powder, dried thyme from the garden and fresh rosemary from the garden.  My only complaint was that my chicken cooked in about an hour, an hour before I had the rest of dinner ready to go! LOL  So my chicken got a nice long rest under some foil, thank goodness for thermometers.  After I started slicing the breast meat, I snitched the piece coated in all the yummy herbs for myself. :)  Nummy, and so was the thigh meat, as promised.  Thank you so much for sharing, hon!  Made for ZWT5, for the Groovy GastroGnomes."
423539,234424,6/2/2009,5,"What a yummy recipe for chicken. Mine came out moist and tender and the flavor from the herbs was just delicious.
I did lower the oven temp to 400 but made as written.
Thank you for posting. Made for the Dining Daredevils Team for ZWT5."
962690,234424,9/9/2009,5,"I used all fresh herbs since I was out of the dried.
YUMMMMMMMYYYY.
I did not make a gravy.
This will be made again and again
Made for PAC Fall 2009."
212609,234424,11/3/2010,5,"An easy five stars for this recipe..wonderfully simple and SOOOO delicious.<br/>I used garlic powder,dried thyme and fresh rosemary and the flavours were fantastic!!<br/>The chicken was moist and juicy, and the skin so crisp and more than a little addictive (nobody else got a look in-cooks perk I guess!!).<br/>I served this with roasted veggies,potatoes and gravy and the entire family demolished it with gusto. I even cooked another one a few days later,which we stuffed straight from the oven into some wholemeal pitta breads with some salad leaves,tomato and mayo-heavenly!!<br/>This is a GREAT chicken recipe-I am so glad that I found it....thanks momaphet x<br/>Made for PRMR.<br/>Th"
369715,234424,11/3/2010,5,Very good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written. We all enjoyed this.
17803,234424,6/18/2011,5,"I made this tonight using my Ronco compact rotisserie.  The chicken I had weighed 4.5 pounds and only took 1 hour 20 minutes in the rotisserie.  My dinner guest enjoyed the combination of herbs and spices used.  Between the 6 of us, we licked the platter clean!   Since I used a different method to cook the chicken, I did not have any drippings to make a gravy.  Made for ZWT - Switzerland"
80353,234424,6/21/2011,5,Roast chicken always gets applause here - this version was very good and much-enjoyed.
280271,234424,10/2/2011,5,Delicious! Delicious! The meat was so moist and packed full of yummy goodness...I used all dried spices with the exception of the garlic...I omitted the olive oil but the skin still came out nice and crispy...what a keeper...thanks for posting. :) Happy I have leftovers for up coming goodness...I decided to keep the dripping for our DOGS...they were doing the happy dance at dinner time...Thanks for posting...:)
482376,234424,7/26/2012,0,"I made this recipe and changed it only slightly to cook it in my crockpot. It was fabulous. I really loved the spice blends, making the chicken full of flavor. Your directions were perfect. I love the suggestion for gravy, although I didn't make it this time. My whole family loved this moist and flavorful roast chicken. Made for France - ZWT8 A French Love Affair Challenge. Merci!"
226863,234424,7/29/2012,5,"I changed this up a bit...used the ingredients listed, but also added some herbes de provence mixed with butter.  Spread this under the skin and tossed some sliced potatoes and garlic  under the roasting rack to absorb the drippings from the chicken.  This was amazing.  I'll butterfly the chicken next time to cut the cooking time, and also spread the wonderful drippings all over the roasting pan and potatoes.  Delicious Sunday dinner for us.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for ZWT."
502302,234424,1/18/2013,5,As you said this is a great basic recipe. I had company coming and actually roasted 2 birds since I also rely on the leftovers. The drippings made a great gravy and I plan on boiling down the carcasses and expect a flavorful stock as well. I think it took longer than expected but I had the birds side-by-side so that may have been the reason. (Chickens alway seem to take forever to roast for me!) This was the first time I really used the technique of rubbing the seasonings under the skin. I think it is worth it... especially since I would like to avoid the extra calories of the skin. I used the larger amount of spices but made it stretch for the two birds. I used option 1 of flipping the birds over. My MIL always swore by cooking the bird breast-down but then you don't get the crispy skin so I think this is a great compromise.
314327,263877,1/26/2014,4,Very flavorful! Only for garlic lovers!
804550,287708,9/12/2009,5,"WOW! This is delicious but very rich!
I drizzled chocolate syrup on top of the cool whip. Both my DH and I both would have loved to have a tall glass of milk with this pie slice. LOL! However, we didn't have any milk. Made for PAC Fall 2009."
732425,287708,9/29/2011,5,"This tasted good just making it! For those allergic to dairy, here are the subs:<br/><br/>Tofutti non dairy cream cheese (plain)<br/>Rich Whip whipping cream (8 oz. carton, available in most freezer sections)<br/><br/>It turned out great and there was no taste difference that my friends could discern. Easy to make and highly recommended. <br/><br/>It should be noted, as I didn't see it in the recipe, that this has to be kept in the refrigerator."
311003,310373,8/1/2009,4,This is a great and easy-to-make dinner meal.  For my personal preference I used only 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning.  The sauce came out really tasty and had a nice tang from the worcestershire sauce.  Next time I'm going to add a little tomato puree for a brighter color and I think a sprinkling of shaved parmesan cheese on top of each serving would add a nice flavor to this already delicious dish.  Thanks for posting!
424680,310373,2/22/2010,5,"Made only 2 small & insignificant changes when preparing this ~ I used red bell peppers instead of the green, & I substituted lemon pepper for the usual S&P! What a great way to serve up pork chops! This recipe is certainly a keeper ~ Thanks for sharing it! [TEagged & made in Please Review My Recipe]"
868729,317011,8/18/2008,5,I had my mom make this because it sounded so good to me.  It was amazing!  The flavors of the nuts and cream cheese and and the topping just put it over the top for all of us!  Thank you so much for this terrific cake recipe Nana!  It's now  going to be my annual birthday cake :)  Dang was it good!
594139,317011,9/13/2008,5,"Excellent sums it up in one word. I love cheesecake and I have a few recipes that are my favourites to make and this one goes straight in there. The flavour was awesome the strawberry glaze yummo. I made 2 cheesecakes to take into work on Friday and they went down a treat, lucky for me I still had half a cheesecake left so I took it home for hubby and son, well and perhaps I had another slice. So I will be in the gym for the next month to burn this off but it was just Sooooo good. A great post happynana!!"
592633,317011,12/26/2008,5,"My mom made this for dessert on Christmas day, as I was making lots of other things.  This is amazing cheesecake!!!  We waited until later in the afternoon to cut into it so everyone could digest from dinner and really enjoy it, and let me tell you, It was loved and eaten right up in no time flat!  Beautiful presentation, and good enough to adorn any table, any time!!!"
537188,317011,6/14/2009,5,This was a wonderful cheesecake! I halved the topping and didn't make as much glaze. We had half the day I made it and half the day after - both days it was equally as good despite being very different! Thanks!
804931,317011,9/8/2009,5,So pretty and so delicious!  DH and I brought this to a party at my sister in laws house and it was very well received.  There wasn't a crumb left on the plate when I went to pick up the plate!
632552,322236,9/19/2008,4,"quite good.  The batter seemed a bit thin, and I worried that I might have missed a cup of flour, but it turned out fine.  The instructions at step 5 refer to adding lemon zest not included in the bread ingrediants (so I just added a teaspoon of zest here, too)."
727055,322236,9/24/2008,5,"Wonderful! Used frozen blueberries and since I didn't have a lemon for zest, I used 1/2 TBS lemon juice and a pinch of orange zest. It did take a bit longer to bake (maybe from the frozen berries?) about 65 minutes. Made for Fall PAC '08. Thanks for dessert!"
130663,322236,10/12/2008,5,Very moist and delicious.I will make again
879350,322236,8/8/2009,5,"Wish I could give this more than 5 stars! Not only did it taste great, the house smelled fantastic while it was baking.
I was a bit concerned that the batter was so thick, but no worries it turned out fine.
Thanks for sharing!"
424680,351711,3/12/2009,5,"Made this one without the use of an ice cream maker ~ A little more prep time, but easy enough! ABSOLUTELY GREAT TASTING! Didn't have to worry about it freezing too hard, 'cause after I got it to the right consistency I opened my doors to the neighbors & it was all gone before it had a chance to melt! Definitely a keeper rercipe! [Tagged, made & reviewed in New Kids on the Block]"
462997,406765,12/9/2016,3,"I recently bought a bread machine. This is my 3rd time. I'm trying a recipe for each setting. I found this one allowed me to use the quick cycle. My results turned out a very dense, yet moist small loaf. I used 2 c. of reg white flour &amp; 1 c. of bread flour &amp; instant yeast. Also a bit sweet...but since I deviated from the recipe I can't rule it out. Reminded me of hard rolls, great for sopping up a nice bowl of soup or stew or spaghetti. I'll hold on to this recipe and shape into rolls next time. Thanks for sharing."
765539,445046,3/24/2012,5,"I know this is more of a technique than a recipe, and I bet lots of people are familiar with it already, but WOW!  I have never seen my brood tear through carrots like they just tore through these tonight.  They were absolutely perfect:  naturally sweet, tender without being mushy, and the simple seasoning really worked.  The tip about ""chuffing"" the potatoes was key - lots of yummy crunchy bits!  I had gotten a bunch of multicolored carrots, and this has to be the most beautiful way possible to prepare them.  I wish I'd gotten a picture, but it was gone too quickly!  I'll be making this again, no question."
1801722224,446663,12/2/2017,4,"Very good chili! I used a tablespoon of Penzry's chili powder and substituted a bunch of chopped mixed grape tomatoes for the can of diced tomatoes, and used a frozen package of corn and two frozen packages of butternut squash cubes. I skipped the slow cooker and just followed the stovetop directions. Served it with shredded cheddar, sour cream, and tortilla chips. Our guests loved it. Next time I make it I will cut the water to one cup, as we prefer a thicker chili."
125356,461207,8/9/2011,4,Very tasty. I made it with mashed potatoes. We eat lots of bread with the juice.
599450,461207,11/5/2011,5,"Delicious! Great flavors! Love capers! Made as directed. Thanks, IngridH! I will make this again and again. Made the first time for PRMR tag game."
2197365,461207,3/30/2013,5,"This dish was awesome! I am not an experiences fish cooker, but this was easy, fast and delicious! My husband said it was his favorite!  Served it with brown rice.....the sauce was great with it as well."
2810482,461207,5/2/2013,1,"All the right ingredients were there, but the finished product is not something I will attempt again."
2000431901,461207,6/20/2017,2,The flavor wasn't quite there. Thinking maybe it needed some garlic powder seasoning the fish with the salt and pepper.
2000693086,461207,3/12/2018,5,"I don’t have a photo but it looked fine. I loved the sauce! I think I might want to try it a bit sweeter next time. The thing I don’t understand is that the dish had a definite and for me unpleasant bitterness to it. I don’t think it was the sauce, and I know my olive oil is okay so I think it must have been the fish. I haven’t cooked rockfish before - I just saw it at Costco and thought “oh that might be fun to try!”. Is there something weird about rockfish?"
2002205149,461207,7/2/2018,5,The sauce was amazing! I used a dry white wine and the capers and lemon added just the right amount of spice to elevate a bland fish. My local market provides very fresh fish which is also a key to the success of this recipe. I am going to try this sauce recipe with crab and chicken as well.
2002303484,461207,10/16/2018,5,"My husband isn't a fan of fish, particularly strong-tasting ones. When rockfish was on sale at our Whole Foods, I decided to give it a try, thinking I would cook it pan fried with a piccata sauce. Voila, this showed up when I went Googling, exactly what I wanted! It was as easy and delicious as all the prior reviewers said, and my husband said it was good."
32781,8852,3/4/2002,5,The recipe looked elaborate but came out relatively easy and was tasting very different. Almost a complete dish in itself and pretty nutritious too !
111347,8852,8/25/2004,4,"This was very good and simple to make.  I added some garlic powder, Italian Seasoning, and Jamaica Me Crazy seasoned pepper to spice it up a bit.  It turned out delicious! Thanks for sharing."
104998,8852,3/24/2007,5,"Just made this.  I was looking for a really unusual side dish using rice.  This is fabulous.  

I found it to be quite a bit of work, but well worth it.  It reminds me of tabouli, which I really don't like because of the texture of the wheat.  With the rice, it is really really good."
127231,20152,1/30/2005,5,This was a beautiful recipe. It was not too rich and a beautiful easy mix! I lightly chopped the raspberries before adding. I also sprinkled a Cadbury Flake over the top of the cream topping to make it look extra special!
51000,53217,2/15/2003,2,"I thought this sounded interesting, but  I wasnt too fond of it...  I didnt really like the addition of the corn and the pine nuts didnt really go well with this dish, but it was an interesting recipe."
29956,53433,2/23/2003,5,"Light,moist,low-fat and delicious. What more could you ask for?"
6836,53433,6/29/2003,3,"I was looking for a special blueberry recipe for someone's birthday, so decided to try these muffins - I was disappointed. While the flavor was very good, I found them to be rather dough-y, and they were not what I would consider large & light.  Even with the amount of baking powder in them, they did not rise like I thought they would - in fact, they barely rose above the top of the muffin tin, and when they cooled they sank.  I don't think I will try them again, but thanks for posting.

110034,92490,8/6/2004,5,I preheated my cast iron grill pan as the oven heated up and it gave a nice grilled look to the filets.  This was sooooo good and so easy that it will make frequent appearances on my table.  Thanks so much!
146703,92490,9/14/2004,5,"This tasted amazing and was probably one of the easiest dinners i've ever made. Not to mention it still tastes good the next day, no reheating required. As a student with little time to cook, this recipe is well appreciated both by me and by everyone i've shared it with."
53425,92490,1/11/2005,4,"I cut this in half since there is just the two of us. I thought it was very good, but perhaps a little sweet. It was certainly quick and simple to do. "
58038,92490,6/24/2008,4,Nice flavor but more subtle than I expected.  Quite easy to prepare.  I used fillets and made 1/2 recipe which was more than enough for 2 of us.
182010,139072,10/6/2005,5,"A lovely light mousse--I used reduced fat mayo and garnished the mousse with cucmber, red bell pepper and fresh herbs.  A very nice appetizer, first course or even luncheon dish.  Thanks, Lori!"
197023,139072,10/9/2005,5,"Lauralie41’s recipe had wonderfully clear instructions, for which I was most grateful.  Because there is some chilling time involved, on a first reading, this recipe may sound a little complicated, but it isn’t really.  I know I’ll make it more confidently a second time.  I loved the sound of the ingredients and was delighted with the elegance – to say nothing of the taste – of the mousse once it was ready to serve and eat.  I added a tablespoon of fresh dill, in step 1.  Everyone loved this mousse!  A wonderful blend of flavours.  And a lovely smooth texture.  Thank you for a real gem of a recipe, which I’ll enjoy making again – in summer."
1925885,139072,9/1/2017,5,"Amazingly good! And so easy, too! The hardest part was the whipping of the egg white by hand. Owie! But it was worth the effort. Because there are only two of us, I made the mousse in three mini-bundt pans, so we could have it on three separate occasions. One mini-bundt was the perfect size for including on our smorgasbord platter for the two of us! The mousse is so light and airy, but with such a great flavor! I served this with some Wasa Rye Crispbreads, and it was phenomenal! So good, we're considering who to invite over for another Smorgasbord tomorrow night - so we can share this great find! Thanks for posting this keeper of a recipe! Made for CQ4, Team Happy Campers."
424680,185550,5/4/2012,5,"That's a lot of stuff to put into a salt substitute, but I followed your recipe right on down & then shared it during a small neighborhood potluck, & it did get the raves! Many thanks for posting the recipe! [Made & reviewed for the closing of Pick A Chef event]"
344231,234985,6/27/2007,5,"As good as any mussels I've had here in the top New Zealand restaurants!  Made for the ZWT3, Mexican Challenge.  Thanks, Julie."
107651,257195,4/22/2008,4,"I love these old-time recipes! Always basic and very simple, I used shortening in the dough; and baked them for about 12 minutes.  Nice hot with butter and jam!"
50969,257195,4/24/2008,4,"I made these as part of mine and SO's dinner and also for ""Flour Power Challenge April 2008"". The biscuits were light and fluffy.And as Elly in Canada said ""Basic and Simple recipes are the best "".These baked up very well in about 15 minutes in my oven.Thanks for posting, and ""Keep Smiling :)"""
424008,257195,9/6/2008,5,not bad at all :)   will be making these again :)  thanks for posting
67656,258345,10/21/2007,4,"I'm going to give this a two part review because I think reactions to this will differ based on whether you are comparing them to other baked or deep fried versions.  These really do mirror the famed spuds of McD's and if you are looking for a healthy rendition of that fry, you must make these and will be thrilled with the find.  I know were I serving these to my teenage nephews they would give them 10 stars, no reservations.  As  someone who regularly eats baked fries, I actually found found these to be a little oily. Also managed to discover that I prefer a thicker cut of fries.  Will certainly make these again, none the less."
107583,258345,10/26/2007,4,"These were good, but to be honest, I haven't had McD's fries for about 10 years, so can't compare them. :)
I used 1 large potato and it was plenty for 2 of us, with a turkey burger.  I like the idea of par-boiling and will try that with my regular oven-fries, which are thicker and still have the peels on them.  Like Toni, I prefer the thicker cut."
484390,258345,11/1/2007,5,Just like Mickey D's-alos made them with sweet potaoes for a twist and even the kids loved them.
444607,258345,12/25/2007,5,wow! these were amazing. and sooo easy. i used this lo cal butter in place of the olive oil and they tasted just like fast food fries. thanks a bunch honey!
409333,258345,1/4/2008,5,"These were great! I had these with a turkey burger that I made for dinner tonight. My husband wasn't so sure about them so he had a baked potato instead, but I think after he saw that they turned out well he was wished he had picked the homemade fries. They were pretty easy as well. Oh and I also left the peel on."
469831,258345,1/16/2008,5,"Hey! These babies are pretty darned good! I followed directions exactly, pulled them out of the oven a little too early (my fault, I was afraid of overbaking them), they were just a tad soft, but the flavor was delishhhhh...will definitely be using this recipe often. My 12-year old thought I should have doubled the recipe just for her! :) Thanks for posting."
337449,258345,3/25/2008,5,This took a lot longer to cook for me because I tried to cook enough for 3 at the same time. I didn't have enough time to get them as crispy as I'd like; I'll have to budget more time in the future. Will definitely make these again. My family thought they were better than McDonald's fries!
24386,258345,5/2/2008,5,Absolutely fabulous!   Made these to go with a fish dinner and we enjoyed them thoroughly. Even picky DH was talking about them for several days after. Into the keeper file they go.  Love that they are low fat also!
337963,258345,5/14/2008,3,"We liked these!  They took me much longer to prepare than 5 minutes as peeling and cutting into 1/4 inch strips then making sure they are single layer on the baking sheet takes a while.  I would cut down on the salt added with the oil too.  thank you MamaJ, definitely a good recipe to play with."
294000,258345,5/31/2008,5,"Really good and easy.  Took a little over 30 minutes for our fries but they were worth the wait.  In spite of a nasty cut during the peeling process, I will make these again... just a little more carefully!"
804851,258345,6/14/2008,5,Saw these were made with EVOO and decided this was the best choice to have with my Fish-O-Filet sandwich for lunch.  These were easy to make and we loved them along with our sandwich!
29782,258345,7/29/2008,5,"What a great new way of making french fries!  They were YUMMY!
I didn't think they were like McDonalds but still good.  I love the idea of boiling them and than baking in oven.  They did need longer than 25 minutes to turn lightly brown on edges.  This will be a keeper for future times! Thanks for sharing the recipe :)"
248023,258345,8/9/2008,4,"I used one large russet and got a really nice sized portion of fries from it...  They did not crisp up as much as I thought they would and were a little on the oily side for us...  They did, however, taste good, but nothing like Mc Donald's... to us.  It didn't take me any more time than preparing ""regular"" baked fries, but I think we will stick with our thicker cut, skin on fries.  Thanks for posting!"
609026,258345,2/12/2009,5,"Awesome and easy....my fave things about recipes!!!! Tasted suspiciously similar to micky d's, and with so little fat!! I baked mine @ 400 degrees for 10 minutes, tossed em around on the pan, and then cooked em for 5 more minutes and they were lightly crispy but soft like micky d's!! Will totally make this again! Thanks 4 the healthy yummy recipe!!"
569675,258345,4/26/2009,5,Our family loves these. When we are craving fast food I make some of these with some venison sloppy joes or turkey burgers and it hits the spot. Thanks for posting =)
116869,258345,9/8/2009,0,"Made this tonight with home-grilled burgers.  Very, very good, but I had a little trouble getting them done.  Turned the oven up to 450 for the last 5 minutes -- they probably cooked about 35 min. in the oven, total.  Maybe just my oven's idiosyncrasy though!"
930470,258345,10/7/2009,5,yum yum!! definately worth the work.  i would use sweet potatoes next time to mix it up. great recipe. they taste deep fried even though they're baked - not dried out at all like some baked french fry recipes. I didn't measure 9 oz exactly and they still turned out great.
201581,258345,8/13/2010,5,"I had to reduce that sodium count so I just used 1/2 teaspoon salt in the boiling water and none with the EVOO. They were perfectly salted for my taste. These were very satisfying for a fast-food ""fix""! I will be making these again. Thanks for posting MamaJ. Made for Choose Your Event Party."
844554,258345,8/28/2010,5,"I could see where this does taste a little like McD's fries. I used alot less salt and added cayenne pepper to ours. I also left the skin on. Next time (definitely making again), I'll cook it a little bit longer since we like ours crunchier. Very good!! Made for I Recommend Zaar Tag Game 2010."
127933,258345,9/10/2010,5,"Super YUMMY! My 2 YO DD is a frech fry freak, so when she asked for them, and I didn't have any frozen ones, I turned to food.com for a quick recipe. Knowing I didn't want to deep fry, this one went to the top of the list. I'm SO GLAD I tried them! Perfect with just the right mix of crunch and tenderness. I ended up using vegetable oil intead of EVOO (I didn't have any one hand), but they still turned out fantastic. I will be making them again VERY soon (I still have a whole bag of potatoes!). Oh, and my 2 YO LOVED them too! No more McD's for us! THANK YOU!"
1657681,258345,10/31/2010,5,"I just made these because I was havinga craving for homemade fries and while my recipe is very good, I often find the center of my old recipe fries is not as soft as I'd like (my usual recipe does not boil the fries before cooking; quite the opposite, it calls for the fries to be soaked in cold water).  So I tried this simply for the cooking method and the word ""Mc Donald's didn't hurt.  I read the other reviews and figured the amount of salt would be too much for me, as I don't like super salty fries.  It turned out wonderfully, this was the first time I had crispy fries from the oven.  Thank you for posting this recipe!"
949002,350006,2/26/2009,4,"We loved it!  We made a few variations to the recipe: chicken thighs (whole, and were falling off the bone and so tender at the end of cooking!); no celery so added extra carrot, spring onion and used celery salt (rather than salt); used two cans of 400 g chopped tomatoes; used small can of chickpeas and standard size of cannelini (hard to get black beans in NZ); used 2 tsp chipotle chili powder.  as i did not have buffalo wing sauce, i added about 2-3 tsp of chilli garlic sauce and served over potatoes baked in the oven with ranch dressing....so good!  And we have enough left over for dinner tonight! Thanks"
71565,29289,5/6/2003,5,"This is a keeper!  I used 1/4 cup of splenda instead of brown sugar and my grandbaby's pear juice for the fruit juice.  Yummy!  These are going on a camping trip with my husband, son and son-in-law.  These are the best oat bran muffins I've fixed and I've been fixing them for 13 years.  Thanks!"
1511723,258345,7/3/2011,5,"Ive tried about all the other popular recipes for healthy french fries on food.com and these are by far the best.  For me it works best on a more thinly cut french fry like that which McDonald's has and spread them out on a cookie sheet so that no fry overlaps another.  I cook them a little longer in the oven than what the recipe states and I leave the skins on for the vitamin/mineral content they supposedly add,  but that's the only thing I had to change.  The salt content in these is perfect for my tastes but for someone that does not like salt as much myself I would recommend lowering the salt used by maybe a quarter or half.  Boiling the fries in the salt water is what really makes this recipe shine.  They cook crisp on the outside and soft in the middle, unlike most the other healthy fry recipes Ive found.  Soooo yummy and as long as you are accounting for the calories, these are just fine for most of you dieters out there.  I never feel full without some carbs and am trying to lose about 10 lbs of belly fat right now so these fit the bill perfectly because they actually fill me up so Im not snacking all night.  Thank you so much for the great recipe MamaJ and Food.com!!  Even if you are not dieting, try these!!  I seriously think they are better than the fries at McDonald's which contain a whopping 19g of fat and 380 calories in a medium size order!!!"
424680,258345,7/10/2011,5,"Great tasting fries, even if they aren't deep fried! The only change I made in the recipe was to leave the potatoes unpeeled 'cause we enjoy that part of 'em! Just right in saltiness, crispness & satisfactioness! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Made & reviewed as a THANK YOU for playing with us in Please Review My Recipe during the recent tour]"
1365025,258345,7/18/2011,4,I had these in the toaster oven for 35 min but they just didn't get crispy still very good none the less. I will make again but this time in the oven. Made for I Recommend Red White & Blue Tag.
560491,258345,8/12/2011,4,"Very good fries!  My DS's didn't think they tasted like McDonald's but they are 5 and 2 yrs so nothing is the same.  I think they tasted similar; I decreased the amount of salt as well.  Next time I will have to sharpen my knife really well first so I can get them even smaller, closer to fast food size (mine were a little wider).  Made for I Recommend Tag."
1002265,258345,1/23/2012,5,Great recipe!  My kid (who shuns homemade potato anything) loved them.  Took a little longer than I expected though to get the crunch I wanted.  Thank you so much!  There was a little too much salt but that's just my personal taste (and we're low sodium here).
305531,258345,12/11/2012,5,Good fries. I cut mine a little thicker but followed the directions other than that. Easy and tasty. Thanks for sharing. Made for Cookbook Tag.
1803005318,258345,10/16/2016,3,"I follow the recipe as stated and I cooked them for 30 minutes. The fries came out ok, but nothing like I was expecting. These are really no different from your basic oven cooked fries."
137911,274316,1/21/2008,4,"These were yummy!  Since I didn't have leftover stuffing, I bought a box of cornbread stuffing and made that first.  Then followed the directions to make the patties, using breadcrumbs...couldn't find panko.  I ended up using quite a few pots and pans for this recipe and later though that several steps could have been done in the microwave (potatoes, peas, carrots) and that if I had had the stuffing as leftover, that would also be one less pot.  We enjoyed the patties and all four flavors of the ingredients were balanced well.  I served them with some steak last night, but think it would go best with a poultry dish."
1025928,315534,11/27/2008,5,It tasted just like the real thing.  It was very easy to make.  THANK YOU very much.
1231156,315534,4/8/2009,5,THANK YOU!!! I am making this for my family for Easter dinner & I'm SO happy someone could tell me how to make it!!!  Thanks again :)
788414,315534,11/29/2013,5,Really good!  Not sure it even needs the topping.  It&#039;s fantastic with or without!  Thank you!
592141,350006,1/27/2009,5,"This was quite good.  I like the addition of the black beans, something I might not have thought to put in.  I ran out of diced tomatoes, so I used a can of crushed, and that worked out fine.  I think this would freeze well, and I am certainly going to make it again.  Thanks for posting."
251389,350006,2/3/2009,4,"I substituted chicken breasts because I don't care for dark meat, but otherwise made this exactly as written. It was different but good- like a warm bowl of melty buffalo wings! I ate the left overs over lettuce and veggies w/ blue cheese dressing as a taco salad of sorts."
383853,350006,2/9/2009,5,"Whoever invented ""buffalo"" anything is a hero in my book lol!  This was a great soup.  I'm always looking for different crock pot recipes and this one fit the bill.  I did leave out the crumbled blue cheese due to personal preference.  Oh, and also used boneless skinless chicken breasts because i always have them on hand.  Thanks so much for posting this tasty soup!"
860079,350006,2/10/2009,5,"This was quite delicious, though I strayed a little from the recipe as written. I only had 1 lb of chicken, so I added an extra can of black beans and ended up using Rotel with green chilis as that was all the canned tomatoes I had. I served this topped with crumbled tortilla chips and shredded jack cheese, my preference over blue cheese. A wonderful chili, quite unlike any other I've had. Thanks for the keeper recipe Lainey6605! Made for TAG IT RED, Feb 2009."
131698,78834,8/12/2004,5,I made these today for lunch and my four kids thought they were the coolest thing ever!  Especially since we just got back from the coast... they're very interested in sea life right now.  Thanks for sharing!
67656,350006,4/17/2009,5,"More a soup than a chili, the dish was altogether delicious.  My one change was related to the chicken using 1 1/2 pounds chicken breasts as which was the right portion for me.  Skipped the blue cheese as I had none as this was a last minute decision and I only know one play that sells the soy version.  The celery and carrots were a great addition.  Thanks Lainey!"
748213,350006,6/10/2009,5,Excellent!  I use chicken breast instead of thighs and turned out great.
259154,350006,9/5/2009,3,"This is a good chili recipe, but not a great dish for us. I added only about 1.5 # chicken breast because that is what I had. The only other changes were adding a whole cup wing sauce because we like the extra kick and I added some garlic powder and hot sauce while it was cooking. The flavors are good, but I was not thrilled with it."
485773,350006,12/9/2010,5,"Delish!  I used 1/2 cup buffalo sauce, added some salt, and cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours.  So good!"
407007,350006,11/26/2013,5,"Wow, surprisingly good! :) I too used chicken breasts that I put in whole and shredded them near the end of the cooking. I topped with sour cream, cheese, and green onions. Really good and mild flavor - even my 3 year old tried this! Thanks for sharing."
847760,377937,7/4/2009,5,Absolutely awesome!!!!!
427184,377937,4/4/2010,5,Very good! The basil mixture was delicious and everyone loved them. Thanks!
177443,378910,4/18/2013,5,"After seeing Ina Garten make this savory coeur a la creme on her tv show &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot;, I had to make it and was thrilled to find the recipe right here on food dot com. Wonderful! This version is easy to make, no need for fancy molds, and it&#039;s a nice change from sweet versions. Decadent, creamy rich and delicious with a nice light and bright fresh lemony tang to it, that we loved. Next time, I may add a teaspoon of minced fresh lemon verbena or lemon thyme to it, as well. Note that for best results the cream cheese must be at room temp and your whipping cream or heavy cream must be cold. I served the savory coeur a la creme as a yummy afternoon snack with Major Grey chutney drizzled over the top, Carr&#039;s whole wheat crackers on the side, and a nice glass of rose wine. Five stars all the way, thanks for sharing! :)"
898401,403390,12/15/2009,5,"I made this for a Holiday party, it was a HUGE it! I cut the recipe in half and still had some left over, approx 14 people were at the party, and other appetizers were served.  I used Franks Hotsauce Original."
1191411,403390,1/31/2010,5,YUUUMMMMYYY!!!!! Made this for a party along with tons of other stuff. I followed the recipe and it was the first thing to go and everyone asked for the recipe! My brother had to run to the store to get more stuff so i could make more! thanks!
128473,470046,5/21/2014,5,"Wow Tisme, wow.  I love mangoes.  Fresh, cooked in preserves, jams or lemonades, you can&#039;t go wrong. This delicious recipe does not disappoint, it is the nicest, best tasting preserve that I have made here on food to date.  I now have a go to for mango preserves.  The flavor is simply outstanding, sweet, tart and spicy.  The texture is perfect, thick, light and tender.  I made as written but added a Thai red bird chili pepper and 1/2 a big vanilla bean to the mixture and also used white balsamic vinegar.   Everything worked beautifully with the mangoes.  Thank you so much for sharing a recipe that has gone into my Favorites Cookbook for 2014.  Kudos to you my dear."
2909438,499120,7/20/2013,5,Good
285039,499120,8/8/2013,4,I had an average piece of salmon in the freezer and was looking for a nice salad recipe to use it up!  This salad was a fantastic way to do so!  I used Panera&#039;s Asian dressing instead of the one suggested.
334010,7679,12/15/2009,5,This was amazing - one of the best new recipes I've tried in months! The only change I made was a splash of sherry when the sauce got too thick.  Thanks!
212497,7679,6/17/2011,4,"Great recipe! I made this for my hubby because we were heading to New Orleans for our honeymoon and I was trying to showcase some of the local cuisine for him. He loved it! I do agree with Wugfun's review that you need more liquid while you're cooking the sauce (I also used Sherry and when I ran out, I used a little bit of Vermouth). I don't know if that changed the flavor but it was pretty darned good! Thank you for posting. I will make it again!"
12657,29289,5/28/2002,5,"I was intrigued by the fact that there was no flour in the recipe, and because of that, they're very soft and bit crumbly, but that doesn't matter the slightest bit because all the fruit flavours mingle together beautifully to make really tasty muffins! I halved the recipe and omitted the apricots and egg substitute, which I didn't have. I also used orange juice and regular milk. This tastes great for breakfast along with a steaming cup of coffee!"
42366,29289,6/5/2002,5,"I made these for my 4-year-old yesterday, and she asked for them again today!!  I couldn't get to the kitchen fast enough because they were excellent and healthy to boot!  Thanks for a great kid-friendly, healthy recipe."
41564,29289,6/17/2002,5,"Wonderful!! These were a great big hit!! And good for you too, what else could you want? Thanks!!"
42170,29289,10/25/2002,5,How can something so good for you be so tasty> these will be a morning regular.
31969,29289,6/7/2003,5,"Thanks for this excellent recipe! I have been making these muffins a lot, and each time they come out perfectly. The batter is moist and so is very easy to handle (no overmixing!!), and the muffins are really tasty despite the low sugar content. I love the taste of oatbran, but porridge was all I could do about it. This recipe offers a great alternative! And thanks again for giving me hope out of the other disappointing muffin recipes ^^"
5684,29289,2/29/2004,5,"This is a terrific recipe.  Over the past couple of weeks, I have tried many different bran muffin recipes and have concluded that this one was the best.  This is definitely a keeper.  My own variations were small.  I added 4 single packets of Splenda to ensure sweetness, though it probably didn't need it.  As a fruit juice, I used orange juice.  Instead of dried apricots, I used an equivalent amount of dried apples, since I had recently dehydrated them myself.  For the small grated apple in the recipe, I used a Granny Smith apple.  The recipe allows much latitude on juices and fruit one can use.  Since we're on a low-carb diet, we will use only this bran muffin recipe from now on.  It is definitely a 5-Star Recipe."
145397,29289,6/11/2004,5,"I used a sugar substitute for this recipe, raisins in place of apricots (didn't have any) and blue berries instead of Banana(High sugar). And it became totally non-fat, no sugar and for all on diet it's great news! It tasted really really good too! I'm gonna bake this very frequently. Thanks a million for this! "
110930,29289,8/28/2004,5,"I substituted freely with the recipe, using chocolate chips in one batch and cranberries in another instead of apricots, soy milk instead of real milk, and apple sauce just because it was handier.  Very moist and fruity muffin.  "
176615,29289,3/18/2005,5,"A healthy muffin that makes a great breakfast! Moist and fruity, I also liked that it was made from all oat bran, no flour. I used OJ, otherwise as stated. Froze the leftovers and have been heating them up for breakfast. I'll make these again and again! Thanks, LDJ, for posting!"
198612,29289,3/19/2005,3,"Yes, these were moist, but I thought they had no identity... Not really banana muffins, neither really apple muffins, nor apricot... "
198601,29289,10/2/2005,0,"These muffins were good for only 2 WW points, but not really my taste.  I used prune juice and a pear instead of the apple.  If you like bran muffins, these may be good."
359533,29289,7/22/2007,4,"These are very good low fat bran muffins! I used applesauce instead of fruit juice and blueberries instead of banana, apple and apricots (though I do want to try it as written as well!!) And I used two egg whites instead of the egg substitute. If I make them again, I may experiement with fat free yogurt for some of the mil to help make them less crumbly. But the banana might do that too. However, they are quite delicious and filling!"
341513,29289,5/18/2010,4,"I made this as directed with an egg and again with many substitutions including instant oatmeal and wheat flour. Both times it came out fine, moist. It is an extremely flexible recipe, but beware that the substitutions affect the flavor balance making it only ok sometimes."
2000498330,49474,12/4/2018,5,So delicious. Used good quality smoked turkey and Havarti cheese. The savory with just a touch of sweet definitely hits with me.
74558,78834,12/15/2003,0,"I remember being mother to four younger siblings while mamma was away at her ""canning-factory"" job.  Anyone with younger siblings knows how difficult it was to be a ""parent"" at age 10.  Imagination was key in the preparation of gourmet meals, hot dogs, nothwithstanding...where were you, winkki, when creativity failed me?"
6357,78834,12/15/2003,5,"Woah, this was fun to make for my younger brother for whom I have been playing momma since the last few days. He laughed and ate 'em all. Thank you so much for the creative idea! BTW, my bro is 19 and if he loved these, I'm sure everyone will:) Thanks again for the fun idea!"
120108,78834,1/3/2004,5,I read another review about a 19 yr old male who loved these. I do these and set them up on a bed of mac and cheese with little fish crackers. Dab dots for eyes and a line for the mouth. My kids think they are wonderful!! They chow it!
123777,78834,1/28/2004,0,"I seen this in a magazine, they made a bunch of them and placed them on spaghetti noodles that were cooked in green water to turn then green and they used mustard to draw a face on them SO CUTE, especially for the birthday party idea!"
65056,78834,3/2/2004,5,These are just completely adorable!
87236,78834,11/14/2004,5,"These are so quick and easy to fix, and the kids love 'em!  I nuked them in the microwave for 17 seconds, and my twins were all giggles when I served them!  Thanks for posting this, Winkki!"
156653,78834,11/18/2004,5,"I made these for my son for lunch, and he loved them! Who wouldn't love a cute looking hotdog? Thank you for reminding me of my own childhood. Hope you like the pic!"
1535,78834,2/2/2005,5,"Made these for my kids one day as a surprise and they thought they were really neat. Being a perfectionist, I did have to make 8 legs but that's just me! An easy way to add some fun to lunch."
149363,78834,4/15/2005,5,"This is a great idea!
My DD love hot dogs this way, it's so much fun. They can also be cooked over a campfire on a stick this way, or grilled.
Thanks for posting a great technique Winkki!"
169969,78834,4/24/2005,5,"This was a huge hit! I used Organic Beef Hotdogs and placed them on Organic Mac and Cheese and sprinkeled some Goldfish crackers on the mac. A very picky and three year old that eats like a bird, ate EVERYTHING on his plate so that he could get another octopus! Great Recipe!!!"
176615,78834,6/16/2005,5,"Cute and easy! The kids thought these were great. Thanks, winkki!"
158086,78834,6/23/2005,5,Made these with Classic Baked Spaghetti for the kids for Fathers Day Dinner...they loved them....
104295,78834,7/22/2005,5,In the 6 years I have been a parent I think I have only had hotdogs in the house twice.  Just not something I buy.  But while I was gone someone obviously did as I found them in my fridge!  The kids loved these.  Though my son did comment on the fact that I had not cut enough legs!
193499,78834,5/12/2006,5,"These are so much fun!  I atually make them over the bon fire.  Same sort of idea without the boiling part.  I cut them the same, then poke a long stick through the ""head"" part. The legs still curl up.  My kids love them!  "
197067,78834,9/6/2006,5,"Haven't tried this, but how can you go wrong? This is too cute and although I don't have any I could see how any kid (including myself--even though I'm 20 years old) could love this!"
344716,78834,3/1/2007,5,"my kids love these. [lol] i found this idea once in a magazine.. kraft kitchens or something. so cute.. i l've put them on top of kraft dinner, or just made them for a snack. :)"
510693,78834,6/3/2007,4,I have been trying and trying to make these but couldn't. THis recipe helped me figure out how to curl the legs. THANKS!
497561,78834,8/24/2007,5,This is an awesome idea.
43083,78834,9/26/2007,4,"My 5 yr old loved these! I made him two and although my tentacles didnt fare to well, he scarfed them down. Thanks for a cute idea! :)"
531155,78834,12/3/2007,5,"I actually have this recipe in a kid's cookbook my MIL bought. Only difference is that it suggested using ramen noodles as an ""ocean"" and making a mustard face on the octopus."
604324,78834,4/13/2008,5,These are too cute. I served them over baked mac and cheese for my picky DH2B who's 25. Haha
592157,78834,7/2/2008,5,Thank you for sharing this idea. It was a real hit with my little one.
502302,78834,4/10/2009,5,I've been wanting to try this for a while. My daughter isnt' yet 3 so I wasn't sure if she would like it. I made one cut on the first side but two on the 2nd side. (it was a larger sized dog). That way I got 6 legs which looked pretty realistic. She ate it all as well as the plain noodles that I served smothered in ketchup.
1345244,78834,10/23/2010,5,"My 2 year old son's face lit up when he saw his plate.  ""What's that?"" I asked.  And he knew right away it was an octopus.  Simple and fun."
303427,78834,10/24/2010,5,So cute and easy! We enjoyed this for lunch over mac & cheese! Thank you so much for the great idea!
162833,101737,10/22/2004,5,A+ for these!  Very tasty. I cooked a rump roast in the crock pot overnight and made the BBQ beef the next day.  I cooked the shredded beef on the stovetop also.  Will surely make again.  Thank you!  
189643,101737,3/22/2005,4,"We thought these were just a little on the sweet side, so next time I'll cut down the sugar by a Tbsp. We also added a little more water as it cooked-for some reason ours wanted to dry out. Other than that, the blend of flavors was great! I used venison, and had to leave out the celery (dh won't eat anything with celery). We'll definitely be eating this again! Thanks!"
130395,101737,4/24/2005,5,OUTSTANDING!We actually love the sweetness of this.Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow..Thanks Angie for a great recipe.
143218,101737,12/28/2005,5,"We LOVED this recipe. I used a 3.36 pound boneless rump roast. I pan seared it and the it went into a dutch oven, covered, with a little water in the pan. It roasted at 325 degrees for about 3 hours...my meat thermometer said it was overcooked, but the meat till shredded and seemed yummy after it all cooled down. I followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed. I will make this again and again and for company as well. It was delicious! Thanks EdsGirlAngie for a keeper!"
352538,101737,6/4/2007,0,"This was wonderful but I ended up making so many changes that I decided not to give it any stars as I wasn't sure how the original recipe would be.   I am reviewing it anyway so I remember what I did for next time and so everyone can see how forgiving this recipe is.  I had no ketchup so I planned to use plain tomato sauce.  Therefore, I added 50% more cider vinegar, sugar and worcestershire sauce.  I also added a bit of extra mustard.  I was out of tabasco so I used about 2 tsp of Rooster hot pepper sauce.  Then when I was about to add the tomato sauce I found half a bottle of Bullseye Barbeque sauce and ended up using that instead.  So it had way more spice than this recipe called for but we thought it was amazing.   We like things very spicy so I'm glad I made the changes.  However you make this I'm sure it will be good.  Thanks for sharing."
268955,101737,10/14/2008,5,"We loved this, but I, like others, did not follow the recipe.  Used a bone-in chuck roast, browned in a Dutch over, then into oven with 2 cups of water, covered for 2 hours.  I didn't have 2 c of ketchup, so used about 1 c plus some bbq sauce and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  Skipped the Tabasco and used 1/2 t cayenne instead.  Used only 1 T sugar and it was plenty sweet for us.  Yum!"
41879,101737,1/11/2009,5,"Delicious!  Made roast beef in crockpot and then used the liquid from that instead of water in the recipe, which I also made in the crockpot.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Made great sandwiches for today's football game!  Thanks!"
199020,101737,1/20/2009,5,"I LOVE BBQ, and this is some of the BEST!  Definitely the best I have ever fixed.  We loved it!  I made the roast in the crock pot so it would be nice and tender, and I used another reviewer's suggestion of using beef broth instead of water.  Other than that, I made it exactly as directed.  Thanks for the recipe!  It will be going in my favorites."
60260,101737,9/18/2011,5,"Great recipe!!  I tripled this recipe to serve at a football dinner - made it ""as is""  except left the celery out because I was serving teens and you never know with them!  I cooked my chuck roasts ahead of time in the crock pot and then put it all in an electric roaster and cooked on 200-250 for about 6 hours.  The boys went crazy over it and my son said the boys are still talking about the meal.   This one is a keeper and will be made again.  Thanks for sharing!"
320216,101737,11/29/2011,5,"Outstanding as it is. If you need to make adjustments as per your taste, feel free to do so. A recipe is no more than a guide. Break your mother's cardinal rule and play with your food to make it to your taste or simply reject it. It comes down to personal taste."
381180,112378,3/25/2011,5,Pretty and delicious!  Would be even more gorgeous with larger shrimp ~ my shrimp were small!   Made for Spring PAC 2011.
57222,112378,4/9/2012,5,"Wonderful, fresh & sunny flavours! I used half chicken and half shrimp (I don't eat shrimp, while SO likes it a lot!) and marinated and cooked them separately; the marinade worked beautifully with the chicken too! We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and look forward to making this again. Thank you for a gorgeous recipe Britgal!"
88378,112378,1/27/2013,5,"Yeeee-ummmy!  I only had green pepper, red would be prettier on the plate!  I squeezed my oranges to make 4 T. juice and opted not to use the orange sections in the finished dish.  I used 1/2 t. crushed red pepper flakes and that provided a nice little burst of heat.  As we'd just eaten rice the night before, I served the shrimp over a choice of fresh sauteed spinach or egg noodles, along with crunchy bread.  We thought this shrimp was divine!  Will make again!  Thanks!"
2000458487,112378,2/27/2017,1,This dish was very 'Blah'. It needed some soy sauce and definitely use peanut oil rather than sunflower oil. Very disappointing and a waste of good shrimp. Will never make again!
2001116820,186327,8/6/2016,5,"Came home to a boneless pork chop. While the grill was heating-up, I searched for a sugar-free rub. I found this one, and had all the ingredients on hand. It took no time to mix up, sprinkle on the pork, and throw on the grill. It was VERY GOOD!!! Thanks!"
79877,213093,4/11/2007,4,"Loved it, nice change from a regular Caesar.  I'll make it again."
545717,316804,8/3/2008,5,"I've been waiting a long time for this recipe.
Your photos helped the process. Thank you for your time and effort on this endeavor. YUM!"
415934,316804,8/25/2008,2,"This didn't work for me.  I was pretty disappointed in this recipe.  The rolls didn't rise well so they were pretty dense.  I felt like they needed a little more salt.

I followed the recipe exactly so I didn't use a greased pan (though I had a little inner argument about whether or not I should since I'm not a complete baking newbie) -- needless to say, half of each roll had to be soaked off the baking sheet."
726003,321993,10/8/2008,5,"I made this or breakfast this morning.  It was fabulous!

I made it exactly as the recipe and we ate the lot!  Fast and easy and a very tasty way to eat porridge!

I personally dislike oatmeal - so I am glad to find a recipe I enjoy!"
1051822,335865,11/29/2008,4,Very fast and easy to make nice soft and sweet very good recipe if one has little time..
653438,343674,11/30/2009,5,Made this for Zaar Alphabet Soup Tag 2009.  DH enjoyed it very very much and said please serve this again.  I followed the directions except to add a clove of garlic (we love garlic) and cut it in half.  It isn't a rich chowder but nice to be able to have several vegies in a soup and get everyone to eat them.  Thank you.
464080,343674,4/17/2012,5,Great chowder!  I used some leftover hashbrown (cubed) potatoes that I had frozen as well as corn leftover from Easter AND subbed our leftover Easter ham for the bacon and WOW was the result tasty.  Thanks so much for posting this soup.  I will most likely make it again.  Made for PAC.
171790,369668,7/29/2009,4,Nice soup. I couldn't get a serrano chili and had to use jalapeno instead. I could be for this reason that I found the soup a bit more bland than I would have liked. I added some freshly ground pepper and Cajun seasoning and loved it that way. Made for Newest Zaar Tag.
1418435,369668,8/26/2010,4,"This was awesome! I added shredded chicken to the recipe, and it was fantastic! Perfect spice and the sour cream to top it was great. I would recommend taking a bean-o before eating though."
424680,446919,2/18/2011,5,"Very nice tasting chili this is! When making it I took your advice (since we DO like lots of beans in our chili) & used 2 additional cans of those as well as another can of the tomatoes! So easy to make it, too! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
461834,446919,9/26/2011,4,"I loved that this chili was more soupy then stew like consistency.  I wasn't sure about the amount of chili powder, thinking it might be too much, but it was the right amount for me.  To me it was just lacking some seasoning, so I added some garlic powder, salt, pepper and onion salt, next time I would add chopped onion to the meat, while browning.  I used dark red kidney beans, as thats what I had on hand and it wouldn't change the flavor of the chili sauce.  I used Rotel for the tomatoes and peppers mix and did opt to add the cheddar cheese and green onion.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
679953,446919,11/26/2011,5,"I did add a very small dash of onion powder, and some pepper to this, and this was some of the best chili we have had in a while.  Loved the chili powder and used what was posted in the recipe. Great little treat for a cool, damp day.  Made for 1-2-3 hits."
369715,446919,8/2/2012,3,"As written this was OK for us. We thought the chili was way too thin and the sauce didn't have much taste. I added onion powder, minced garlic, tomato sauce and tomato paste and then we enjoyed it more. I also added two cans of black beans and only one heaping tablespoon of chili powder as I don't like it too spicy. This was very easy to make."
227978,484124,8/12/2012,3,"I had a lot of hopes for this recipe, but I encountered a few problems with this recipe.  I've never made damper before, so perhaps I did something wrong.  The biggest issue was that the instructions didn't state what size of tin to use, so I used my muffin pan since I didn't think the small amount of dough was intended for a loaf.  And the little dampers didn't rise a bit.  They came out about 1 inch high, and they were not done in the center, even after 80 minutes of baking.  But the top and edges were nicely baked, so I didn't risk baking any longer for fear of burning the tops.  Next time, I will try adding a little baking powder for a loftier damper, and I'll probably add a little sugar for a slight boost of sweetness.  Made for ZWT8 - Australia."
103142,3881,2/15/2008,4,"Too much worcestershire.  Try cutting it down a bit to taste.  Otherwise, this was very easy and fine tasting, just how I like it!"
980936,3881,4/30/2009,4,"I was a bit skeptical about how this would turn out since it had no anchovies nor real garlic. I used Garlic Plus instead of garlic powder (I was out, and also out of real garlic, which I think would make this recipe zing!). It turned out pretty good, and the hubby liked it, and that's what matters most! :D"
21987,12044,10/24/2001,5,"This Is definitley the best stew i have had yet i used beef insead of Venison since i didnt have any
but i also added 1 tablespoon of liquid smoke Marinade WOW!! its great you can also cook this is a crock pot for 6 hours on high"
13348,12044,11/16/2001,5,This is a great stew for venison or beef.  It's also great to freeze for later.
24217,12044,11/27/2001,5,"Great stew! I coat the meat with flour, salt and pepper before browning though.  That way you don't have to add it later to thicken the stew and you avoid that raw flour taste you ocasionally get when adding flour straight to a soup or stew."
16827,12044,4/18/2002,3,"I made this stew using beef.  I love beef stew and have been on a quest for a really great beefy flavored instead of tomatoe stew. It was very bland and really needs something, I don't know what, to spice it up!"
51851,12044,9/9/2002,4,We have a sun oven (which is like a crockpot only the sun cooks it) and I love to make stews and soups in it.  I love this recipe in late summer since the days are warm and the nights cool.  It is so good over polenta.  Thanks.
65531,12044,12/26/2002,5,This stew was very good. I would highly recommend it to anyone. I have already given it to some of my friends. 
82737,12044,7/15/2003,5,This was a great venison stew!  I'm just so disappointed that it's all gone already.  Next time I'm going to make twice as much so I can freeze some for later.
111811,12044,11/24/2003,4,Very good and easy to make.I threw in a handfull of pot barley
55380,12044,12/28/2003,5,"My first-ever attempt at cooking with venison! I only had coarse-ground meat, but it substituted well (served it over rice to give it a little more body). I added a little red wine, thyme, and rosemary, per our family preferences, but they were 'extras,' not basic changes that needed to be made. It was a hit! Dh and kids all had seconds (even thirds), although we didn't go into detail with the girls exactly what 'venison' is. ;o) I asked if they wanted me to make it again...they said tomorrow would be good, lol. Thanks for sharing!"
18787,12044,3/21/2004,5,"This stew came out very well but I don't recommend using the liquid smoke, it really doesn't need it."
130663,12044,11/15/2004,5,"Made the stew as recipe stated. It was very good and we,ll make it again."
109547,12044,12/5/2004,5,I made this stew for deer camp this year and it was a hit.  I didn't use the carrots(not a fan of cooked carrots)but did add green pepper.  All at camp raved and want it again next year.  One inch squares of green pepper adds a unique flavor to it.  Thanks for posting!
111347,12044,1/10/2005,5,This was very good!  I added peas and sprinkled with shredded cheddar cheese when it was done. Thanks for sharing! 
84657,12044,1/13/2005,5,this stew was great...really easy to make (just throw everything into the crockpot) and so good! my husband almost ate the whole crockpot in one day. the meat was so tender when it was finished cooking.
341064,12044,11/15/2006,5,"Delicious!!!!!!!  I had to put more meat in the second time I cooked it, the 1lb just fell apart and left the stew light on the venison.  My brother had some and he was astonished that it was venison.  A real winner in our household especially when Mike my husband, comes back from a long cold and rain or snowy hunting day."
238201,12044,7/7/2007,5,"This was the best stew I have ever had, also my first time making stew. I did make a few changes. I used one big potato cut up, and two small cans of mushrooms drained. I did not have beef broth so I just did 2 cups of water and two beef bulion cubes. I threw it all in the crockpot and cooked on high for 6 hours. I add the flour and salt in pepper in when I had two hours left, I kept stirring it and it turned out wonderful. This is a keeper"
641076,12044,11/29/2007,5,"This is a keeper! I am not a big venison eater at all, but this was awsome! My family loved it! I made a big crock pot full, and all that was left was just enough for my husbands lunch the next day. He liked it so much that he asked me to make anothe pot so that he could take it to work to share with his buddies! I made some home made rolls with this and it was gone! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!"
254805,12044,1/10/2008,5,This was wonderful! I've tried many stew recipes here on Zaar and I hadn't yet found a classic thick and meaty stew yet. Until this one. I love doing it in the crock pot and I love adding the flour later. I mixed the flour with a little cold water then let it cook down to the right consistency.  I used beef and fresh garlic and it was heavenly comfort food with my fresh  honey wheat rolls.
513039,12044,12/5/2008,5,"My husband said this was the best stew he has ever eaten! My kids were not too hot on it, but I think it was really good, too. I did not have mushrooms so did not add them, but will next time because I love them. The meat was great- falling apart and not a gamey flavor at all. Yummy recipe and sooo easy."
150690,12044,12/23/2008,5,"Before this recipe I thought I only liked venison that was ground with beef added. This recipe change that!  This is excellent, not gamey at all, very tender and flavorful.  I didn't have any mushrooms and added some frozen corn at the end. I cooked it for 6 hours on high.  I added some sour cream to the leftovers and a bit more broth and served it over noodles the next night."
288146,12044,2/1/2009,5,"Awesome stew!  I followed the recipe exactly (which I hardly ever do) and it was fantastic!  One of the best stews I've ever made.  Thanks for posting, I will definitely be making again."
336058,12044,2/24/2009,4,"Turned out great.  I must have tender venison, because it was done after less than 6 hours on high.  I tossed the stew in the flour, salt and pepper, and browned it then.  I doubled the other seasonings.  No mushrooms for us.  I put Bisquick ""dumplings"" on top and let cook for about 15 minutes at the end.  Family liked it.  I might try some red wine, instead of water next time to add some richness.  Now I just have to beg some more venison off of my in-laws! LOL!"
285661,12044,7/26/2009,5,This has turned out to be a great favorite of mine and my hungery hunter!  Perfect comfort food recipe.
670722,12044,12/30/2009,5,"Great Stew and VERY easy to make! I used presliced & washed mushrooms, baby carrots and two 14oz cans of beef broth. Cooked in crock pot overnight. Put in fridge during the day and then heated at dinner time adding Bisquick dumplings on top. WOW! Already planning to make again."
932039,12044,3/10/2010,5,I have been trying stew recipes for a couple years now and just never found the perfect one - my search has finally ended!  I added a tbsp of minced garlic when I browned the meat (because I add garlic to almost everything).  I also put dumplings in the crock pot for the last 25 minutes (the Bisquick Dumpling recipe from this site).  Thank you for such a great recipe!
471300,12044,5/18/2011,5,This is an amazing stew.  I don't have a slow cooker so I did in on the lowest setting on the hob for about half the time.  It was tender and had great rich flavour for such a low calorie dish.  My DH is a hunter and we are always looking for a way to use the stew meat and I think that this will be our go-to recipe from now on.
358596,12044,10/15/2011,1,"BIL said to throw it out. made it according to directions except for browned meat with flour and seasonings. Bland and the mushrooms were an odd ingredient (he likes mushrooms).  I won't bother trying to make again, even with modifications."
325318,12044,10/22/2011,0,"This stew was fantastic. I followed another reviewers suggestion and pre coated the meat with the flour, that way I could just cook it the whole day while I was at work.  I also added a bunch of extra veggies, just cause I had them on hand, sweet potato, turnip, spinach and some celery.  My kids loved it and asked for it for lunch the next day.  Thanks for posting the recipe!"
2000474820,12044,12/14/2015,3,"Definitely needed to be spiced up. Either my family has a robust palette or I don&#039;t know but after we doctored it up with thyme, a bay leaf, more garlic powder and some spoonfuls of tomato paste this stew was actually not bad. I made a roux instead of adding the flour straight in, didn&#039;t want it to taste starch-y. Also, add more salt than you&#039;d think to add. When cooking stew with potatoes I find they&#039;ll absorb most of the salt and leave your stew bland."
24808,13093,2/26/2002,5,Excellent marinate also great on feather bones
191665,13093,8/23/2007,5,I have used this several times on steaks.  Soy sauce also works if you are out of Worcestershire sauce.
720912,13093,2/29/2008,5,made this with chicken forb the grill--i iused southern comfort instead of jack -wonderful! thank you
27395,29712,7/9/2002,4,"Although the end result of this recipe was not really what I had expected, I really enjoyed it. It reminded me more of a blueberry custard. Next time I maight use a little bit more of the cinnamon-sugar mixture, as mine was a bit tart (which very well may have been due to the berries). I actually enjoyed this the best just grabbing a slice out of the refrigerator. I didn't try it warm with butter, but I am sure it would be excellent. I will probably make this again, as it was very easy, with simple ingredients and prep. Thanks!
~Manda"
39341,29712,8/2/2002,1,More like a bad oven pancake than a popover.
146310,29712,10/16/2004,4,I agree that it was more custard than popover but it was still a very good recipe. I used frozen black raspberries and I also used some of the extra cinnamon sugar mix by sprinkling the berries before putting the batter over them. Came out very yummy.:)
158308,85580,4/20/2011,5,"I have used this recipe several times for healthier Passover mayonnaise. I usually keep the optional spices minimal; salt, pepper, and maybe the paprika. The tip in the instructions to use a narrow bowl slightly wider than the mixer was a life saver. I also read a tip somewhere else that if your mayo starts to break, try adding a little boiling water. Though mine didn't break, I added a bit while the mixer was whirling away just to help keep a nice texture. This is a really helpful recipe, thanks for posting!"
167849,85580,9/1/2013,5,"Wow, this recipe works great!  I doubled the amounts and it came out perfectly.  Great flavor and texture.  I put a dash of apple cider vinegar in at the end instead of the second tablespoon of lemon juice.  I used organic eggs and light olive oil.  I omitted all the extra flavorings simply because I wanted this mayo to be flavor-neutral.  I&#039;m a follower of the Paleo/Primal way of eating so this recipe is perfect as it does not use the canola oil and other bad fats usually associated with mayo."
93911,95778,11/14/2004,5,"I used Krusteaz Fat-Free Brownie Mix for this.  The directions on the box did not call for eggs or oil, so I just added the appropriate amount of water and it turned out great."
91392,95778,3/14/2005,5,"Used the spirit of this with a jar of 300 grams of cherries on the bottom of the pan, and Kree's Antidpressant Brownie Recipe--1/2 recipe-- from Zaar, with the cherry juice substituted for the water in the recipe poured over the cherries on the bottom of the pan.  If you added a scoop of ice cream or some creme anglaise, you could serve this to company.  Nice lukewarm."
172861,95778,10/25/2009,5,We used canned cherries and this came out terrific!
212268,95778,12/15/2011,5,"This is so good and gooey and so very, very easy.  I use 2 cans cherry pie filling and 1 can of regular cherries.  It tastes like you worked really hard, but you don't have to!"
197023,110368,6/5/2006,4,"I made this cobbler outside of peach season so I used canned peaches and halved the sugar (a personal taste preference).  We loved the combination of spices and the lemon juice (I added the juice of one lemon) in this dish.  For the crumble crust, I again halved the sugar and used brown sugar, then for the sugar mixed with cinnamon, I yet again used brown sugar (just 2 tablespoons) mixed with the cinnamon.  The end result: a very tasty, easy to make cobbler, which we enjoyed warm with a generous dollop of Greek yoghurt."
176615,110368,7/8/2007,5,"Very yummy! Followed the recipe as stated. Topping was like a giant soft cookie. Used the full amount of cinnamon on top. As Roxygirl pointed out, it does make a brown crust, so be sure not to underbake. Only change I'd make would be to omit the nutmeg as it's not one of my favorites. Enjoyed it! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
280909,134608,11/13/2008,5,"I originally saw this recipe (or a similar one) in an insert that came with Prevention magazine. Distinguishing characteristics being simple ingredients and only thyme, pepper, and nutmeg as spices.  I omitted the cream  and wine and added an extra potato for starchy/creaminess.    This is a great soup for kids and adults since the flavor isn't a spicy flavor but more a savory tangy yummy flavor that appeals to all ages.  Thanks parsley"
1329782,134608,12/6/2009,5,"Excellent Soup! Made it for a dinner party.  The only thing I did different was add white cheddar, which I liked the more white color, a pinch of thyme and then garnished with bacon crumbles and a pinch of the white cheddar and a small thyme sprig, just so people new the flavor.  The bacon just looked pretty.
Excellent recipe, great flavors. The wine just really topped it off for me."
47559,169475,6/3/2006,4,"We really enjoyed this unusual way to prepare cabbage.  The ""gravy"" did mask the strong cabbage taste, and the nutmeg added a very pleasant flavor to it. My DD does not care for cabbage, but agreed to try it, and then she took and ate a whole serving of it.  When making it again, I will reduce the ""gravy"" portion to about half, as I would like to try it a little less creamy.  It's very good as is, though."
107135,169475,6/3/2006,5,"good stuff thanks for posting we had this alot growing up nutmeg a good touch .dee
"
163112,169475,6/8/2006,5,"This was the perfect veggie for a cold rainy day.  The nutmeg makes it special.  Of course THE PICKY ONE didn't care for it, so I got extra!  Thanks, Hope!"
69904,169475,6/13/2006,5,"  I made this as a side dish for dinner and we all enjoyed it, including my 7yo but he's an unusual eater.  It had just the right balance of cream sauce to cabbage for us and was very simple to put together.  Thank you for an additional way of dressing up cooked cabbage.  = )"
258285,169475,11/10/2006,4,We eat alot of cabbage so I'm always looking for different ways to cook it.  This was fab!  I could have eaten the whole bowl of it!  The nutmeg adds a nice subtle flavor.  Thanks!
268058,169475,1/14/2007,5,Made this last week- even my daughters liked it- a keeper for sure- thanks mama !
199848,169475,2/4/2007,5,MMmmm...... creamy and delicious.  I loved the flavor of the nutmeg.  I added a little sugar to the sauce and it really brought out the nutmeg very nicely.  Thanx for a great new way to prepare cabbage.  I'll use this recipe again.
236383,169475,2/8/2007,5,"We are cabbage lovers and always on the lookout for different ways to prepare. And many good recipes exist. In my view, this ranks amongst the best. Deserving of five stars for two reasons. Firstly of course, flavour and texture. I thought this might be good, that is why I tried it, but the first taste was still unexpected. Secondly, for simplicity of ingredients and preparation. It is incomprehensible that such creaminess can be achieved simply with a roux. Perhaps, my substituting with full-cream buttermilk contributed, I don't know. In any event mk, I am very grateful that you were once young, and also grateful to those Vikings - they certainly knew their cabbage! Next time, I would like to try this over fettucini."
402559,169475,4/24/2007,5,"This turned out wonderfully, thanks so much!"
329769,169475,6/18/2007,3,"*Reviewed for ZWT3*  Well, I quite liked the cabbage done this way, but personal taste wont use this recipe again. I also think that 30 minutes is too long to boil cabbage. My cabbage boiled for about 10 minutes and was quite well cooked. A nice recipe for a change, but not one I'll remake. Photo also being posted"
463202,169475,6/19/2007,3,"This recipe turned out exactly as advertised - very creamy.  It just turned out a little bland for us, not bad, just bland.  I did like the nutmeg flavor.  Maybe if I increased all the seasonings, we would like it more.  5yo DD did like it, so it is definitely one I might make again if I have cabbage to use up."
226918,169475,10/20/2007,5,"I love it!
I cooked my cabbage with a little brown sugar in the water - omitting the salt - and increased the nutmeg to about 1 1/2 tsp.
Absolutely delicious!
Will make this easy side dish often! Thanks for posting!"
37449,375775,7/15/2009,5,Very tasty salad that was very good with the Italian dressing. Thanks!
136997,169475,1/23/2008,4,"Delicious! I used a Chinese cabbage, since I like that they aren't as dense as the regular ones. I also microwaved the cabbage just until wilted. The sauce is just right. Lovely side dish. :)"
418179,169475,3/27/2008,5,"This is a great side dish! I microwaved the cabbage instead of boiling it (chop it up, place in a microwave dish with a cover & put 2 tablespoons of water in with the cabbage. Cover and Cook on high for8 minutes, stirring once in the middle of cooking) and this concentrated the sweet cabbage flavor. This is a great comfort food and I also love that it is fairly low in calories (I made it with skim milk and it was still nice and creamy). Also, I used one of the 1 pound bags of ready-cut coleslaw cabbage they have in the produce section - this adds some carrots, and it makes prep even easier."
149075,169475,1/5/2009,5,"simple and delicious. I didn't have nutmeg, but cardamon worked great as a substitute, I just used a little less to be sure it work okay."
869184,169475,1/14/2009,5,Delicious! My kids (8 and 6) were highly doubtful but I insisted that they try. They each went back to the bowl 4 times which says it all. They have already requested that I make it often. My husband who doesn't like cooked cabbage also enjoyed it. I didnt add chicken bouillion otherwise followed the recipe. Served it with mashed potatoes and meatloaf.
353131,169475,1/16/2009,5,Dh and I LOVED this recipe!! The taste was so terrific. Doesn't even taste like cabbage. Will make often
954556,169475,1/31/2009,5,"I was looking for a new veggie recipe for cabbage and this one called out to me, it looked so good!  It was just what I was looking for, something different!  We loved it and I will certainly be making this one again!"
120108,169475,9/24/2009,5,Instead of boiling the cabbage I opted to saute it lightly in the butter (using extra as needed) until it was nicely wilted. After that I followed directions as written. It's delicious. I like cabbage -- and this is a nice version of preparation! Thanks for sharing!
1432240,169475,3/7/2013,5,"This was delicious! May be just the recipe to get me to regularly enjoy cabbage. I only used 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, because I'm not usually a fan. I actually liked this amount in this dish very much."
1179225,169475,3/9/2013,3,"This was something very different for us, and was very creamy. I felt like it needed something like a little lemon to perk it up a bit. Thanks for posting the recipe."
855082,169475,10/13/2013,5,"Creamed Cabbage-Norwegian Style AND Frizzled Cabbage are my two favorite go-to cabbage recipes. &lt;br/&gt;The old, just throw cabbage into the pot of boiling meat, just doesn&#039;t cut it anymore.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for a great recipe, Hope."
1020139,169475,6/28/2015,5,"This was delicious.  I cooked the cabbage in the microwave, as another reviewer did, but mine took a little longer.  I cooked it 12 minutes instead of 8.  While the cabbage was cooking I sauteed together half of a white onion, a clove of garlic, about 1/4 of a green bell pepper, and about 1/4 of a red bell pepper until the onion started caramelizing.  I set that aside and made the roux, a bit thicker than the recipe called for because I wasn&#039;t going to drain the cabbage.  Last but not least, I change the milk to soy because I&#039;m allergic to milk.  I&#039;m sure this last made the recipe even more different, maybe a little sweeter.  After all this was done I stirred the onion mixture and the roux into the cabbage (since that was the largest pan).  I tasted it immediately, and had to serve myself up a bowl before coming and writing a review.  This is such an easy and fool-proof recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing it!"
2001009727,169475,5/13/2016,2,I love cream cabbage. I did not love this recipe.
2001436864,169475,9/19/2017,0,Fabulous! Have not had creamed cabbage like this since bestemama cooked.
102058,233050,5/28/2008,4,"Very good!  I didn't have V8 juice so used homemade vegetable stock, plus some homemade beef stock that I reduced down, and therefore omitted the beef boullion. The liquid smoke gives this an especially nice flavour and I was daring and put in a decent amount of jalapeno (the hottest I have made anything to date) and while it was firey it was wonderful too. Please see my Rating System: great taste, easy to make and I will be making this again. Thanks!"
37305,273976,12/31/2007,5,"This was the easiest sauce I ever made and the taste was uniquely delicious.  I added NOTHING except salt and pepper at the end.  I had it as is over ziti for myself and used it for Recipe #270895 for the rest of the family.  Everyone loved it; the only complaint was that it didn't make enough!  The sauce does cook down a lot, so I will double it next time. Thanks for posting this! (P.S.  I used Tuttorosso canned whole plum tomatoes.)"
157425,273976,1/18/2008,5,"The easiest tomato sauce, only 4 ingredients and tastes so good. I did double the recipe as a reviewer stated and used petite diced tomatoes. Turned this down to a very low simmer and didnt have to mash any of the tomatoes. I dont care much for the thick tomato sauces so this was a treat for me. Thank you MarraMamba!"
204024,273976,2/12/2008,5,This is very good tomato sauce. I used 1 28 oz can of chopped tomatoes with their juices. I would never have considered having just tomato sauce on my pasta until this recipe. It has sucha smooth and rich taste. Made for Please Make my Recipe.
102058,273976,2/23/2008,5,"10 Excellent stars !!! Why? because there is NO additional sugar added to this tomato sauce ... because it is so easy to prepare that I blushed when the compliments came rolling in... because the most important thing, the Taste, came though wonderfully. Please see my rating system, 5 excellent stars for a recipe that will let me use tomato sauce in a LOT of other recipes WITHOUT secretly loading up on added sugar and sabotaging my efforts to shed some kilos and lead a healthier lifestyle. Brilliant ! Thank you !"
461834,273976,3/6/2008,5,"This is wonderful, no need to buy canned tomatoe sauce anymore.  I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and the rest as stated.  The onions become so soft that is was  hard to seperate and not take alot of the sauce, so ended up leaving most of them, but I love cooked onions.  My sauce was pretty thick, probably because I used the crushed tomatoes, but still awesome in taste, and will definitely do the often for tomatoe sauce.  Thanks Marra for a great recipe!!!!"
36944,273976,3/12/2008,5,I love the simplicity of making this recipe and I was surprised at the special flavor it had.  I followed the directions exactly but left a few onions in and topped it with parmesan.  Thank you for sharing your delicious recipe MarraMamba!
369363,273976,3/31/2008,5,"I had Marcella Hazan's cookbook and somehow lost it. I absolutely love this sauce. So very simple. I used Contadina crushed tomatoes.
Had it yesterday over Gemelli pasta with a nice salad. Everyone enjoyed it.
Thank you for posting."
124416,273976,4/14/2008,5,"Brilliant!  I made it and froze it for future use.  It froze very well with no loss of quality.  Had it yesterday over some lasagna.   A great recipe.  Marra Mamba, thanks for posting.     Janet"
578914,273976,5/6/2008,5,"This was fantastic! It was so simple and perfect, we're really grateful for  the recipe. This goes in our 5 star - make again file. Thank you!"
602448,273976,5/27/2008,5,"This sauce is fabulous.  I've never really used butter in my Italian food, but this turned out really well in the sauce.  If it weren't for being less healthy than olive oil I would switch this out for my standard olive oil recipe.  I liked it as is, but I added garlic and dried basil in the end because it's just not pasta sauce for me without those flavors. Thanks for the yummy recipe though!"
197023,273976,7/25/2008,5,"SO glad to have found this wonderfully simple recipe for such a superbly flavoursome tomato sauce.  I never use the chemical-laden commercial sauces, and this so-easy-to-make recipe is so much tastier than just using a can of tomatoes.  I chopped my onion as I decided in advance to leave it in the sauce and, like MC Baker, and for the same reasons, I added garlic - 3 cloves chopped - in step two, and basil towards the end of step two.  I also added a cup of wine, as the tomatoes I use don't have a lot of liquid which is great: it leaves room for some wine!  Made for New Zaar Stars Tag.  Thank you MarraMamba for a recipe I know that I'll be using again and again.  On this occasion we used it with meatloaf."
111678,273976,7/29/2008,5,"This really shouldn't be as good as it is.  It's too simple.  But it is very, very good.  Of course I tasted it as it was simmering and thought it was good, but once it was done and sitting atop some pasta with a sprinkling of freshly-grated romano cheese--oh, my!  That's when it really became clear just what a wonderful little sauce this is.  I loved it on pasta but can also imagine it over zucchini, or fried eggplant, or herb-marinated chicken.  So simple but so delicious!  A definite keeper."
35526,273976,8/7/2008,5,"Super simple and great for lots of uses.  I add garlic sometimes, olives, leftover veggies, just about anything to make it a little different.  Freezes well too!"
259150,273976,8/29/2008,3,"Oh Marra, I so wanted to love this sauce.  I have only lived in 3 states and I have to say that the corner pizza store in each of these states has the same TOO sweet sauce that they use for all of their pasta recipes.  I like this sauce.  It did not taste bad. But I would not use it in any of my recipes that require a tomato sauce."
709498,273976,9/14/2008,5,"This truly is a very simple sauce.    I have made it twice and I love it.

The 1st time I added italian sausage and served with ziti pasta.

The 2nd time I used the sauce in my lasagna.

Since i love garlic and oregano, I added those spices, as well as a little salt and pepper.   
The sauce is delicious and tastes so fresh!
Thanks for the recipe!"
125325,273976,9/21/2008,5,I definitely loved this sauce. Too simple and too good. The butter is definitely key to the recipe. I've tried adding basil and shrimp to it. But I like it best just the way it is. Thanks so much!
486648,273976,11/15/2008,5,"I'll add to the rave reviews! This sauce is so simple, and tastes so good! I made it as written and added meatballs at the very end. I served it over spaghetti, and I have never thought spaghetti tasted so good! It's simple, but so velvety on the tongue. I used Hunts diced tomatoes, and I imagine if I used better tomatoes, I would have even better results. Regardless, I have stocked up on canned tomatoes and butter so I'll have this wonderful simple sauce available any time! The best thing of all, though, was that my kids and husband seemed to love it as much as I, that is truly a feat. Thanks so much for posting!"
68526,273976,2/25/2009,5,"Simple to make, hardly any preparation, ingredients usually on hand, what more could you ask for?  I just had to try it, and I was really pleased with the results.  The sauce has loads of flavor, and the butter is really the key, so don't leave it out or substitute anything else for it. It is awesome!  It's also great with fresh cracked black pepper, garlic and basil added too!  Thank you for sharing your recipe with us Marra!  Linda"
474322,273976,5/28/2009,5,"This is sooo easy, and the results are amazing. Vidalia onions are in season, so I used those, and a bit of fresh basil. Served over angel hair pasta,& topped with freshly grated Parmesan Reggiano, this sauce was restaurant quality! I want to try it with a few sliced mushrooms next time. Great recipe."
205783,273976,6/5/2009,5,"I brought Marcella's book via Amazon (not being from the US I didn't grow up with her books etc).  I made this sauce one night and it was amazing - we just ate it  tossed through pasta with a sprinkling of parmagiano on the top, just amazing (we also fought over the last two spoonfuls of pasta but that's a whole other story!).  This is my new standby, I use it for homemade pizza etc too as a base sauce."
120121,273976,6/6/2009,0,"Since my opinion diverges so sharply from everyone else's, it seems fairer to post a comment sans stars since it may just be my tastebuds at fault.  I used high-quality ingredients and followed directions to the letter.  But, in all honesty, this was a huge disappointment.  Despite my late efforts to salvage the sauce (adding sauteed garlic, fresh basil, a splash of balsamic vinegar and lots of freshly-grated Parmesan), it still tasted exactly like what it was -- a can of tomatoes that had been heated.  Although Marcella Hazan is a very talented chef, I would have to agree that this particular recipe is ""crazy""."
203111,273976,7/25/2009,5,"When I first saw this recipe, I wondered just how good it could be with only  3 or 4 simple ingredients.  I used a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes, which measured out to almost 2 cups.  The only onion I had was already chopped, so that's what I used, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  As someone else also mentioned, I tasted the sauce in the pan and thought it was ok.   But something happened when I put it on the spaghetti...OMG!!!!  This is absolutely wonderful!   I honestly don't think I'll ever use any other kind of sauce for my spaghetti.   Thank you for this treasure!"
118007,273976,9/12/2009,5,"This has become my favorite tomato sauce. It's great as it is, but I usually chop the onions and leave them in. You can also add some garlic and bail or parsley, though those are not necessary for a good sauce. I've also used it for spaghetti and meatballs."
226066,273976,12/21/2009,5,Was missing some tomato sauce for a recipe - so glad I found your recipe!! So easy and oh so tasty!! Only change I made was to use diced tomatoes. Thanks! :)
629291,273976,1/19/2010,5,"I have been making this for years and still love it. It's cheap, easy and delicious! I agree try it exactly as written the first time, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at how good it is like that. I think the most important thing is add enough salt/pepper ( I add a little sugar) at the beginning. It gives the extra liquid the salt creates time to cook out. I have made it and kept the onion in and and have removed it- I definitely prefer it removed as the flavor of the onion is now in the sauce and the onion is pretty flavorless by that point."
328467,273976,3/31/2010,4,"Very nice but I simply don't get the  'spectacular' reviews.  It's definitely a great recipe for a week night when you're exhausted and want to cook something fast, healthy and cheap so it gets 4 stars for that.  But the flavour doesn't come close to a traditional sauce that's simmered for a couple of hours with basil, etc. added."
880889,273976,6/25/2010,3,"I too, like rustic girl, liked the recipe but  the spectacular ratings escape me. I would much rather spend a little more time and effort and go for a fresh pommodoro sauce  or that all day gravy."
1684658,273976,9/14/2010,0,"Some of the reviewers think this sauce is overrated..but...I use this recipe for everything...and...people rave over it. My kids, co-workers & friends beg me for this sauce on angel hair pasta and lasagne. I use two large cans of Muir Glen Fire Roasted Crushed Tomatoes (whole foods & health food stores carry them) and add a pinch of sugar to tone down the acid. I then add about 1 1/2 lbs of a combination of ground beef (or ground buffalo) combined with italian sausage that has been browned in a frying pan. I pour off the juices and add to tomatoe mixture and that's it! I'm a vegetarian so I take about a cup of the tomatoe mixture out before adding meats. It's wonderful on angel hair pasta!"
449102,273976,9/28/2010,5,"This is the most luscious, delicious, pleasing tomato sauce I know of. Specifically, I use a 28 ounce can of whole peeled san marzano tomatoes, 5 tbsp salted butter (and I don't add additional salt), and a halved onion. There is nothing more pleasing than this sauce lightly coated on al dente pasta. Perfection."
312322,24550,4/17/2008,5,"Excellent Pesach cookies.
I  used 2.5 cups regular matza meal with a half cup coconut.
Baked for 20 minutes.
Made 40 cookies.
My 16 year old son says you can't tell they are Pesach cookies."
1730315,273976,11/14/2010,5,"I guess all along the secret ingredient was butter.  Who knew?   I made a much larger quantity of this and added pine nuts and capers to the sauce.  I did her recipe with the halved onion.  I put the sauce over pasta with shrimp and mussels. That's what we had for dinner tonight.  Maybe now, since I can make a great sauce, I can save money on going out to eat in the quest for the perfect sauce."
482242,273976,4/3/2011,0,"I made this last night, and is getting 4 stars rather than 5 because I added things against the advice of the chef. I added garlic salt, basil and oregano. I also had made meatballs earlier in the day. I simmered these in the sauce for last 20 minutes. I used 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can whole plum tomatos. I will be making this again to have with my cheese stuffed shells and will be making as directed. I think I would have given this a 5 star rating if I had left it alone. I regretted the add ins once sauce was simmering a while and I saw where it was going, but too late I a had already added stuff. I will review again after I make the stuffed shells. This was wonderful to make, even though I had to make it after work. Few ingredients, and able to pretty much able to just let simmer while other things got done. I just wish I had left alone, and had been able to truly enjoy the flavors as they should have been. But I will be making this again most definetly"
418017,273976,10/12/2011,3,"I just made this this morning and had it over ravioli.  I used a can of Cento San Marzano tomatoes (label said product of Italy).<br/>This was not fabulous, OK but not outstanding.  I think when using canned tomatoes, even San Marzano, the butter should be increased.  The tinny tomato taste was there and it was acidic.  But I now realize why the owner of a restaurant used to put pats of butter when heating sauce for an order.<br/>I have been know to take canned tomato sauce, add some butter and chicken broth (Better than Bouillon), a pinch of basil and use that for ravioli.  <br/>I will try this again, when I can get some good tomatoes.  I don't think the canned does it justice."
1365025,273976,11/5/2012,5,"I had a ton of yellow tomatoes that hadn't turn yellow yet after the weather turned cold so I brought them into the house to vine ripen. After cooking them I put them through the food mill. To this I added the butter, garlic and onion salt, oregano, basil, salt, parsley and cayenne pepper. I simmered this for several hours. I like my sauce a little thicker so I added some cornstarch to just thicken enough to coat the spoon. Wow was this good. The secret is definitely the butter. I usually add a couple Tablespoons of butter to my gravies and soups but never thought of adding it to the tomato sauce. Thank you so much for posting. I promised next time I'll make it as written."
2044948,273976,12/8/2012,4,"I really enjoyed this sauce - it's light and a bit plain, but that's what I enjoyed most about it as the sauce was not the focal point of my meal.  Definitely something easy to throw together on a weeknight.  Thanks for sharing!"
47570,273976,8/31/2013,5,Reasons for the 5 star:  Tasted great.  Inexpensive.&lt;br/&gt;I enjoyed the flavor immensely. It did not taste like tomatoes out of the can to me - I&#039;ve made enough sauces that have. &lt;br/&gt;In this time of needing to extend our budgets - a can of tomatoes plus a little butter made into a great meal? Who can complain?
318262,273976,8/22/2014,5,"This was wonderful and so simple. The extra cooking time really turns the tomatoes from acidic to sweet. Lovely sauce, thank you!"
226753,273976,12/26/2014,5,"Simple, straight-forward, no skill required.   I had very unpleasant metallic-tasting results with Cento brand tomatoes, but the San Marzano tomatoes (with the white label) work for me every time.  I make no changes until the end, when I add a generous squirt of the pulverized Italian herbs that come in a tube in the produce case   (just like Grandma....)    No matter what I put this sauce on - pasta, frittata, calamari, store-bought! meatballs - my husband seems surprised at how good it tastes and suggests that I make it again.  Either the stuff is very versatile, or his memory is even worse than I thought.    Freezes well, too.   The sauce...not the husband..."
2000293071,273976,6/24/2015,1,"You think this sauce is easy? Sure.  But going to the store and buying a can of SpaghettiOs will provide you with the same flavor and is even easier. 

This sauce is a disgrace. Remember on the riveting show called &#039;Honey Boo Boo&#039; when they mix ketchup and butter together to make their sauce?  Same thing here. 

Never trust a cook that dislikes garlic."
2000398101,273976,8/11/2015,5,"I&#039;ve been cooking this sauce occasionally for years. It is simple and delicious and the flavour is wonderful. This is NOT a sauce to use in other recipes, it is only for simply combining with pasta. I have the cookbook it&#039;s from and this is very clear in that (Marcella is always very clear, her tone is like a fairly strict schoolteacher I always think!). The recent comment comparing this sauce to Honey Boo Boo&#039;s &quot;sketi&quot; is purely idiotic and inappropriate - Marcella Hazan is about as far away from that as you can get. Also, Marcella does not dislike garlic but like most traditional Italian cooks she does not combine onion and garlic in a pasta sauce - it&#039;s one or the other."
268611,273976,8/11/2018,0,"Made this today but I used fresh heirloom tomatoes from my garden. Normally, the acidity would need balancing but this recipe is perfection. I believe the butter gave it all the balance it needed. I added meat balls in the last 15 minutes and my husband cried a little tear of joy."
599450,277658,1/28/2008,5,"Wow! Who'd have thunk this would be such an outstanding recipe cooked in a microwave! I'd give this 6 or 7 stars if 'Zaar supported that many. These custards came out not only pretty, but delicious. Thanks, Michelle_My_Belle! Made for Newest Zaar Tag 08A game."
557801,277658,8/27/2008,4,"We loved the custards, and we loved the mushrooms--we just weren't so sure about the two together, so I have to give 4 stars.  My husband and I would both like to have these again.  I think I'd like to make the mushrooms as an appetizer, but leave them whole instead of slicing.  The corn custard was amazing.  I couldn't believe it came together so quickly, and came out as smooth as it did in the microwave.  My husband wouldn't let me put cayenne in them.  He was afraid it would get too spicy, so we just put in a couple dashes of chili powder for a milder flavor.  Thanks!  Made for 'Please review my Recipe"" tag.

Oh!  A tip for cutting the corn off the cob--flip a custard cup or similar container upside down inside of a large bowl.  Put the base of the corn cob on the custard cup, standing it up on end.  Holding on to the top (skinny end) of the cob, carefully slice the kernels off.  They fall into the bowl instead of splattering and flying all over the place!  I just read this tip somewhere recently, but can't remember where, so I can't even give credit!"
636313,286223,12/17/2008,5,"For a healthier version, try baking instead of frying.  It is just as yummy without the grease!"
743849,346728,1/8/2009,5,"These biscuits were great!  They didn't rise much (as you can see from the photo), but they were still light and delicious!  I served them warm from the oven.  Made for New Kids On The Block Tag Game 1/8/09."
897568,346728,5/2/2011,0,"These turned out really well.  Mine actually rose quite a bit though, sorry, no picture!  Will be making again."
1620346,431267,1/2/2018,0,Good but like more vegetables
13483,20701,1/19/2004,5,Excellent dish.  I did marinade the shrimp about 24 hours.  Cooked as described and added some red pepper flakes.  Used extra garlic too.  Easy and simple to do.
496803,20701,5/29/2008,0,"I made this for my surf and turf dinner last weekend.  I marinated fro 24 hours, and included the spices in the marinade, rather than adding at cooking time.  This was very easy, and I'll definately use the method again, as the shrimp were tender and perfectly cooked.  My only complaint was that the cumin seemed to be a really odd taste with the shrimp, but only when they were hot.  I had the leftovers as a cold snack the next day, and the flavor was fine.  I think this would be great over pasta, but I'll omit the cumin next time.  Thanks for posting!"
212600,24550,4/28/2005,5,"These are really good cookies.  Crunchy but chewy inside, everyone loved them.  I didn't have matza farfel, so I crushed about 3-4 matzas and used those instead. I was worried that the batter was a little crumbly, but the cookies came out great.
Recipe yielded about four dozen cookies."
296546,24550,4/11/2006,4,After mixing all of the ingredients I found it to be a little too crumbly to scoop. So I poured it into a pan and pressed it into bar cookies!  The kids loved them! I did omit the raisins and nuts and add an extra cup of chocolate chips at the kids' request (don't know if that's what changed the texture???). I will make another batch tonight according to the recipe to bring to the in-laws for Passover! Thanks for a SUPER EASY recipe!
162304,24550,4/28/2006,5,"Thank you so much for the recipe! I could not find matzah meal, so I bought matzah crackers and crumbled them. It was tough figuring out the number of crackers, so I just kept adding them until the mixture was able to form mounds. These cookies got the BEST reviews at Passover!!! I was pleasantly surprised and would make them really anytime of year. Thanks again!"
350812,24550,4/2/2007,5,"Five stars as Passover good goes - but still not the ""real"" thing!  I'll def pull this out next year, but will stick to my original choc chip cookies throughout the year.  I used semi-sweet chips and increased the eggs to 3...might even consider 4 for next year.  I used a scoop and sometimes had to squeeze the cookies together.  I found that rounded drops worked MUCH better than flattened ones.  Thanks for sharing!"
269480,24550,4/19/2008,4,"Thanks for the delicious cookies. These taste really good like store bought Pesach ones.  DH wasn't impressed, but I was.  Forming the doughs took time though, had to use my hand in molding them squeezing them real hard for them to stick. Made 40 cookies."
69303,24550,4/23/2008,5,These cookies were so crunchy and a great alternative to the store-bought passover cookies which are a fortune and not nearly as good as this recipe! I left out the raisins and put in more walnuts and chocolate chips to compensate. I'm not a big fan of raisins in cookies unless they are oatmeal!
364186,24550,4/9/2009,5,"These cookies were really great, and well-received.  Exactly what I was looking for to bring to the seder.  Three different people asked me for the recipe!  I substituted dried cherries for the raisins, which added a pleasing tartness to the bittersweet chocolate chips.  One thing:  I used *heaping* tablespoons to drop the batter, and this recipe easily yielded 36 cookies."
970032,24550,4/12/2009,5,I was really surprised.  My picky husband and I loved these cookies.  My hubby does not eat raisins or walnuts so I did 11/2 bittersweet chocolate and 1 1/2 dried cherries (Thanks 364186). I then cut the recipe in half and added walnuts to my half.  His were flatter like regular chocolate chips but mine were just like the photo.  Thank You for the wonderful treat we will have them again during the year.
528006,24550,4/13/2009,5,Wow!  Very unusual texture - like nothing I've ever had before.  These were so good that I'd try them without the chocolate chips!
1448072,24550,4/5/2010,5,"Great Passover cookie recipe!  I replaced the nuts with 1/2 cup  mixed fruit and 1/2 cup chocolate chips as my son does not like nuts in baked goods.  I baked for only 12 minutes as we don't like too crispy cookies.  The taste and texture were excellent.  Nice crunch on the outside, softer on the inside, especially right out of the oven.  No problems scooping batter.  I used generous tablespoons and got 50 good sized cookies.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's going into the Passover file and will use it again next year.  A winner!!"
583643,24550,4/9/2012,4,"This dough is really crumbly and thus not conducive to stress cooking, but it's great alternative to macaroons."
231736,24550,4/3/2015,5,"These were amazingly un-matzoh flavored after baking.  I added some coconut to the mixture just because I had some on hand, and otherwise followed the directions.  I mixed the dough by hand and I think that helped it hold together when scooping.  Also, I didn&#039;t use boxed matzoh farfel but instead used three matzohs and crushed them by hand.  This way I can make the pieces a bit smaller than the boxed farfel, which I think makes them blend in better.  

THE YIELD INFO IS WAY OFF!  I made large cookies (I baked for 17-18 minutes) and easily got 4 dozen from the recipe.  A very good recipe that is not disappointing as some Passover desserts are.  Thanks!"
1667251,24550,4/23/2016,4,I used cherry flavored craisins and made 36 crunchy cookies.
50643,28830,8/19/2002,5,OMG. Outstanding and totally amazed. My husband and I love our veggies. This is full of our favorite summer vegetables. The fresh basil puts it over the top.  Very well seasoned and colorful too. Just sorry it took me til the end of summer to find this. Thanks Nurse Di.
72424,28830,4/23/2003,5,"My husband and I thought this was a great pasta salad. We liked the oven roasted eggplant. Also, the lemony-basil flavor was very refreshing. Only thing I added was more salt. Salads like this make eating healthy not so painful. Thanks Nurse Di."
140271,28830,9/8/2008,3,"This was good...just good, not outstanding. I agree that it needed more salt. I thought the flavors came together okay, but there was something lacking."
46545,34741,8/16/2002,5,"Everyone in my family loves this bread!!
I made it in a large jelly roll pan and put different toppings on each half, so it was like having 2 flavors.  Had to cook it twice as long and it never got golden.  Next time I'll make it with 2 pans so the bread is thinner.   THANKS for a family favorite."
35635,34741,8/17/2002,0,"This does make a lot. My large pizza pan is really big, as is my rectangular pan... I think that a jelly roll pan is too small. OOPS I should probably have indicated this...

The cheese on top is what should make it golden. It always has for me.

Also,it makes up nice as a bread loaf too (cooking time will change)..."
57397,34741,2/25/2003,5,"oh man!! This focaccia is INCREDIBLE!!!  I divided my dough up into two cookie tray.  I didn't have any garlic powder, so I minced up a head of garlic really fine and added it into the bread maker along with the flour and everything else.  

As for topping, I added some tomato paste, Mirj's Oven-Dried Tomatoes #14681, more minced garlic, some minced onion, mushrooms, and a generous sprinkle of oregano and basil and popped it into the oven.  Once the bread was done, I turned off the oven, and just added a couple of thinly sliced processed cheese on the top.  

Eating it while I am reviewing it...best focaccia ever!! I think I will go home and make another batch, don't think it will last the day.  Darn should have brought more to work.  "
37106,34741,3/16/2003,5,"This bread is fantastic! This is my second time I have made it and did not realize I had not review before. Yes it makes alot but believe me it does not go to waste. A gooey mess when making but the smells just from the dough is enough to make it worth it, then wait till you actually bake this bread the aroma is all over the house and it is wonderful, only second to the taste. Obiously a winner and will be made again & again in this house."
75449,34741,11/21/2003,5,"Awesome bread.  It was so easy and the results were so great!  I made the bread recipe exactly, but I didn't have any parmesan and I didn't use any additional toppings.  It was still so good!  I'm going to buy parmesan today for the next time I make it, which will be very soon.  Thanks Pixie!  "
137191,34741,8/27/2004,5,"Fantastic!  My 10-year old daughter made this bread with tomatoes, black olives and cheddar cheese.  We loved the soft texture and spice mix in the bread and on top.  We submitted a picture of the bread on a cooling rack that hopefully will be posted soon."
237330,34741,6/13/2007,5,"This is a recipe that makes me so thankful I have a bread machine! I probably wouldn't make focaccia without it but I will be making this focaccia often. Excellent and easy! I added the full amount of water right at the beginning...it made for a sticky dough in the end but your suggestion to oil your hands took care of that. To slightly lower the fat I used very little olive oil to top the bread and then just parmesan cheese and chives from my garden. For my personal taste I will reduce the amount of onion and garlic powder next time. I would make a meal out of this adding just a salad with some protein. Thank you, Pixie, for a fabulous keeper recipe!"
39754,34741,9/16/2007,5,"I halved the recipe and added the extra water at the begining, set my breadmaker to dough setting and let it get on with it. Turned out wonderful, well risen, great crust. This time I made it with just the basic toppings, next time I will add a few add-ons. Great recipe Pixie, thanks for sharing

Edited to say I have made this again at the weekend and used it like pizza dough and put the traditional tomato and cheese topping and it was fantastic!!  A definate keeper"
88099,34741,11/29/2008,5,Excellent Focaccia Bread.  I followed the recipe to a T and it came out perfect.  Dough was easy to work with.  My house smelled so good while this was cooking.  My topping was a simple just Kosher Salt and Parmesan Cheese.  Made to go with recipe #339948  Thanks Pixie.  :)
394077,34741,12/28/2008,5,"Since I don't have a bread machine,  I made it by hand.  I used only 3 1/2 cup of flour.  The dough is a dream to work with.  I forgot the 3 Tablespoons water step but it still came out great .  The bread came out nice and soft.  My crust didn't come out crispy but soft also.  For topping, I brushed mine with olive oil, sprinkle on 1 teaspoon of Kosher salt,  and added some crushed oregano. So tasty.  Thank you for a great recipe."
155937,74231,12/1/2004,5,"This is a surprisingly good recipe. The molasses makes for a sweet, flavorful chili without a strong tomato flavor. I did not have hot chili powder on hand, so I used extra chili powder to spice it up a bit. The addition of lemon juice and parsley at the end really enhances the mild flavors of this chili. I am making another batch to freeze. Thank you for a wonderful low-fat recipe! "
39823,74231,1/5/2006,5,"This was great and low in fat, just what I needed. I added a bay leaf and some hot sauce. Thanks it was great and will put it in my cook book.
                Ciao"
135511,74231,2/7/2006,3,"We all enjoyed this dinner.  I think next time I will use a little extra chilli powder like some others have for ""more"" chilli taste. Thanks"
298734,74231,3/26/2006,4,"My wife said that ""it's a nice change of pace from the ordinary chili taste: nuanced and slightly sweet.""  I say it was good and satisfying but maybe use more tomatoes next time.  The wife disputes this since I used twice as much turkey as the recipe called for.  We served this over a bed of brown rice and had a 2003 Kaiken Malbec to accompany the meal.  The wine had lots of flavor and was a little bit spicy in a cinnamon/black pepper kiind of way.  It didn't marry with the food perfectly but it didn't conflict with it either."
218859,74231,7/6/2007,4,I really enjoyed this - lots of rich flavor.  Doesn't taste low fat.
1335850,74231,8/22/2009,5,I am not the biggest Chili fan but this was really great.  I loved that it was sweet and the carrots were really unique.  I am definately going to repeat this recipe!
1157454,74231,9/25/2009,5,"This recipe was yummy! Even my picky 11 year old who never eats beans (and his friend who was over at our house) raved about the chili! My husband liked it, too! I was surprised that the Molasses did not make the chili taste too sweet! I actually sauteed the onion, garlic and carrots together first, and used cilantro instead of parsley. Will definetely make this again!"
1517847,74231,1/26/2010,5,"This chili recipe was really flavorful. I was a little nervous about trying it because it's so different from what I normally do, but it really was delicious and satisfying. I made it last night and found myself wishing I had bought more beans so I could make another batch tonight."
325154,84567,7/26/2009,5,"This is a truly delicious dessert for company or ""just because""!"
42407781,84567,12/22/2015,5,"For some reason the helpful formatting doesn&#039;t show up on my tablet so I&#039;m posting this for anyone else who might have a similar issue...
Bottom layer: cream cheese, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 egg.
Top layer: pecan pieces, 3 eggs, corn syrup, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 cup sugar."
1680722,184915,3/27/2011,5,"Hobbyzu! I had to discover your recipe soooooo many years after posting this recipe and it's soooo a fantastic recipe. <br/>We enjoyed this dish like something holy! It was sooooo wonderful tasty and delicious!<br/>I prepared some homemade bread (my Recipe #449099). This was a perfect combination with the tasty sauce of your chicken.<br/>I had chicken with preserved lemons and olives in Fes (Marocco) and I prepared this several times without any recipe. Today I tried to find one in food.com and I found your recipe!<br/>Very similar to mine, but much more complete and tasty.<br/>Indeed, I did some changes: ground ginger instead of fresh one and from the beginning all the ingredients directly together.<br/>Please, please post more recipes!"
474170,209718,3/30/2007,5,"This is definitely one of the better pie crusts I've had since becoming GF. I had a hard time making an attractive top crust from it, but for a bottom crust it was perfect."
802773,209718,11/28/2010,4,"Thanks for sharing!  This is one of the best GF alternatives I've tried so far--and I've tried several.  What I like is that the dough is easy to work with even though sealing the partially rolled out dough in plastic was a bit challenging.  Compared to most GF pie crusts, this one was easier to handle and didn't break up when putting it in the pan.  Plus, the butter definitely gives it added flavor.  I would have given it 5 stars if it was flakier or at least a bit more tender (so I could easily cut it with a fork or butter knife).  I'll be making it again to see if I can improve on the tenderness."
578749,272489,10/4/2008,5,I love this recipe.  I had this a few years ago and then lost it.  Love the flavoring and it is so easy to make!
694336,272489,11/12/2009,5,"LOVE this dish!!  So hearty and delicious, but so easy to make!  My kids love this meal and ask for it frequently.  My only modification is that I use a pie crust on the bottom, and cover the entire top with Pillsbury big and buttery croissants, rolled out flat to seal the perforations.  Thanks so much for sharing!!"
169712,272489,9/21/2010,4,"I adjusted this abunch-- to take advantage of ingredients I already had, to simplify the steps, and to make the recipe vegetarian.  I mixed the Alfredo sauce, vegetables (adding some thawed sweet corn), some chicken substitute, and the milk in a bowl, then poured the mixture directly into the pan.  I covered the pan in foil and baked for 20 minutes.  At the end of 20 minutes, I uncovered the pan and moved it to the bottom shelf of the oven, and baked a can of biscuits on the middle shelf. Delicious! And simple. I will definitely make it this way again."
58104,299849,7/6/2010,5,"Refreshingly great! In the middle of a heat wave and this fits the bill. Made with home grown tomatoes, cukes, basil. I also used home grown garlic chives in place of the green onion. Skipped the salt. Used home made poppy seed dressing adding the basil and vinegar. Thanks!"
33188,58224,7/30/2004,5,These are so good!! My family devoured them - it's so easy to make! i agree with ReeLani - it is very addicting to sample while it's cooking! i did add 4 cloves of garlic (we love garlic)and some minced onion (on the side) - will definitely make again and again! Thanks!
469903,317942,8/23/2008,5,"Never in my life have I had a jello shot like this! It was different from the usual fruity jello shots I've done in the past.  Of course chocolate covered cherries are one of my favorites, so I could be a little biased here.  Anyway, I did half of the recipe below - its easy to make and went over well for the Packer party we had last night. Yum!!"
144490,317942,8/24/2008,4,"We were having a block party with lots of people around so I couldn't resist this recipe. They were lots of fun. I don't think of myself as the Jello shot kind of gal...these far exceeded my expectations. I could only find .3 ounce size boxes of Jello so that is what I used. I think I may have preferred leaving out the extra unflavored gelatin. I wanted the Jello to be softer like a chocolate covered cherry. Also, as pretty as the cherry was on top, it would have been easier to ""shoot"" if it had had been pitted and put in with the Jello mixture to set up. They had a great flavor though. I would do them again. Very nice entry."
464080,317942,10/3/2008,5,Made 5 different jello shots and these were the most creative and most impressive.  We will be having these at a Bachelorette party this weekend and I promise to get a good photo of a shot with whipped cream and chocolate on top for you!!!  I did substitute Starbucks coffee flavored liqueur for the coffee in the recipe. . .DELISH!
1092347,317942,7/6/2009,5,"I made these for our 4th of July party - they were great! One guy said they were like a little dessert treasure bite! Pretty good when even the guys like them. They were the 1st to dissapear. The other kind I made had Amaretto and they were very good also, just not as good as these were. Oh, and I put the Marischino cherry inside, and on top! Definetly a FIVE STAR!!"
711724,317942,12/31/2010,4,These are a great idea for flavor. I didn't like the extra unflavored gelatin. Next time I'll leave it out b/c even with the smallest amount suggested they were too firm. I substituted the Starbucks coffee liqeur as well. The flavor was great!!! Love the whipped cream and the cherry!!
599450,350602,10/3/2009,5,"This is such delicious comfort food and worth every bit of work. I had difficulty staying away from a second serving. I love the veggies in this. Thanks, quikgourmet, for a casserole I will make often! Made for PAC Fall 2009."
107583,418131,9/14/2012,5,"Very refreshing.  Only change I made was to cut the amount of sugar in half, and it was still plenty sweet."
524381,23909,2/19/2008,5,Very easy and very tasty!  The caraway seeds are a really nice addition!  I used very large chops and my 2.5 year old ate a whole one!  This one will be a regular for us!  Thanks!
990914,23909,1/16/2010,0,"I used your recipe to do some crockpot chops. Skipped the carrots, added one thin sliced apple, can of sauerkraut, small handful of barley, onion,caraway and a bottle of hard apple cider. Cooked on low 6-7 hours and a definate keeper."
412162,23909,9/17/2012,4,"I made this a few days ago, but in a deep dish casserole in the oven.  I did not use carrots (although they'd probably be very good in it).  I added two apples, large slices, and sprinkled about 2 tablespoons of brown suger over all.  Then instead of apple juice, I poured the drained sauerkraut juice over all.  Also added about 3/4 tsp of black pepper.  <br/><br/>With a side of homemade mashed potatoes, this dish is to die for!"
33443,58224,3/21/2004,5,"This was easy, delicious, and extremely versatile. I can see endless options with this baby.This time I served it on toasted Kaiser buns. Cayenne amount was just right for me, but I added 2 cloves of garlic but will add more next time (personnal preference). I had a medium cheddar, so that's what i used."
28346,58224,7/11/2004,5,"Yummm!!  I sampled this a few times as it was cooking and didn't think I would find it too fascinating, but once it was done I found myself quickly addicted!  I had mine plain on a plate with no starches, but a good crusty roll would have been an excellent accompaniment.  I'll be sharing some of this with my mom, and I know she'll share my opinion.  "
186771,73513,5/2/2005,5,I was delighted to see this traditional Bulgarian shopska salad recipe. For a bit more tanginess the original recipe (as it is done in Bulgaria) calls for a dash of wine vinegar. Thanks for posting.
115053,58224,8/18/2004,4,"This was great.  I halved the recipe for just my bf and I, he loved it.  Don't all guys love beef?  I added a little more cayenne and half a yellow onion while browning the meat.  We ate this on low-fat wheat buns. Lots of leftovers! Delicious!  Definitely a summer must have!"
101823,58224,9/25/2004,4,"This was a cheesy twist on sloppy joes.  It made a very easy week-night dinner served on toasted buns with oven fries, cottage cheese, and sliced tomatoes.  I added diced onion as I browned the beef and used Lawry's seasoned salt instead of regular.  My hubby ate some of the leftovers with tortilla chips as a hot-hamburger dip.  "
42720,58224,5/29/2005,5,"Boy was this a treat!  Bye bye, sloppy joes - hello ""immoral"" loose meat!! My dh and son and I all loved this stuff.  Okay, I have to confess I added some chopped onion while browning the meat.  I can't help it, I just love onion.  If anyone is leery of trying this because of the beer - don't be! You will be surprised at the wonderful flavor it imparts as it cooks away.  I served this open-faced on toasted hamburger buns.  Great easy meal for busy weeknights or anytime.
"
60992,58224,6/3/2005,4,"A confession, I liked this much better luke warm....on a toasted bun it reminded me of a meatloaf sandwich. I followed directions to the ""T"" and it took approximately 1 hour to cook down. It made a great weeknight dinner with chips and dip and slaw. And I liked it because it made enough to freeze half for future use."
114681,58224,4/10/2006,4,"My daughters boyfriend is from Iowa and loves ""Maidrites"" but this wasn't exactly what I remebered.  I combined then a couple of recipe's as when I first tasted the hamburg mixture I knew it wasn't right.  Omitted this recipe sugar and added 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 1 can of sloppy joe mix, dark beer,and used veveeta instead of american cheese.  Turned out great, a little on the sweeter side.    "
196198,58224,9/18/2006,2,These were a little close to what I grew up eating Maid-Rites in my hometown in Ohio.  The Maid-Rite restaurant opened in the 1940's.  Rumor has it that the ground beef is steamed in beer.  What I don't like about these is the garlic in them.  
130219,58224,10/3/2006,4,"I used to drive 2 hours to Ohio to get these loose meat hamburgers called Maid Rite. Now I can make them any time I want. These are GREAT! The only change I made was adding some fine diced onion to my hamburger as it fried and cut the recipe by 1/3 since I only had 1 pound of hamburger. This made enough for 5 hamburgers for us. Thanks for posting this one, I will be making often. Served with chips and cold beer. Yum, yum, yum."
134011,58224,12/9/2006,5,This recipe ROCKS!!!  Yum-oh!  The kids loved it as is...the big kids loved it with a splash of peri-peri hot sauce over the top.  Cheers ThatBobbieGirl!  Thanks for sharing
86635,58224,1/21/2007,5,"Being from Alabama, I had never heard of these. They truly are awesome. So easy! I can't say if they are true to the midwest way of making, but they are a new favorite here in Birmingham. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!!"
524427,58224,6/25/2007,5,"I liked this so much I registered just so I could comment on it. I wanted to have cheeseburgers tonight, but I didn't want to have the mess that goes with them. This recipe was perfect, and the seasonings are just right. Would give it 10 stars if I could!"
424672,58224,7/13/2007,2,"My fiance, who is not hard to please, said, ""um, its not that great."" We were both kind of grossed out by the creamy liquid that accompanied it, but we ate it anyway. I was very thankful that I sauteed some onion separately and then added it to the mixture. And thank God I had some pickles on hand, because at my first bite, it was very obvious that they were missing from the equation."
313939,58224,7/21/2007,5,"Very Very good!  I had to add onions of course, The only other changes I made was a little smoked paprika for color and smokey flavor, and pre-shredded cheese because I'm a caterer, and like to take any short cuts possible.  But the changes were good, and I think the recipe would be excellent without them also.  I've moved it to my ""Stuff we like"" cookbook.  Thanks TBG for another keeper!"
44642,58224,7/27/2007,1,"Sorry...We just did not care for this. I did add a onion and hot pepper flakes. But has my Dh said this taste as weird as it looks.
But he ate it LOL.But that is the fun of cooking, trying something new.I did cut the recipe to 6serv.
And some times that does not work.
thanks,Bobbie Girl"
1132039,58224,8/11/2010,4,"This was great!  I didn't have venison burger, but I had stew meat, so I used that.  I added an onion as well and sautéed it with the garlic before browning the meat.  I used a Guinness extra stout and it turned out wonderful!  Kind of like a Cottage Pie since I served it over roughly mashed yukon gold potatoes.  When most of the liquid had evaporated I added a tablespoon of flour and made a gravy.  I added sharp cheddar, but it didn't make much of a difference for my dish.  It was mainly the Guinness that gave it flavor.  I love the flexibility of this recipe!  I'll definitely be making it again!"
96177,58224,5/2/2011,5,"OUt of this world!!! So much better than the typical burger. We had friends over for dinner last night. Three decided on a grilled burger and two of us chose the ""Immoral Burger"". Guess what we fed to the cats? Yep.. the grilled burgers. Thanks for sharing a super recipe. They are great served with dill pickle and chopped onion and most certainly on a nice soft white bun."
101432,58224,9/14/2012,5,"This was really a very nice change from plain burgers! I had only 3/4 lb of beef to use up, and I was able to cut the recipe down perfectly.  I used brown mustard (all I had) and just a small squirt of ketchup (for my hubby's taste), but everything else was to the letter.  I steamed a couple hoagie buns on top of the meat and topped our big sandwiches with American cheese and dill pickles.  It was WONDERFUL!  Thanks for a great recipe!"
37779,58224,2/21/2015,0,"Delicious sandwich. Salt and pepper amounts used--2 t. salt, 1 t. coarse black pepper. Served on lightly toasted buns spread w/ yellow mustard and added dill pickles slices on top. I love the cheese slices melted into the ground beef. A quick and easy supper for us. Thanks for sharing."
2000498330,58224,4/26/2016,5,Wonderful tangy sloppy sandwich.
86318,61944,6/10/2008,3,"I'm trying to decide whether to call this 3 or 4 stars, but think I'll go with 3. I halved the recipe, but did not change any ingredients or proportions. I quite liked it. However I have liked every oyster dish I have ever eaten, and I do not think I will make this again. It came out very bready (yes, you can tell that from the amount of bread crumbs, it's true), and also very rich with so much butter and oil. I think it must be like ""oyster dressing"" which I have heard about. If I were to make it again I would cut the butter and oil in half, at least. I would also probably reduce the bread crumbs somewhat. Thank you for an interesting experience."
93095,68458,9/7/2003,5,"This is an excellent pasta dish.  I made a few adjustments to fit my tastes, I used 2 cans of the beans, 1 can of black olives instead of green, and I left out the cheese (I'm not a big cheese fan).  I also cut up 1 large fresh tomato and added it along with the canned.  Great recipe! "
108072,68458,10/23/2003,4,I was a bit skeptical but the bean/olive combo was excellent.  Using fresh tomatoes made it wonderful.
452467,68458,2/21/2007,5,"I added two fresh tomatoes in addition to the canned, and a lot of rosemary.  Also left out the cheese. Was wonderful!"
134903,68458,4/13/2009,4,The fam loved it!  Made it with the kalamata olives & feta.  Excellent flavor combination . . . but felt like it needed a little extra punch for my taste.
179133,68458,3/24/2010,5,"This was very tasty! This was just the recipe I needed today as it finished up some ingredients I needed to use! I halved the recipe and used fresh tomatoes, fresh parsley, and kalamata olives. My tomatoes were very juicy so I cooked the sauce a few minutes longer to thicken it some. I highly recommend using the feta garnish, as it really brought everything together. Thanks so much for the recipe!"
32772,69134,8/21/2003,5,"This is a Tried and True Recipe. A great side dish for your favorite meat. The blend of vinegar, sugar and bacon adds a sweet and sour taste. Thanks for a great recipe."
47510,69134,8/30/2003,3,"This was just a little too sweet and sour for our tastes.  We thought the vinegar and sugar totally overwhelmed the taste of the green beans.  If I make this again, I'll cut down on the amounts of sugar and vinegar. "
29196,72904,9/16/2004,4,"These were good. Simplle and easy to prepare. i forgot the cayene, but otherwise made the recipe as stated. Thanks."
130663,72904,9/17/2004,5,"We had these tonight for dinner and they,re good and easy to make "
145223,72904,1/16/2005,5,"This one is a keeper in my house. Even my 3 1/2 yr. old grandson....who can be picky about potatoes ( his favorites are french fries and mashed potaoes ) had 4 helpings ! 
  I left out the cayenne. wasn't a problem leaving it out.
   A simple and easy and tasty recipe....thanks keen5."
354019,72904,2/15/2007,4,"Excellent! Great taste and
easy recipe. thankyou!"
65720,72904,4/30/2007,5,This is a wonderful potato dish! A friend gave me the recipe several years ago and I've since made them quite ofter for dinners and everyone has loved them. Thanks for saving me the time to type this out! :)
4470,72904,5/12/2008,5,"Excellent flavor & so easy to make.  I got everything ready in the AM, placed the sliced potatoes in cold water so the wouldn't discolor, sliced the onions, covered them, measured out the cheese etc. An hour before dinner I dried the potatoes assembled the pie - popped it into the oven and there it was golden & ready to serve 45 minutes later.  I cut the recipe back to 3 sevings"
124876,72904,6/9/2008,5,"I really like a recipe that survives the leftover process. These were great the first time around and subsequently, reheated in the nuke, just as good with another meal. Thanks keen5 for a great side dish."
824052,72904,1/16/2014,5,"This was very good and so easy to make.  I didn&#039;t use any measurements.  I just sliced, layered.  I used the grated parmesan cheese in the bottle. It  came out just fine. I will definitely make again."
29196,73513,7/7/2004,4,"This was a lovely fresh tasting salad. I used no salt, kleaving it up to everyone to salt it at the table. That brings all the flavours out. Next time I would reduce the parsley to about 3 tablespoons, and the spring onions to about 4 (our jaws got a good workout;-) )"
88276,73513,7/27/2004,4,"I made this the night before it was to be served, and if anyone else had the same idea, I would suggest not adding the tomatoes until the next day, as their juices drain out and form a puddle.  I, too, used four spring onions and about a quarter cup of parsley.  I love how the salad did not need a dressing because all the flavours from the different vegetables marinated together overnight!  I think, though, that unless this is a main dish salad, it would serve maybe six instead of four."
19540,89503,5/7/2004,5,"Amanda has it just right  -- tender on the inside, crispy on the outside. Easy, quick and really, really good. Forget McNuggets. Go for these! I made it exactly as it's written and it came out just right. Took a little longer to cook, though, but that's probably because I doubled the recipe. This is a keeper."
91392,89503,5/30/2004,5,"Will never fry nuggests in oil again!  This was fast, good and easy to clean up cooked on parchment paper.  A real winner!"
116939,89503,6/1/2004,5,These were so easy to make and I followed the recipe. So simple to bake and clean up was a breeze! This is a keeper for sure! Thanks amanda!
108843,89503,6/19/2004,5,"Very easy to make. I followed the recipe, exactly. Tastes great, cleanup was a breeze."
146394,89503,8/3/2004,5,"Wonderful and so easy!
I love it! Dh loved it too! I had added parm cheese and oregano for a twist. The cheese made it a little harder to eat with your fingers but tasted great! I love this recipe!"
148221,89503,8/11/2004,5,"Definitely a five star recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly but the strips took 30 minutes instead of 10 to bake.  This tasted soooo good for being baked, not fried; my whole family loved it.  Thanks for a great chicken strip recipe.  I will make this again really soon."
34206,89503,11/22/2004,5,"I am so happy to have this recipe.  We love chicken strips and yet I had never made them.  We always get ""take-out"" chicken stips and they are always deep fried.  These tasted great and were so very easy to prepare and they are NOT FRIED!  Thanks!"
185726,89503,1/10/2005,0,"DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE. I am anxious to try this recipe again but with different cracker crumbs. I used a plain, tasteless, saltless and very heavy type of cracker (that's all I at the time). I also used part bread crumbs.  I added the spices listed but it wasn't enough to add any flavor probably because of the crackers. My guess is if the cracker is good to taste and light enough to crush up with one hand you've got a winner.   "
58407,89503,1/31/2005,5,I really enjoyed these chicken strips! The chili powder gave it a little kick and I loved the garlic taste. I used chicken breast tenderloins and coated with saltine crackers. Thanks for the recipe! Very quick and easy and tasty too.
169969,89503,2/19/2005,5,"I made these in an effort to replace the fried nuggets that a VERY picky three year old begs for on a daily basis. He loved them!!! thank you so much for a heathy alternative to chicken nuggets.
BTW - this recipe is also very kid-kitchen friendly. I put everything in shallow plates and he made the nuggets himself. I was so surprised at how well he breaded them...and he was so proud! Thanks also for the Friday night smile!!! 
Oh, and the adults ate them right up too!!!! Delicious!"
51011,89503,2/20/2005,5,"Wow! These were super easy and good! Perfect for a busy night.  My dh was angry when he realized we were out of what I usually buy, so I whipped these up instead.  Thanks so much for sharing, no changes were necessary!"
81611,89503,3/7/2005,5,"I needed something easy, and these fit the bill. I used 3 chicken breasts. My only complaint is that 2c of breadcrumbs was WAY too much; I might have used 1/2c-3/4c. Next time I   might use the same spices but w/only 1c crumb (I make my own from homemade bread, so I hate to waste). I really liked these dipped in ranch dressing. Mine took 20 min. to cook; I think it all depends on ""how you slice it"". Mine were about 1/4-3/8"" thick. My whole family loved them, and I love that it's healthy and easy. It's a keeper!"
188547,89503,3/7/2005,3,"My family didn't really like these.  We didn't put the chili pepper in, and thought it was a bit bland.  If you have a good dipping sauce, they might be better."
50969,89503,5/21/2005,4,"first i must tell you that these are really good.i needed something for just 2 people and this fit the bill.this recipe could be doubled very well.as for the bread crumbs i didn't use the full 2 cups, i just used 3/4 cup of seasoned and i still added the chili powder.it took just a little longer to bake these,i guess it was the way i cut them.i didn't need dipping sauce i thought they were good on their own. for a different taste you could even change the seasonings.i will make this again thank you."
83961,89503,8/19/2005,5,These were delicious!  I made them with the italian flavored bread crumbs which gave them a great flavor.  They tasted even better when dipped in Audrey's Honey mustard dressing #45529.  
168087,89503,11/12/2005,3,Used crushed cornflakes instead of bread crumbs.  I think i added too much pepper.  but these are simple healthy dish that you can make again and again.  I used HOney mustard dressing #4058 for the dipping 
185105,89503,11/16/2005,5,"These were wonderful!  So easy!  I did add 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs (I used Italian style breadcrumbs -- all I had on hand)...I did cook them for 30 minutes because we like ours ""well-done""...But the kids loved these and so did I!  This is a new keeper on our monthly rotation!  Thank you for this recipe, Amanda Beth!  YUM!  "
37036,89503,1/7/2006,5,"My family really enjoyed this chicken.  I used 1/2 bread crumbs and 1/2 cracker crumbs, and Italian seasoning.  I loved the fact that they aren't fried.  I served this with noodles and corn and it made a really quick and easy week night dinner.  Thanks Amanda Beth for a wonderful recipe!  "
28729,89503,3/31/2006,5,These were very good. I had trouble getting these to brown up but I sprayed them with buttered Pam lightly and left them in 5 extra minute on each side and they got a nice golden color to them. I used chicken tenders so I didn't have to cut up the chicken. The kids said 5 stars all the way-I didn't get to try any cause they beat me too it! Thanks for a very easy kid TNT recipe. Next time I will know to make lots more.   
220403,89503,5/12/2006,5,"Delicious!!  I used leftover crushed croutons and also took your suggestion and replaced the chili powder with Italian seasoning.  My strips were a little thicker, so I baked for 20 minutes.  They were very  tasty & moist inside!  Quick & easy!!  Thanks!! "
308765,89503,8/11/2006,3,"I made these as another reviewer suggested, with only 1 cup of plain breadcrumbs.  I think these would be better with some more seasonings  (mustard? more garlic?) or crackers instead of breadcrumbs, but they were easy to make and good for a weeknight.  I made them with some roasted potato cubes that I nuked ahead of time to match their cooking time to the chicken."
279722,89503,9/2/2006,5,"My little sisters ate ALL of the chicken. It came out very moist and didn't take long to cook. Next time I will bake it a little longer because although the chicken was done, it did not brown enough for me. I would have liked it to turn out darker. But taste is what I am rating and the taste was worthy of five stars!"
186802,89503,1/1/2007,5,"Very, very good! :)  I used cracker crumbs and served with BBQ sauce.  I made these as part of our New Year's Day appetizer menu.  They were really crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Thank you for the great appy recipe!"
36540,89503,1/12/2007,2,"The chicken did stay moist, but I found the flavor to be incredibly bland. I even doubled the spices because the proportions seemed a bit off. If I attempt this dish again, I will try cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs."
326051,89503,1/25/2007,4,"I used Italian breadcrumbs, tripled the seasonings (except the salt, which I left alone), and added a little cayenne pepper.  Very easy and quick.  Next time I think I will try it with panko breadcrumbs."
130816,89503,1/26/2007,2,"This is dish number 5 from the simple chicken recipes that I have tried, but our family found it the least tasty of all. I used breadcrumbs, and I wish I would have used only one cup because the other seasonings were completely lost, and I had a ton of breading left over. If  I try it again, I will use everyone's advice and use cracker crumbs instead."
270123,89503,1/29/2007,4,"I substituted the Italian seasoning for Chili powder, and this came out wonderful!  We'd definitely make it again, except I'd add some parmesan cheese and use chicken tenderloins instead."
173880,89503,2/5/2007,5,"These were great for a quick, light lunch. I used plain breadcrumbs and egg substitute and made nuggets instead. They were so moist! Just be sure to keep the pieces spread out on the baking sheet to ensure an extra crispy outcome."
284812,89503,2/10/2007,2,The seasoning was bland and missing something.
430471,89503,2/26/2007,5,"These were very easy and tasted great. I used a whole 3 lb bag of chicken tenders.  I did half with crushed ritz crackers and chili powder and half with italian breadcrumbs.  I would like to try this recipe with fresh meat and flash freeze for nuggets. Couldn't do that this time, because meat was already frozen."
65720,89503,2/28/2007,5,"These were really good! I scaled down the recipe since there were just two of us, used chicken tenderloins, Penzey's Rocky Mountain Seasoning, and panko crumbs. I lightly sprayed the tops with Pam and baked for 3o minutes.I'm glad I found this tasty, low-fat recipe- thanks for posting it!"
243711,89503,3/5/2007,4,"These were pretty good.  I will make them again, but I'll add more seasonings next time.  They're easy, and I know my grandkids will like them for sure!  I used panko crumbs and they were indeed crispy.  Thanks for posting!"
407812,89503,3/12/2007,5,"I love that these are a healthy alternative! These came out tender and crunchy, I had baked the strips on top of cooking oil sprayed parchment paper and did have to bake it for a bit longer than 10-12 minutes. The seasoning adjustment is very important if you use plain breadcrumbs; since cracker crumbs (the cracker) is usually salted or more flavorful.
I used 1/2 panko and 1/2 wheat cracker crumbs, omitted the chili powder, doubled the garlic powder, added a little more salt, and added some paprika as well.
Next time I will try a little parmesan cheese and maybe even some thyme.  I'll bet this could work for fish strips as well!"
422609,89503,3/30/2007,4,"These were easy and yummy.  Great as a party snack!  Add whatever seasonings you like ... but I really enjoyed the spices suggested in the recipe, just added a bit more than called for 'cause we like things spicey!  Served with three dipping cups: barbecue sauce, ketchup, and ranch dressing."
370447,89503,4/20/2007,5,These were very good!  I served them with buffalo sauce and my 7 year old (she loves hot wings) ate a ton!  Thank you!
440047,89503,5/8/2007,2,"If I make them again, I will use flavored breadcrumbs. Just a little bland for me."
407007,89503,5/10/2007,5,this was GREAT. looked and tasted like restaurant quality. and healthier. ;) thanks for sharing!
508459,89503,6/21/2007,5,"Yummy! Was going to make these for the kids but they sounded so delicious I made them for the whole family.  I lightly toasted the breadcrumbs in the oven first so I had no problems getting a golden finish. Also I had run out of eggs so I first dipped chicken in melted butter before coating. I used garlic powder and italian seasoning.  A big hit with everyone, thanks for a great recipe."
323545,89503,6/26/2007,4,These were good! Although I do think I will try the Italian seasoning and breadcrumbs mentioned below -- that sounds like a delicious combo! All in all we really enjoyed them! I also made homemade honey mustard sauce to dip them in! Thanks for posting!
131021,89503,8/16/2007,4,"I made the italian version and they tasted good. Mine, however, never got brown, but they were good."
526547,89503,9/24/2007,3,These tasted too much like a cracker and too little like breaded strips.  I think that I will keep the recipe and use less cracker and more spice for a 2nd try - since it is VERY ecconomical.
586672,89503,10/11/2007,5,My husband personally prefers the chili rather than the italian seasoning but my kids and I enjoy both.  They do also take a little over 30 minutes to bake but I think its my oven.  Thanks for the dish!
190402,89503,10/12/2007,5,"I have made these several times and they are really good!  I usually use seasoned breadcrumbs and the italian seasoning instead of the chilli powder.  I also have started to use about 1/2 the amount of bread crumbs stated because I always have so much left over.  This is an easy, quick, fool proof meal.  Thank You for sharing :)"
483341,89503,11/6/2007,4,"This recipe was very good. I marinated the chicken strips for 2 hours before coocking with 1/4 cup hot sauce, a dash of ground all spice and cajun seasoning. They came out perfectly done, with optimal crispness and nice color."
586291,89503,11/20/2007,5,These were great!
519010,89503,12/22/2007,5,Mmmm...delicious! So quick and easy and goes great with home-made french fries!
175124,89503,1/30/2008,5,"Great ... I over cooked them just a tad, but only because I wasn't really paying attention to the timing. For the crumbs, I used a combination of wholemeal saltines, Kavli crispbreads, and Weetbix cereal, whizzed in my stickmixer food processor attachment."
454599,89503,3/6/2008,4,"Made this for a group of children, but the adults liked it even more!!  But it's sometimes hard to get kids to realize that the ""homemade"" is better than what comes in a bag or a foil packet!!lol"
815416,89503,4/12/2008,4,"This was a great meal.  I used crushed cheese and garlic croutons, garlic salt and crushed red peppers (pizza topping type). And these turned out great.  Love these things!"
180090,89503,7/5/2008,4,These were very easy to make and had a nice light flavor. I used crushed saltines for the coating. My husband really enjoyed these. Thanks for posting!
573544,89503,7/12/2008,4,"They are very good. I ran out of cracker crumbs, so I ended up with a mixture of crackers, breadcrumbs (plain) and some corn flake crumbs. Husband had them with BBQ sauce, dd opted for ketchup and mustard and I had mine plain. Forgot to rate these the first time and came back to find the recipe...guess what's on the menu for tonight?!?!"
490142,89503,7/15/2008,5,"Chicken fingers without the cost or the guilt?  I'm IN!  These were fabulous!  The only thing I will do differently next time is make half of the breading mixture.  I used 2 normal-sized chicken breasts and ended up throwing a lot of the breading mixture away.  Besides that, this recipe was perfect!  Thanks, Amanda Beth!"
898608,89503,7/21/2008,5,"Oh my god! This was so easy to make and it was so, so, so good! I made both Italian and the one with the chili pepper. Both were good, but I kinda liked the original one with the chili pepper better. This is the first time i bake with finely crushed crackers and it came out very crispy. I'm so glad I found this site. Thanks for the recipe."
593159,89503,8/29/2008,3,"Not too bad.  They were very simple to make and I love that they are a healthy alternative to fried chicken nuggets.  They were a little bland for us, so next time I'll add more seasonings.  Maybe a packet of ranch dip mix"
254128,89503,10/28/2008,5,"So quick, easy, and good. Really like these. Made up a bunch and we'll be taking them in lunches for a while. They freeze great."
1006341,89503,11/1/2008,5,"I also cooked longer (30 mins) and increased the temp to 400. A similar recipe I had said place pats of butter around the chicken before baking. Tastes great and still crispy. Use the buttery crackers for crumbs, add italian seasonings."
357323,89503,1/2/2009,5,These were so good! Much better than the fat-laden store bought kind. I used homemade breadcrumbs and increased the chili powder. I will certainly make these again!
1076165,89503,1/14/2009,3,"I agree with annlouise: 2 cups is way too much bread/cracker crumbs--I used 5 breasts instead of 2 and I still had crumbs left over!  It's also not terribly flavorful.  I'm wondering if it's a typo, and 2 cups should have been 1/2 cup.  I'll try it that way next time, leaving the pepper and chili powder the same.  I also recommend flavored/seasoned breadcrumbs."
1135597,89503,1/19/2009,4,"This was easy, we also added chicken salt and the kids love, easy dinner."
599204,89503,1/25/2009,5,"Thank you for this recipe, it was just what I was looking for. I didn't make it the exact same way, but I did use it for a jumping off point. So, here's what I did: instead of egg I used milk, I used salt, black pepper, and cayenne, and I covered it with foil and baked it for about 30 minutes. The chicken came out moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. Again, thank you for this recipe!"
348437,89503,1/31/2009,5,"The BEST breaded chicken I've ever had! I followed the recipe, using crushed ritz crackers. The flavor was incredible! The chicken was super moist and juicy. On a few of the last ones, I double battered them-- in the egg, then crackers, then repeat! Those were extra good. They came out crisp and delicious. Weren't even soggy on the bottom."
173579,89503,2/18/2009,5,Great recipe.  I used the cracker crumbs. They were so tasty.  Quick and simple to make.  Will make again soon.  Thanks for sharing.
367164,89503,4/19/2009,4,"This is a good healthy alternative to the deep fried strips my kids love.  I cut the chicken breasts into strips, used Italian bread crumbs (only needed 1 cup), and didn't use the chili powder (as recommended).  I cooked the chicken for 10 min on one side and 10 min on the other and used BBQ sauce to dip.  The chicken was moist and the flavor was decent.  It wasn't very crunchy, however.  I would make these again.  Thanks!"
157425,89503,5/7/2009,5,"Very good chicken strips, easy and quick to make. I used a  one pound package of chicken breast tenderloins, breadcrumbs, and garlic pepper salt. One egg didnt seem like enough so I used two and that worked better for me. I used ranch dressing for dipping and DH used barbecue sauce. Nice crunchy coating that stayed on well and the chicken was tender. Served with Maries Recipe #77514 #77514 and whole kernel corn. Will make these again, thank you AmandaBeth for posting! Made and reviewed for the Kid Friendly Recipe Tag Game."
726934,89503,6/19/2009,5,"Easy, quick and very tender and tasty chicken! Changes I made-added Tony Chachere's and onion powder instead of salt, black pepper, and garlic powder (didn't have it). Dipped in ketchup, ranch, and honey mustard. Was best with ketchup and ranch. Would have loved to dip with sweet BBQ sauce too since the chicken has a kick. Thanks!!"
507422,89503,8/12/2009,5,Absolutely wonderful.  All three of my picky eaters cleaned their plates and even asked for seconds.
56547,89503,9/15/2009,5,"great recipe- I did have to use two eggs for the same amount recipe, but came out tasting very good- thank you :)"
1419801,89503,11/13/2009,5,"Wow!  I LOVE chicken strips and never knew how to make them.  These will be a staple in our home!!  I had to alter the recipe a bit though to accomodate what was in my cabinets!  I used 1 cup Italian style breadcrumbs, 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt and 1/8 teaspon black pepper.  Came out amazing!!!!!"
879716,89503,4/1/2010,5,These made for a yummy dinner.  Mine didn't really get crispy but the coating held up well and was full of flavor.  I would defintely use this recipe again.
125388,89503,4/15/2010,5,"These were really good, and so easy to mix up and bake.  I used Ritz crackers for the cracker crumbs.  In my oven, these took about 18 minutes to cook, I turned them after 10 minutes to brown evenly on both sides.  This served 3 of us for dinner."
501778,89503,5/1/2010,4,These were pretty good!
1643815,89503,6/30/2010,5,Amazingly good. I added Montreal Chicken seasoning and it was awesome.
913712,89503,10/17/2010,5,"I made this to have ""something different"" for dinner a few weeks ago. Fiance and I loved it! He ate the leftovers later that night. I did omit the chili powder for Italian seasoning. Thanks for a great recipe!"
1298077,89503,2/2/2011,5,"Love it!  We added a little more garlic because we love garlic and about 3T parmesean cheese.  Excellent, cooked up very nice!  I made ""nuggets"" for DS and I had strips.  Will use again."
407088,89503,2/16/2011,5,"Well, for a family pleasing meal, I simply MUST give this 5 stars.  I word of warning is for others not to count on the time being right on...phew!  My chicken wasn't thick or anything, but still took 35 minutes at 375.  I was amazed!  I cut 3 pieces of chicken (1 1/4 lb) into 3rds, so I have no idea why they took so long!  I mean, I would have thought they were bone-in chicken breasts if I didn't know any better.  Thanks, though, for a wonderful alternative to frying up the little boogers!  :)"
751578,89503,3/13/2011,5,"Delicious! I used Panko bread crumbs & added some seasoning salt & a pinch of sezchuan seasoning. These turned out perfectly crunchy, but as others have mentioned I did have to bake them for about an extra 10 min & cranked my oven up to 400. Yum! A family hit!"
1531743,89503,4/10/2011,5,"We really enjoyed these!  I cut my strips pretty thin, but still had to bake for 15 minutes instead of 10-12.  Made them a bit more healthful by using two egg whites instead of one whole egg.  Also bumped up the spice by combining 1 c. seasoned breadcrumbs, 1/2 c. Panko, 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, 2 tbsp. jambalaya spice, and 1 tsp. cayenne pepper for the breading -- had tons left over, so I would probably only use 1 c. next time.  Thanks for the recipe!"
1837797,89503,4/11/2011,5,Delicious!  Better than any storebought I have ever had.  Crisped up nicely and lots of flavour.
1929073,89503,6/10/2011,5,"Well done. I love the recipe, though there was quite a bit of the breading left over, so I double breaded them to prevent wasting  the ingredients. I used Panko crumbs, and left out the chili powder simply because I didn't have any of it, baked them twice as long, and they were grand. They go lovely with some homemade baked potato wedges and ranch dressing. I'll be sure to pick up some chili powder next time I plan to make these.<br/>Thank you for the recipe, Miss Amanda. <3"
126440,89503,1/20/2012,5,"Great, easy recipe for chicken.  I used Italian panko so left out the chili powder.  Will go with many side dishes."
56986,89503,10/29/2012,4,Very moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Mixed half parmesean cheese wth the bread crumbs. Cooked 10 minutes then flipped them over and cooked another 10 minutes. Also dotted them with butter before baking. Thank you for such a nice recipe. My family and I enjoyed the recipe very much.
2704337,89503,3/12/2013,5,"These were great! We used Panko instead of breadcrumbs, and it was great. We'll make them again for sure."
135566,89503,5/28/2013,3,"I used chicken tenders, which I left whole since they are so small.  Used Ritz crackers and the seasonings as listed.  Baked for 15 minutes and turned the tenders over halfway through so they would brown on both sides.  While the chicken was moist, tender and a pretty golden color, we could not taste any seasoning and found them to be very bland unless dipped into barbecue sauce."
1800127508,89503,10/15/2013,5,"This was amazing i did change a few things though.  i added about a teaspoon of dried parsley, a shake of cayenne pepper, about 1 1/2 tsp seasoning salt,a big shake of garlic powder, some onion powder,and i finally found my pepper grinder i got from the dollar store so i added about a tsp of that all to some crushed crackers. (my first attempt at putting toast in the oven to dry it out some more ended up black.)  i also added a little of all of these except the parsley to a handful of flour.(dip in flour, then egg, then cracker). i used about half a package of crackers, one egg and one chicken breast. it made about 12 pieces.  I ran out of egg for the last 2 pieces so i dipped them in mayonnaise.  They came out with a little more flavor then the others but the breading was loose on them.  I also found this amazing dipping sauce recipe that tasted amazing. My dad loved this and hes the pickiest person i know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heres the link for the dipping sauce. Enjoy :)&lt;br/&gt;http://www.food.com/recipe/zaxbys-chicken-fingers-dipping-sauce-302553"
2000450649,89503,9/3/2015,5,"Just love this recipe. I changed it a bit though. Instead of chicken I used minced meat and instead of breadcrumbs I used pasta. In the end it was a great bowl of spaghetti. 

But seriously: I followed the recipe and it came out perfect. Took a little more than 12 minutes but who cares :)"
738454,89503,12/29/2015,5,"These were great!  I would cut back on the amount of bread crumbs (and therefore the spices, accordingly).  I cut my chicken into 1/2&quot; strips (so there were even more of them), cut the bread crumbs to 1 1/2 cups and there was way too much.  Of course you have to toss it because of the raw egg and raw chicken.  We loved these, though."
265954,89503,1/6/2016,3,"I made these chicken strips twice. The first time, I made as directed (using Italian breadcrumbs instead of crackers) and thought these strips were bland, even when smothered in homemade honey-mustard sauce. The second time I made these, I seasoned the chicken directly with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and oregano, and used Italian breadcrumbs for the coating again. Much better tasting the second time around, but the breadcrumb coating didn&#039;t turn crispy as it should have according to the recipe. My kids liked these chicken strips, though, so I will be making them a third time with crackers instead of breadcrumbs, all of the spices aforementioned, and I&#039;ll add the chili powder for an additional contrasting flavor. Thank you for posting."
2001529850,89503,5/13/2017,0,My daughter in law made this and I'm in love. Never had chicken so moist and crunchy. Can't wait to make them for myself.
2001569857,89503,6/5/2017,0,Sounds delicious. How much Parmesan cheese do you add?
2001596933,89503,6/23/2017,0,Is the time right on this? It doesn't seem long enough.
2001608911,89503,8/6/2017,0,I made these and mine didn't Brown at all. I followed the recipe up until baking them for 15 mins.@375. And then at 425 for 15 mins.more. Still didn't Brown but oh my goodness the flavor was awesome and so moist. We loved them.
2001330613,89503,2/25/2018,4,Next time I’ll add much more spice. Nice fat-free cooking. It’s nice that the breading stays on.
2002050275,89503,3/14/2018,4,I did eggs and breadcrumbs twice and left in for around 15 minutes. It needed more seasoning but other than it was good!
2002266702,89503,9/5/2018,5,I used cornflakes in lieu of crackers and bread crumbs as I didn't have any. I whizzed them up in the food processor nice and fine and did everything else as the recipe stated. It was super quick and very moist and delicious! My 3 year old son ate them up really fast with ketchup and homemade honey mustard sauce. Very good! Will make again. Thank you! :)
5890033,89503,10/26/2018,2,"Sorry, after cooking for 10 minutes the chicken was not cooked. Also, after adding additional seasoning, they were bland."
900305,97478,6/18/2011,4,"DH said one day ""Hon, you gotta find something to do with all this oatmeal we bought at CostCo."" Decided to try this recipe and the whole family loved it, even my picky son who claims he doesn't like tomatoes.<br/>I did double the garlic and add four 4oz chicken breasts to the soup for protein, but besides that I followed the recipe as written."
92641,99711,11/26/2004,5,"I used light cream cheese and am wondering if that's why this mixture never got stiff enough to roll into cookies. I thought I was going to have to throw it out until someone brought in a platter of cut fruit. I mixed some confectionary sugar with the pineapple/cream cheese and served it as a fruit dip instead. I laughed when people started going crazy over this fruit dip! My sister said she can never eat plain fruit again hehe. So while it didn't work as a cookie for me, it definitely wasn't a wash! My guests asked for the dip recipe and want to have it again. Thanks for sharing, I'm hanging on to this one..."
129958,99711,2/12/2006,5,"This is a great little dessert/snack! I used regular cream cheese and crushed pineapple packed in it's own juice.  After mixing the cream cheese and drained pineapple, I decided I did want it a little sweeter, so I added some confectioner's sugar to the mix.  I also added a little bit of coconut to the mixture so you would get coconut through and through. Chilled as directed, then I rolled into balls and pressed the coconut around the balls and chilled. I did find that it was easier to get the ball shape after pressing the coconut into the outside. Just a delicious little bite of something sweet, but not too sweet!  Thanks Amber!"
222055,99711,2/13/2006,4,"I had to make these right away when I saw Bobtails pics. I too after tasting the original mix, had to add confectioners sugar. I added about 1/2 of a cup. Yes, it is easier to flop the mixture in the coconut and then roll into a ball. You only need about 3/4 teaspoon of the mixture to have a nice sized snowball. I also wish they set up better than what they do because they remain somewhat soft. I put mine in the freezer for an hour and they were much better but I am leaving them there and just taking them out as needed so I don't know how they would be after transferring to the fridge. I will definetly be making them for my next wintry get together. Like another reviewer said , before rolling it makes for a great dip. Thank You Amber! "
249422,99711,3/7/2006,5,"These are great little dessert treats.  Great after a big meal.  Very easy to make. I flopped a little of the mixture in the coconut also and it made it much easier to roll into balls. I also added confectioners sugar. Thanks Amber, we really enjoy these, not too sweet, just the way I like a dessert.  Also great to make ahead of time.  Will be making again soon.   "
135377,99711,3/19/2006,4,"Made these for a family party. My 1 year old niece says ""snow balls"" in the funniest way so I had to make these in her honor. I added 1/2 cup sugar and everyone really enjoyed them. Thanks for sharing thos recipe!"
1033798,99711,12/5/2009,5,"Have been making these for quite a while.  Always popular and the one recipe that everyone wants.
To help make the snowballs firmer, drain the pineapple thru a mesh strainer, pressing out as much liquid as possible with the back of a spoon.  Then squeeze the pineapple with your hands to remove any extra liquid.  It helps to solidify the snowballs quite a bit more so they are easier to handle."
601607,99711,5/1/2010,4,"Very nice...I liked how the flavors subtly blended with each other, and not too sweet either..I used the tip of draning the pineapple through mesh strainer and then squeezing by hand...the snowballs turned out quite firm. Thanks for posting!"
2571162,99711,12/18/2012,0,"sounds yummy will taste test on a bunch of teachers. My husband suggested using a clean hanky to strain, which worked well. For aussie cooks the 8oz becomes about 226 gms."
376637,99711,11/10/2013,0,"I love this recipe, It turned out perfect. for Easter I think I will dye the coconut with food color, and add powder sugar to the cream cheese for the kids."
1800357256,99711,12/1/2013,4,"added 1/2 cup confectioners sugar, were loved by everyone"
1800399629,99711,12/3/2013,1,"I followed this recipe and even took out the extra pineapple juice liquid but this treat ended up tasting like cream cheese. I even made the balls smaller to make it edible but this recipe was lacking in sweetness despite the coconut and pineapple. If i ever do make these again, I will add extra pineapple for taste."
2483253,99711,12/17/2013,0,"After the reviews I wanted to try this, but went another direction. After creaming the pineapple and cream cheese, I add 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 2 ounces of orange flavored vodka and put the coconut into the mixture along with one cup of chopped pecans, then proceeded to roll them into extra coconut. Everyone has enjoyed them."
82296,99711,12/22/2013,5,"Thank you!  I was looking for a low sugar dessert to add to Thanksgiving dinner that I could eat.  I used the hints about the squeezing the pineapple, and &quot;flopping&quot; the mixture into the coconut.  Both those made it easier.  I added 1/2 pkg sugar free instant vanilla pudding MIX (no liquid) for extra sweet and flavor, and I love it!  These will be a welcome addition to my desserts!"
1800155683,99711,6/18/2014,4,"Must use regular cream cheese for these. Low-fat or fat-free just doesn&#039;t set up firm. Also, some brands of cream cheese are often not as firm as Philadelphia brand. If you can easily flatten it fresh out of the fridge, it is not firm enough for this recipe. I have similar recipe I love that uses minced maraschino cherries instead of pineapple, and calls for some powdered sugar."
1803127436,99711,9/12/2014,4,"Haven&#039;t tried yet, but I would put these next to my cheese board, I would roll in crushed cheese biscuits such as ritz, I wouldn&#039;t use as a dessert.They sound yummy, thanks fr sharing."
2001504528,99711,11/22/2017,5,"I squeezed the pineapple in a mesh strainer with a spatula then paper towel pressed up against it to absorb most of the remaining juice. Once frozen an hour, they still didn't really form a ball. I threw a spoonful on a pile of coconut then I basically picked up coconut with fingers and covered the top. I was then able to pick them up to form balls. I added about a teaspoon of vanilla to mixture when beating. They are very tasty and will make again but maybe with some crushed nuts added either to batter or as coating to give some texture"
119466,201598,1/10/2007,5,"What a lovely way to perk up a can of peaches! I used raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar (Bragg's) and subbed 1 allspice berry for the pinch of ground. Since the peaches weren't submerged in the liquid, I moved them around frequently while simmering. They ended up subtly spiced and delicious. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Greg!"
1059672,201598,12/5/2008,0,A wonderful recipe.  I prepared it biweekly all summer and am about to make a big batch for Christmas.  I find that I can double the peaches and increase the ther ingredients by 1/2 and get the same fine result.
379453,201598,11/6/2016,5,"Hopefully they will turn out perfect ! So far so good. Will give them a taste check again tomorrow, and am hoping that they will be perfect for Thanksgiving Dinner."
776710,104403,3/31/2008,0,"I never do reviews on recipes normally, but I absolutely HAD to write one for this recipe.  OMG!  I reduced the 1 cup of milk to 1/2 cup and just about fell over in my kitchen when I tasted this.  I couldn't even finish it.... I can't wait to make this again with Dove chocolate and share it with my girlfriends!"
43083,269773,1/25/2008,3,I have never had an egg cream before but I heard that using the syrup in a can (its thicker) was the proper way of making one so that is what I used. This was very similiar to chocolate milk and I couldnt really tell the club soda was there to be honest. I've always wanted to try an Egg Cream though. Thanks for the recipe and I hope you like the pic! Made for Photo Swap!
290107,269773,2/2/2009,5,"This was such a rich, chocolatey egg cream--kind of a chocolate Italian soda. DS just loved it! It was very easy to make. It made a lot of foam, too--which DS loves. I didn't have whole milk, so I used 1% plus a little half & half to ""rich"" it up a little. Thanks so much for posting, Twissis! Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders tag game."
1803545265,355169,12/22/2014,5,My new favorite chocolate chip cookies! So gooey and soft in the middle. Mmmm
452355,497999,11/13/2013,5,"This recipe is easy to make, and it is filling and flavorful.  I thought it had a nice amount of heat (besides the jalape&ntilde;o, I used a blend of Madras curry powder and hotter curry powder).  Ours did take quite a bit longer to thicken to a good consistency than what the recipe specified.  We served with garlic naan from Trader Joe&#039;s.  Thanks!"
1803650388,520769,2/8/2015,5,This chicken was so good and packed with flavor. I will recommend this to everyone!
2000170041,520769,7/11/2015,5,I am anxious to try!
67656,11045,8/28/2009,3,"Was making Recipe #384013 and decided to economize by making my own dressing.  The flavors here are good but the ratio af buttermilk and cottage cheese did not quite work for me.  The consistency was way too thick and kind of gloopy. Doubling the buttermilk helped.  If you are making this, plan to use it rather quickly as the garlic begins to take over and spoil the other flavors after a day or so."
705251,40256,10/7/2009,5,Nice flavors and quite refreshing.  I like how the flavor of the cranberry juice still comes through quite well.  I used a frozen vanilla yogurt in place of the ice cream.  It was not as thick as I thought it would be and is really just a nice beverage. The color was a light beige so I added a few drops of red food color to make it pink.  Made for the Think Pink Event October 2009.
227978,40256,10/8/2009,4,"I thought this was refreshing, but my kids didn't care for it (and the recipe description did suggest this is a good alterntive for the ""wee"" ones).  I guess for kids, it might not be sweet enough for a ""milkshake"" looking beverage.  But I think it would appeal to adults.  Made for the Think Pink tag game October 2009."
407338,40256,10/9/2009,5,"WONDERFUL Flavor!  I put twice as much cranberry juice since I like cranberry flavored items and 1 teaspoon of Splenda.  Very tasty indeed!  Easy preparation.  Prepared as a participant in the The Pink Event October, 2009."
114027,40256,11/1/2009,4,"This was very tasty! I did use vanilla frozen yogurt and light cranberry juice, but I don't think those substitutions made any difference. Next time I'll use a little less juice to make it more like a shake, but this was a really nice drink! Made for Think Pink 09."
560491,40256,10/4/2011,5,Very tasty and not a heavy drink.  DS has been asking for smoothies all the time lately so this was a nice change to the banana smoothie he usually wants.  I did add 1 Tbs Splenda but otherwise made as written.  Made for Think Pink 10/2011.
37636,41641,10/19/2002,5,"What a blast from the past! My mom used to make something similar to this when I was a kid, but it didn't have the green chilies in it. I remember back then, I was craving something spicy, but my mom didn't have red pepper, so I would sprinkle liberal amounts of chili powder all over my serving. Yours was absolutely wonderful! But I have to admit to sneaking a little of the chili powder on it for a taste of the ""old days"", and it tasted great that way too! Thanks Diggy, for your ""Back to the Future"" recipe!"
98001,41641,9/24/2003,4,My husband really enjoyed this dish.  I left out half the green chiles and added more onion and it was great!
22015,41641,8/30/2004,4,This is very good.  A nice comfort food dish and I always have the ingredients on hand.
1523491,96087,1/16/2010,5,Really good and really easy!!
199848,41641,1/30/2006,5,"I'm glad that I found this recipe because I had a busy day so I needed something quick and easy to make.  I used the Kraft shells & cheese mix and I added some chopped green pepper.  Delicious!  It's spicy, but not too much for the kiddos to handle.  Great use of a mac and cheese mix.  Thanx for sharing this recipe, Miss Diggy.  I'll make this again."
288869,41641,2/3/2006,5,This is simple & yummy.  I halved the amount of tomatoes & chilies (personal preference only).
189616,41641,2/28/2006,5,"I added more cheddar and some cheez whiz since we are cheesy people. Child friendly for sure. 
Thanks Miss Diggy!"
50969,41641,5/6/2009,4,"This recipe was made on 5/5/09 for the "" A Taste of Yellow 2009 "" event.While the meat/onion mixture  was browning, some seasoned salt and garlic powder were added.I also added some cayenne pepper for a bit more of a "" kick "" While mixing, I did have to add about 1/3 cup more milk to get it all blended together. And before baking, about another 1/2 cup of cheese was sprinkled over the top. Baked it just a bit longer to get the added cheese a bit crispy. This was very quick and easy recipe that will be made again. Thanks for posting and, "" Keep Smiling :) """
59879,41641,2/21/2012,5,"I thought that this dish sounded easy and super quick to make.  I had all the ingredients on hand but had no idea that I would give it 5 stars!  My family loved it.  My daughter asked me what it was after she had eaten and when I told her how simple this was to make, she couldn't believe how delicious it was either!  This is now added into our menu rotation.  Thanks."
101034,78899,4/16/2004,5,"Delicious and so simple. I did cut the recipe in half, as there's only two of us, but followed your directions exactly as written. The cheese, sour cream and chilies blended so well with the rice, giving it such a great flavor. We really enjoyed this alot. Thanks LorenLou"
238937,139428,9/29/2005,5,"Ive been making this similiar recipe for years, all my college friends loved it, family loves it, and my husband!  I make it light with no sugar fat free pudding, Light or fat free cool whip, and no oil and egg whites in the cake, its fantastic, also experiment with different flavored cakes and puddings!!! "
251705,139428,2/5/2006,5,yum you should try banana cream pudding mix with no choc. chips instead add sliced bananas YUM ;)
54678,180779,8/30/2006,4,I had cut up all the vegies and realized I didn't have the mozz cheese so I had to substitute with ricotta. I also didn't drain the excess liquid which resulted in soupy results. But the kids still loved it and so I will be trying this recipe again with the correct cheese. I also didn't have any italian seasonings so I threw in soome fresh herbs.
336058,202744,3/11/2007,4,"Well, if I can drink it, it's good! Seriously, I'm not a big fan of tea and this combo is very palatable.  It doesn't need sugar bcz of the apple juice.  The cinnamon was a bit strong for me, so I might try cutting the cinnamon apple bags to 2 or 3 and adding a couple of green tea bags next time.  Very easy to make.  Thanks Juenessa!"
340130,202744,7/22/2007,5,"Healthy and refreshing - I love it!
I try to stay away from both sugar and artifical sweeteners. I was out of honey so I tried this. The apple juice is a wonderful natural sweetener. This IS a keeper - thank you."
209747,202744,8/6/2007,5,Nice change from plain old Iced tea! My family does not care for anything other then plain old tea but I LOVe variety! This was nicely flavored and very refreshing! Thanks Juenessa!
169430,202744,8/19/2007,5,A refreshing and delicious tea drink. I made it just by the recipe except in a half amount and I put a cinnamon stick into the pitcher. I made it last night and chilled it overnight. It's highly recommended with a high Yumm factor.
407007,202744,12/22/2008,5,"I love this stuff. I used orange tea bags in lieu of the peach passion kind - still tasted amazing. I also added about a tbsp of honey. :) Again, I love this - I will make it over and over."
59686,202744,9/22/2009,5,"Juenessa, I made this twice, as I wasn't too thrilled with how the tea tasted the first time, as the cinnamon was quite strong, so I made it again, and prefered this tea the 2nd time around. The second time I made this, I used 6 country peach passion tea bags, but only 3 cinnamon apple spice tea bags. The brand of Apple Juice I used in this tea was... Nature's Nectar. Also, when making the tea, I just bring the water to a boil, (but not a rolling boil) then I remove it immediately from the heat; pour it into a glass pitcher, (w/the tea bags) cover the pitcher with plastic wrap, and let the tea set for 1 hour. What a difference in the taste of the tea, after it sets for an hour. Otherwise the tea is a bit weak in flavor if it's just steep for 10 minutes. I'm editing my review, as I just added a packet of Splenda to my glass of tea filled with ice, and I enjoyed the tea even better. Thanks for the recipe Juenessa."
1615854,401824,10/11/2010,5,"I followed Seasoned Cook's tips and this recipe was great.  I made it a day ahead and when I served it, the maple flavour came singing through.  I first steamed the sweet potatoes and the skins slipped off and then added the maple syrup and butter - no thyme though.  I will make this again (and again and again) as it will easily replace a much more complicated, much richer recipe.  thanks."
357358,216108,12/14/2009,4,"Never send a man grocery shopping for a recipe that specifically states ""do not increase amounts of ingredients"". :) DH came home with 3.59 pounds of bottom round roast (which I cubed), a 29 ounce can of diced tomatoes and a 28 ounce can of tomato sauce. I cooked it all for 8 hours in the slow cooker on high because my oven was being used for baking Christmas cookies all day. Although a bit ""tomatoey"" (which was our fault), this was easy and turned out well. I did cut back on the salt, but would leave it out altogether next time and just let each person decide for themselves if they would like to add salt and pepper. If using canned diced tomatoes, I am sure you could use 8 ounces tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. Thanks for sharing!"
421004,295963,7/13/2008,5,"These were wonderful!! Very easy to make and everyone loved them!! I could not find rye cracker's at either of my local grocery stores so I used Town House multi grain crackers which were fine but I can't wait to make again using the rye crackers!! Thank You for a great recipe, I will be making these over & over again for get togethers!!"
768039,295963,6/22/2010,5,"Delicious!
These are very easy to make. I was surprised at how tender and light they are. I followed the  recipe exactly as written, made no substitutions.  Most of these are now stashed in my freezer, it's great having frozen appetizers on hand for impromptu gatherings. The ones we did eat were very tasty with a dijon dip. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!"
1153915,315443,5/4/2010,5,This is a regular in my cookbook.  It's fast & easy for those busy evenings.
494084,315443,5/8/2011,5,"So, I'm giving this 5 stars because it was easy and good...but I am cringing at the same time because it is so unhealthy.  I used brown rice and added some peas to try and make it *a little* better for us!  But, its good...so try it!!  Thanks rusted_essence..."
2788035,315443,4/16/2013,5,"I added some garlic pepper,thyme, salt and parsley to my chicken while it was cooking! Was delicious! Great recipe!"
1802389045,315443,1/21/2014,4,"This is a great baseline to give you a start to your meal. I tweaked it a bit though. Instead of Minute Rice, I used Basmati rice and cooked it in chicken broth, then instead of Cream of Chicken, I used more chicken broth. I added sliced carrots to the skillet along with minced onion, garlic and parsley. Salt and pepper to taste. :) It was very good, but next time I&#039;m going to back off the cheese just a tad. Or maybe add milk."
1207588,315443,2/17/2014,4,"Obviously this isn&#039;t gourmet or the healthiest of foods either, but it is simple. I just made this in my electric skillet and it was awesome only having to dirty one thing. I prefer these skillet type recipes over the ones you bake because they are much more simple. The only thing I changed was that I added garlic and onion powder. I&#039;m sure everyone will season to their own taste. &lt;br/&gt;I will make this again because it was very simple and quick!"
2000972704,315443,4/14/2016,4,"I cooked my chicken with salt and pepper, and shredded it. 
When it was done I added a little parsley, basil and rosemary to the rice and cheese mix.  I made some broccoli in the steamer bags and mixed into my bowl to make it a complete meal in one bowl."
2001536293,315443,5/14/2017,5,"Beautiful and easy. Needed a last minute that was both hearty and didn't take a lot of ingredients. I think this will freeze well, too, which is superb! So glad I happened upon this, and I took the advice of one who added rosemary. I added thyme and rosemary to the soup. Delicious. I cooked regular rice and added 2 cups cooked rice as I don't usually have minute rice on hand. Rice was cooked with a little coriander and I added a can of sliced carrots at the end."
407338,401824,3/5/2010,5,Delicious!  This recipe was so easy and I made it easier by using the microwave.  I put about 1/4 cup water in a covered dish and microwaved 10 minutes on high.  Voila!  I then added the butter and Smucker's maple syrup... sugar-free for me!  A nice vegetable to go along with any meal!  Prepared as a participant in the Cooking Photo Forum's Special Meals Event March 2010.
133174,401824,8/8/2010,0,This is an awesome dish.  I choose to scrub the potatoes and left the peel on.  The recipe was reduced by half and the potatoes were cooked for 30 minutes stirring once or twice.  They were covered with foil allowed to stand for about 15 minutes.  They were perfect served with Low Fat Mini Meatloaves.  Made for the Aussie Swap.
286566,401824,5/28/2012,5,"I scaled this back for 3 serves and we wishing it was more.  For dietary reasons I did use a sugar free maple syrup and it was sweet enough for us (after talks with the DD she loves the real deal but it is oh so sweet and I don't have a sweet tooth so am happy with the no sugar variety).  I sliced my sweet potato and I also sprayed the pan before before layering them in which I think helped with the turning and I did have a couple which were rather well done and I did find them chewy so would recommend not getting too much colour into them but then that could depend on how you cut them (slice or chunks).  Thank you Sonya01, made for Make My Recipe tag game (Aussie/Kiwi forum)."
1941161,415756,6/28/2011,5,These are THE BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever put in my mouth! My 6 year old son and I made them together which only made them better. This is now going to be one of my go to cookie recipes. Thanks so much for sharing!
1802778489,500694,5/28/2014,5,"This is a great salad!  It is really flavorful versatile and packs a healthy dose of protein and fiber.   was very popular at a party.  It packs well for picnics and lunches and stays crisp for 5+ days.  It is great plain but can also be put on a bed of lettuce or in a pita pocket, and is great with added leftover chicken.  It makes a great main dish and a tasty side dish as well.  It is very easy to scale down this recipe.  The servings listed are for main course size- if you are going to be using it as a side you will get a lot more servings."
35526,13142,12/3/2002,5,We had this on our Thanksgiving table.  I used the last of my butternut crop to prepare it.  Was a nice change fromt he regular sweet potatoes.
668309,13142,11/27/2007,5,"This is really good.  Different form what most people will bring, and tasty.  The reheating on medium did not seem to make a difference, just skip that part and add peacans after you finish the low heat part.  I cut the squash the night before.  You'll need a good, sharp knife to cut butternut squash."
130133,13142,1/6/2008,4,"This is different and quite good, although I didn't think it was outstanding.  Still, I will serve this again, if only because it isn't sweet like a good many winter squash recipes.  I put the squash in the microwave for a few minutes to soften it up some.  This makes it easier to peel and cut.  Be sure, if you do this, to make some vent holes in the squash;  otherwise it may explode!  Thanks for sharing."
1114246,13142,2/20/2009,5,"Delicious!  I was looking for something different to do with a butternut squash, AS THE REST OF DINNER WAS COOKING (!) and found this recipe.  My family loved it!  Definitely adding it to our repertoire."
401688,13142,7/16/2009,5,I too was looking for an alternative to baked squash and turning on the oven.  Everyone loved it.  The only change I did was to toast the pecans in a skillet as it is just to hot this summer to think about using the oven.  Loved your recipe!
1114623,13142,5/15/2010,5,It's been quite a while since I made this and I can't believe I didn't rate it right away. This is a great way to prepare butternut squash! Thanks =)
400708,13142,10/27/2010,5,"This was amazing and so easy, the taste was enjoyed by both me and DH.  The only thing I did differantly was to use ready cut squash I found at the store, cut the recipe in half (there's only two of us) and added a small amount of freshly graded nutmeg.  I'll be making this often, what a great way to get some really healthy vegies in the family."
252514,13142,12/2/2012,5,"The toasted pecans were so good with the squash and sweet onions. I ended up adding water to the pan to steam the squash after a bit, as it was taking a long time and I didn't want the onions to burn. I think I'll roast the squash in the oven next time and then combine. Great flavors! Thanks, LikeItLoveIt. [Made for I Recommend]"
162522,104403,4/25/2005,5,Really easy & tastes fantastic!  
155675,104403,6/11/2005,5,Excellent!  This fixed my chocolate craving in a flash!  Thanks
245734,104403,9/24/2005,5,I have made this several times for my girlfriends on movie nights in college! mmmmm
8688,104403,1/14/2006,5,"I made this for my boys while they were home for the Christmas holidays!  We had this at Senedipity in NYC, so I wanted to compare the two.  The one at the restaurant is more chocolaty.  I believe they bump up the chocolate and skimp a little on the ice used in this recipe. However, this recipe is excellent! If you want to make this into the peanut butter version (my fav), just add 3 TBS to the blender ;) Thank so much, Sharlene!"
335520,104403,8/13/2006,4,"I've had the genuine article at Serendipity, and I think they use cream instead of milk. As a result, it's a real gut-buster. This version seems lighter, but has ALL of the flavor. my other half can't wait for me to make them again. Thanks for posting! "
601528,104403,2/17/2008,5,"Based on another review for a similar recipe, I reduced the ice to two cups and increased the hot chocolate mix a lot to 4 tablespoons and didn't bother adding the sugar.  I just think that frozen hot chocolate should have a large portion of hot chocolate in it :)  I thought it was wonderful.  It says that it makes two servings but those must be some huge servings because my son and I had our fill and we have half a bleder full still!"
654485,104403,6/4/2008,5,"this is excellent...have made it several times now... due to lack of ingredients in my pantry and patience,I did substitute 2tsp of unsweetened baking cocoa and 2tsp additional sugar for the hot chocolate powder and used 1/3cup semisweet chocolate chips for the chocolate..instead of melting the choc in a double boiler, I dissolved the cocoa and sugar in the 1/2c milk, added the choc chips and stuck it in the microwave to melt the chocolate then I followed the rest of the recipe as stated.  I love this stuff!"
290107,104403,1/10/2009,4,"My DH and I thought this was so-so, but I made it especially for my DS who loved it--so that is why I'm giving it 4 stars. It was a bit more of a pain than other cold chocolate bevvies I've made him (like chocolate shakes), so I'm not sure if I'll make it again. I cut it down to make one serving, but even so it was enough to fill 2 large milkshake glasses with some left over. So if you want a single serving, probably a 1/2 serving would be enough unless you have really super-huge glasses to serve it in. I used good-quality milk chocolate chips, melted in the microwave instead of in the double boiler since it was such a small amount. I used whole milk and Swiss Miss milk chocolate hot choccy mix. Thanks for posting, Sharlene! Made for Comfort Cafe January 2009."
1024724,104403,7/20/2009,3,"This recipe has a lot of potential...I followed it exactly and it wasn't as chocolatey or rich as Serendipity's version (I don't even have a huge sweet tooth). The amount of chocolate should be increased (maybe even to 6 ounces) and the amount of ice cubes should be waaaay less. I only had a 3 oz chocolate bar and ended up squeezing extra squirts of chocolate syrup into the drink. That said, thank you for the recipe, I'm excited to try it with the tweaks again!"
1076890,104403,7/28/2012,5,"SO delicious and so easy!  I used two bars of Ghirardeli semi-sweet, 1 packet of Nestle hot chocolate mix, unsweetened rice milk, and chocolate whipped cream.  Turned out perfect!  Thank you so much for this recipe!"
199848,107792,10/23/2006,5,"The Dijon mustard adds a nice unique taste to this soup.  I used the fat free sour cream and it tasted like I added regular cream.  Great texture/thickness.  Takes a bit of time to make, but it's worth the time!  Thanx for sharing; I'll make this again."
392230,137915,5/15/2007,4,"Excellent meal!It's so tasty and the convenience and clean-up are great!This comes together pretty quickly, and tastes like you spent a lot longer on it than you actually have to!I will surely be making this again!"
869797,143848,11/8/2008,5,"This cake baked up beautifully!  A nice rise, lovely flavor and so easy to make.  The only thing I deviated was I added clove, allspice and cardamon, and mixed the spices with the sugar before proceeding with the remainder of the recipe.  No icing needed, just used powdered sugar.  This was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Thank you for posting!"
57437,145465,10/4/2007,5,"This produces a wonderfully flavored, tender, fall apart roast. I didn't wrap in foil, though, just put it all in the crock. I also used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. I have been making this for years and we love it! In fact I wanted the leftovers the next day, and unfortunately someone already beat me to them!"
369715,145465,4/16/2010,5,Very good roast. I followed the recipe as written and we all enjoyed this. This is so simple to make yet produces a great tasting roast. Made for Spring PAC 2010.
165074,145465,7/28/2013,5,I was going to post this recipe as it has become my favorite way to prepare beef roast.  I bought the cookbook last year and have given the recipe to all of my friends.  I&#039;ve tried different cream soups and find that my family prefers Golden Mushroom soup better than regular Cream of Mushroom.  The roast is always so tender and the flavor is excellent.  I&#039;m sorry that I didn&#039;t run across this recipe a few years ago.  Now I have it saved in my cookbook and can refer back to it or print it any time.....just in case someone has borrowed my cookbook.  Thank you Amy for posting this wonderful recipe!!!
258285,169900,8/27/2007,4,"We really liked the simple flavor of these.  Only five ingredients and simple to make.  At first the directions were a bit confusing...I had to read it a couple of times.  I think what threw me off was the fact that you made two pans worth.  As there are only two of us, I cut the recipe down and made one pan.  They did brown very nicely, but I had a wee bit of trouble getting the paper off as some of the potatoes were sticking.  Also, it did not stay in a wedge shape at all, so I just spooned it out onto the plates.  I didn't have any fresh thyme, so used fresh sage instead.  (How appropos!) As I said, we really enjoyed the flavor...so much so that we ate the whole panful!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks Sage!"
353579,185006,2/11/2008,5,"Delicious!  I added some herbs and some cheese to the sauce, and used a thickened vegetable stock in place of the condensed soup.  I think this should be a very versatile recipe, lending itself equally well to chicken, beef, or vegetarian versions.  Thanks for sharing your mom's recipe!"
169430,185006,8/24/2008,5,"This is exactly as promised, good ole' comfort food! No elegance and show here but everyone will leave the table happy and full (and there likely won't be any left!). For the biscuit base I used Recipe#211406  and it was ideal here. To trim the fat some I just micro'ed the onion and celery, used skim milk and lower fat soup. If this doesn't make your man happy you might as well give up because nothing will!"
186070,203291,1/5/2007,5,I have hummus with peanut butter many times it is delicious you really can not tell that you have not used tahini.  I think I saw it on FoodTV maybe on Alton Brown's show where he said to sub peanut butter for the tahini.  Peanut butter is cheaper and I always have it on hand not so with tahini.  Thank you for posting this recipe.
382071,203291,1/5/2007,4,This was my first time making hummus with peanut butter instead of tahini. It turned out great! I think I still prefer the other kind but this was nice with celery. The primary taste was the peanut butter...I enjoyed the background tastes of lemon and garlic. It was very easy to make. Thanks for the recipe! Made for Zaar Tag.
194953,203291,2/2/2007,5,I used what I had on hand.  That was red kidney beans & crunchy peanut butter and grated the garlic.  It tasted great. I let it sit in the refrigerator for about an hour before I used it. I could not taste the peanut butter  just the garlic and lemon.  Yummy!
41984,203291,2/6/2007,5,"I have to revise this review because after a day, the peanut butter flavor was a lot less noticable.  I think that the garlic needed time to let it's flavor permeate the mixture.  This was fast and easy to prepare!  I made this using a 15 ounce can of garbanzo beans.  It measured a bit less than 2 cups.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  After mixing, I thought that it was a little too dry so I added another tablespoon of olive oil and about 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice.  Thank you for posting this recipe!"
331589,203291,5/21/2007,4,"my mom maintains the fact that she could taste the peanut butter, but I couldn't, especially after a day.  I included putting the paprika in the food processor to blend it in."
589254,203291,1/8/2008,5,"All the tahini I found tasted like dirt, so my wife and I were happy to hear it was possible to use peanut butter instead.  There is a noticeable peanut butter taste for a few hours but as the hummus settles it goes away.  

While I thought this recipe was both good and simple I still messed around with it.  I took out the olive oil and parsley and added some jalapenos near the end, just to break them up a little.  I also threw in a little bit of yogurt to give it an even creamier texture.

I served the hummus with some greek-style pitas I'd made the night before.  Yum."
716560,203291,1/16/2008,5,"I loved this hummus! It tastes so similar to a hummus at one of my favorite Mediteranean places!  I had always wondered about its ""peanuty"" taste...it was different from other hummus--now after making this I know the trick-pb!"
209603,203291,3/25/2008,4,this was delicious and noone could guess the secret ingredient.. even after i told them they couldnt taste it at all.. i did serve it the day after i made it and i also put some pl yogurt in like another poster suggested to make it smoother.. it has a good hummus texture (i only had crunchy pb but it blended smooth) this is a good base that could be played with for a lot of fun flavors.. but i like the pb instead of the tahini better and its usually on hand more often.  thanks
171790,203291,3/25/2008,5,"What a great, easy way to make hummus. I made it this morning for today's lunches and just finished trying some. I'll never buy hummus again. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
384088,203291,9/30/2008,5,Wow! This was my first time making hummus and I was specifically looking for a recipe that I actually had the ingredients in my kitchen. The only thing I didn't have was fresh parsley and I didn't have quite enough olive oil but this was still fabulous. Because I love spicy food and was craving some heat... I doubled the garlic and added a few jalepenos. It was awesome!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. Being a family on a tight budget this is definately a keeper and is a new favorite! :-)
384041,203291,11/13/2008,5,"This is very similar to my hummus recipe. Sometimes I use peanut butter as a substitute for the more expensive, harder to locate tahini. I prefer tahini hummus, but peanut butter hummus is also delicious and I have friends who prefer the milder, less exotic flavor of the peanut butter version."
606686,203291,6/26/2009,5,"this is very good, very simple.  my only revision is to use a little more lemon juice and olive oil because as written, it's a little dry.  which is great for sandwiches - but we like it creamier for dipping.  =)"
2158491,203291,1/23/2012,0,This is  quick and really delicious!  I also added a little sesame oil (estimate about 1/2 tsp.) which added a bit of traditional tahini flavor; next time I make this I will reduce the salt somewhat.
1802905166,203291,7/8/2014,5,Proportions are just right. This is delicious! My new favorite hummus recipe.
54243,203291,5/1/2015,5,"This recipe is amazing....Love, love, love it!  I did add a tiny bit of water because I found it a little dry and I did add a touch of fresh jalepeno peppers...not much but just a tad.  Wow... absolutely delicious!  Bringing it to a party tomorrow....let&#039;s see what their opinions will be!"
115758,205995,2/24/2007,5,"These kebabs had a lovely delicate Asian flavour....I cooked mine off in the frypan, keeping them warm in the oven whilst I made a stir fry of vegetables and rice. Thanks for sharing...it's a keeper!!"
149363,205995,4/1/2007,5,"Absolutely delicious kebabs, and so very simple to put together. I made it exactly as written directly on the BBQ, and they were finished in about 10 minutes. I'll make this one again, perhaps using more vegetables for the next time. I am envisioning asparagus and mushrooms! Thanks for a delicious meal Chef FloWer!"
481092,205995,1/12/2008,5,"Any recipe worthy of sending my husband outside in January to grill in CT must be quite a draw. Am I glad we tried this one. All of the flavors came through so wonderfully, none overpowering the other. I used red peppers for a more visually appealing meal and for a more subdued taste. Honey and ginger together outstanding. I only had regular soy sauce so this is what we used. Excellent. I will use this marinade for whole chicken breasts too."
374520,205995,1/26/2008,5,This was really tasty.  I was a little concerned about the green onions holding up but they did wonderful.  I let everything marinate for 4 hours and the flavors were amazing.  We served them over Jasmine Rice.  Thank you for posting such a great recipe.
27783,205995,1/27/2008,5,"Really well received by all. An easy,tasty marinade (I let it soak for several hours in the fridge)."
480195,205995,9/25/2008,5,"I marinated the chicken in the refrigerator overnight and then cooked it on the barbeque. It was absolutely wonderful! My entire family loved it. There was supposed to be leftovers for another dish, but it was all eaten up in record time. I will make this often. Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe."
228037,205995,1/10/2009,5,"Great marinade - used Soy Sauce, and followed recipe exactly (less onion & capsicum).  Served with rice.  Everyone liked it..."
756031,205995,8/10/2009,5,"This marinade worked as a lovely main for our Asian dinner.  I used the sake and 2 garlic cloves.  Thank you.  {Made and reviewed for NZ/AUS recipe swap, Aug. 2009}"
984006,205995,4/6/2010,5,"I used dry sherry and soy sauce in this. We didn't have any ginger, so I also skipped that.  I didn't have the green capsicum or onions, but I put the chicken in grill baskets with red, orange and green peppers and a few chopped up onions and grilled them. This meal was FABULOUS!  It's a definite repeat in our house!"
172628,205995,4/18/2010,4,Delicious and quick to come together.  The only change was to slice the chicken into strips and fold onto the skewers yakitori style.  I've found that this consistently gives me chicken that is done but juicy.  Excellent marinade.
400708,221703,1/15/2008,5,"Made this for our Christmas Eve dinner but just now getting around to reviewing it.  I had a problem (my own) with frosting the layers and it came out kind of cock-eyed, and not real pretty (so no picture taken) but OMG was it good.  I almost didn't put it on the table as it looked so funny, but have to say with a buffet full of deserts, this went first and the comments where outstanding.  It really went together easy by following the directions exactly and if I was a better decorater would have been gorgeous.  Loved the bright red color with the cream cheese frosting.  As I get better with my own technique w/frosting it'll be pretty too.  I'll be making this again as LOVED all the positive comments I got on it.  Thanks WildCook for a wonderful recipe."
28744,221703,9/6/2008,5,This cake is fantastic. Hubby took some into work and a friend said that his mom used to make it for him but hasnt had any for years. The coconut and pecans ad a good crunch texture to it
950564,221703,10/7/2010,5,This recipe is one of the moistest cakes I have ever had!  It was delicious!  It disappeared in 2 days from my house and I only had one piece.  I only have 2 9 inch pans but I am going to go find some 8 inch pans so I can make it into 3 layers next time.
1614147,221703,3/19/2011,5,I cut this recipe in half to use in my minature cake pans. The mix is much thicker than other cake mixes but tastes great. Your kiddies will want to lick the batter bowl. I cheated and bought icing instead of make my own. I will definately make this again. Absolutely delicious!
215851,221703,7/12/2011,5,Delicious!  Very easy to make.  Made it for my daughter's 12 birthday at her request.  The frosting is too die for.  My daughter doesn't like coconut and my husband as nut allergies so we left both of those out and it was still delicious.  Can't wait to make it again.
88099,315033,3/31/2012,5,"OMG these are just delicious.  I'm no expert on Spinach Squares, but I can't think of a thing I would change about this recipe, with the exception of using fresh sauted spinach, which I prefer over the frozen.  I was a little worried that the onions, which I used, would not get done but it did and was just great.  I may have used a little bigger baking dish than I should have making only half the recipe, as it was just a little thin, but still just delicious.  Thanks so much for sharing.  I can't wait to try the leftovers in an omelet filling as suggested.  Made for Spring PAC 2012"
131126,315033,4/15/2012,5,"I can see why this recipe is popular at potlucks.  The recipe is cheesy, green goodness on a plate! I used frozen spinach & much appreciated the tip on saving the liquid.  I can hardly wait to try it with rice.  Thank you for sharing the recipe. Discovered during Spring 2012 PAC."
1934966,338819,8/6/2011,5,my whole family loved this recipe.  creamy & yummy!  used up the last of last year's frozen spaghetti squash.
39334,367047,9/28/2009,5,Oh my gosh this is delicious!! But you're right...oh so very rich!! It was a snap to make...I used Cool Whip because I'm lazy...lol! But wow is it ever good! My DH is taking the rest of this to work today and I have a feeling it will be inhaled!! Congrats on winning the Football Pool SB! Made for Football Pool Game - Week 2.
63526,56519,3/26/2003,5,Very good strong garlic flavor!  A great different way to eat artichokes!  Will definitly make again.  Thanks!
63128,56519,5/18/2006,5,This is the way I eat my artichokes except that I cheat with the sauce and just microwave butter and garlic powder. I'll have to try adding some thyme.
273110,56519,4/27/2007,4,Great recipe. We enjoyed the garlic with the artichokes and much prefer this to a ranch dip that we have had before with artichokes. I added lemon zest to the artichokes while they steamed. The garlic lemon butter would be great for basting and dipping grilled seafood. Thanks Kimke!
704950,56519,10/18/2008,5,This cooks the artichoke perfectly!  Nice and soft and ready to eat!  I used dried thyme in my garlic butter.  This is a great appetizer to eat with friends.  I would like to look into different dipping sauces for the artichokes to see how they would taste so will definitely make these again with some extra sauces in addition to the garlic lemon butter!!!  I am thinking balsamic vinegar??? MMMmmm!!!!
900992,80189,2/20/2009,1,This is not good; not good at all. I didn't care for the marinade or the sauce.
231318,83978,2/16/2006,3,Not a whole lot of flavor. I felt it was not worth the amount of effort it took to make
351844,104126,10/30/2006,3,"I thought they were too salty.  Next time, I'll use unsalted butter as well as cutting it down a bit.  Some of the rolled out fingers I dipped in sugar before adding the almond slice and that did help.  They looked great though!
"
37678,107569,1/9/2005,0,Very easy and will make again.I did 1/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup applesauce. I increased baking time to 20 minutes and dropped by TBSP. and they were perfect.  Thank You 
413092,107569,12/22/2006,4,Very popular at work! I used sugar free strawberry banana
231120,107569,6/4/2008,4,"These were so easy and inexpensive to prepare. I used white cake mix as it was what I had on hand, lemon jello and added some ginger and lemon zest to taste. Lovely! Would be great for a tea party."
235199,107569,12/18/2010,4,"What fun!  Made Raspberry and Lime jello cookies and they are so pretty for Christmas.  I pressed some a little with a sugared fork, like a peanut butter cookie and added red hot cinnamon candies to others.  I will make these again and am adding this recipe to my annual Christmas cookie baking spree!!!  Thank you, mandabears, for posting!"
14410,107569,6/7/2013,5,"So easy! I had a French Vanilla cake mix, and raspberry jello. They smelled so good while baking, and were such a pretty pink color."
678548,107569,9/27/2013,5,"Easy and delish!  These really took about 1 minute to mix up and my kids LOVED them!  I did need to add an extra egg--otherwise my mixture was dry/grainy.  But, I gave 5 stars anyway because that may have been a high altitude issue considering I live above 6,000 feet.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
369715,199138,10/5/2007,2,Sorry for the rating but this was just OK for us. I didn't think it had much of a taste. I think a can of milk is too much and it definately needs some seasonings. Made for Fall PAC 2007.
86512,199138,10/6/2007,2,"I am sorry, but this just did not work for me. The soup is too thick for the rice to cook properly. Also, I had to stir it a lot to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan and scorching. You need to either cut down on the amount of soup, or use more water or milk.  Even using less rice might help. Maybe like 1 cup instead of a can full. It comes out very thick. In order for it to be creamy, you need to add milk at the very end, just before serving. Otherwise, the rice absorbs the milk. If I make this again, I will use more water to allow the rice to cook properly. Sorry for the low review, but this recipe needs to be worked on. Made for the PAC Fall 2007 game."
201581,213153,3/12/2007,5,"This is a real treat for diabetics. I used the nonfat sour cream, and green bell pepper (the red were very expensive). I ate it with crackers, and it reminded me of the Garden Vegetable spread I used to buy for holiday parties. I'll be making this often for myself, I enjoyed it so much. Made for Holiday Tag Game. Thanks lazyme!"
599450,356370,4/18/2009,4,"This soup is a meal in itself. Very flavorful. How it made it into 30 Minute Meals is a wonder, though! There's no way to dice pancetta, chop onions, garlic, escarole, grate cheese, etc. in 10 minutes! Prep time is an easy 30 minutes and then it has to cook! This also makes six very hearty servings. At the time I made this there was no instruction on what to do with the remaining clove of finely chopped garlic; I added it to the meatball mixture. Thanks, SarahBelle9475! Made for PAC Spring '09."
16909,4470,8/29/2001,0,"True ""Southern Cornbread Dressing"" has sage added to your taste."
98063,249719,1/17/2008,5,"Great ingredients but I fear the cooking time is way off. If the pine nuts were in the oven for 45 minutes at 425 with the Brussels sprouts, they'd get burnt. I think I halved the cooking time for the sprouts, and I added the pine nuts right at the end, and they were still verging on overdone. (The balsamic vinegar also requires caution, it was getting too done also...) Having said this, the flavours are really nice and I'll make this again, but I'll toast the pine nuts separately and toss them on at the end. Thanks for the recipe.

P.S. Maybe it was my oven, who knows; anyways I didn't like the look of only 3 stars for something so tasty so I changed it (though if your oven is like mine, be careful with the pine nuts...)"
485728,249719,3/3/2008,5,"I never knew Brussels sprouts could be so good.  I too had to reduce the roasting time to about 25 minutes.  I was worried about the pine nuts getting a little bit too cooked if they were in there all that time, so I froze them beforehand.  This made both the Brussels sprouts and the pine nuts come out just perfectly caramelized for my tastes.  Thanks so much for such a delicious recipe!"
37449,249719,4/11/2008,5,"Yum! I cooked at 400*F. for 45 minutes, adding in the pine nuts the last 10 minutes. Thanks! Made for PAC(Pick a Chef)."
294215,249719,7/13/2008,5,"I loved this recipe! so simple and so delicious.  I added the pine nuts in the last ten minutes.  I will make this again! 

ps I love brussels sprouts"
910737,279221,8/3/2008,5,I thought this was pretty good.  The directions for reheating were spot on.  I did go a little shy on the bacon; I had precooked bacon from Schwan's and 1/2 lb just seemed like a little much.  My picky son and his friend also liked it.  Thanks for the recipe!
452940,279221,8/4/2008,5,"Buddha went beans over this dish! I only made 1 pan, but exactly as written. This is a great recipe for home, and for a camping trip, it would be awesome too. Thanks for posting. :)"
978517,279221,11/8/2008,5,This was a really great recipe. Something different with a great taste. Thanks for posting.
1582575,279221,1/23/2012,5,"This was super good, super easy and freezes perfectly!! My whole family loved it! I did make a few changes due to what was in my kitchen...instead of ketsup I used 1/2 cup chili sauce and a 1/2 cup of bbq sauce. I also used campbells bean and bacon soup in place of the baked beans and bacon. I left out the cheese (only bc I forgot). And I also cooked the cornbread seperately and just placed the dish over the corn bread when i served it. Will definitely make again!!"
573325,305469,2/8/2009,5,"What a wonderful breakfast biscuit! So fruity yet not overly sweet! I substituted cinnamon for the ginger but other than that followed the recipe exactly and my biscuits turned out perfectly! Thank you very much for sharing these, Sam #3.
Made for PRMR February 09."
169430,305469,4/10/2009,5,"Simply delicious! . I made a 6 serving amount and used my biscuit cutter and they raised very well. I just loved the sunflower seeds, the crunch is great. My only change was to use a more heart healthy margarine for the butter and I added a rounded Tbsp of Splenda (just for personal taste). A real treat for Easter weekend and lovely with vanilla coffee :D."
993648,331314,10/18/2008,4,"Yummy!  I changed the recipe a little, using a whole wheat pastry flour, margarine instead of shortening, splenda brown sugar and plum vinegar instead of cider vinegar.  But it was very easy to make and delicious.  The dough didn't fluff up as much as I expected which was my only complaint.  I don't like lots of dough though because it overpowers the apples, so it worked out."
130663,332304,11/25/2008,5,This was an excellent tasty pie.Love the idea of one crust.
79636,134621,3/4/2006,3,"It was good, but wasn't our favorite."
285039,356370,4/29/2009,5,"This was a quick and easy soup, that reminds me a bit of Italian Wedding Soup.  I used frozen mini Italian meatballs from the freezer section in the grocery..and made this even simpler!  Very good!"
170628,356370,2/8/2010,5,"This was an absolutely delicious recipe.  Just outstanding.  I will say what I always say with Rachael Ray 30 minute meals....don't expect to get it done in 30 minutes.  Just rolling all those tiny meatballs take 15 minutes!  It is definitely not a long and hard recipe....just not 30 minutes.  Next time I would add an additional can of beans, because we love beans.  I cut the oil to 1 Tbl and it ws plenty.  I also think it serves 8, not 6.  I will make this a lot!  DELICIOUS!"
930552,356370,2/17/2011,5,"Yummy! I used kale instead of escarole. I also used ground chicken instead of meatloaf mix. I should say that my meatballs were hardly mini! Next time I would try to make them smaller, they plumped more than I expected when I cooked them. Maybe the size of a marble would be good. I also used orzo instead of mini penne because that is what I had on hand. This was delicious, and I will definitely make it again!"
28177,357561,9/27/2009,5,"I have to admit, when I told DH we were going to have meatballs for dinner he gave me ""the look"". lol  So, I put it off a few days & tonight was the night.  I caught him sniffing around the kitchen not 10 minutes into starting the cooking & at dinner all he could talk about was how moist the meatballs were & how much he liked the ""non-tomato sauce"" sauce.  DS had the same compliments.  I too really enjoyed the change from canned tomato sauce to fresh whole tomatoes (I used Romas & left the peel on) & the fact that the meatballs were the ""star"" of the show instead of being overpowered by the sauce.  I used the grape jelly because my favorite cocktail meatballs growing up were mom's grape jelly & chili sauce.  I served it over fettucini tonight (only because that's the only part of the meal that my picky toddler was going to eat. ;)) but look forward to trying it again with rice.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Moonchild!  Made & enjoyed for Fall 2009 Pick A Chef.  You've been adopted! :) http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=310505&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0"
400708,357561,10/4/2017,5,"These are so easy and taste great, held together well and the sauce that went with it was just what I was looking for, a little different and fresher tasting than most marinara sauces. I made one small change for convenience in that I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. So good"
1804690,396668,11/19/2011,0,"This was the best ham hock and beans soup I have ever had.  I followed the recipe which I think is perfect., the parsley and parmagan cheese really makes this soup, using the last of my garden tomatoes probably helped too..  I didnt use the olive oil at the end, and I removed the fat layer on top the next day, and it was still real creamy.  I brought the leftovers to work and the soup was a big hit!"
548973,399367,11/16/2009,5,"I love these cookies and have made them since the Food Network first introduced them.  It should be noted that they are not terribly sweet, a more common concept in Central and South America, but the peanut butter and coconut flavors make a lovely tea cookie.  Thanks, Annacia for including this recipe on 'Zaar!"
860079,399367,3/14/2010,5,"These are WONDERFUL cookies. I used toasted pecans instead of peanuts, and with the coconut, makes for a great flavor. I also used almond flour and gluten-free oats (for gluten-free-ness!) and this made for a little more dense cookie, but great nonetheless. A new keeper! Thanks Annacia for posting - this is the perfect cookie for DH as he likes cookies that aren't over sugary. Made for DIABETIC FORUM TAG (FEB), March 2010!"
400708,399699,11/23/2012,5,"Can't believe I'm the first one to rate this great recipe.  It's so easy and soooo good, but then I love King Arthur Flour and their recipes.  I made using the vanilla flavoring and must say - it was not what I was expecting (what thinking more on the lines of the traditional pecan pie w/just added chocolate) but turned out even better and was a hit with our entire Thanksgiving crowd.  Served with recipe#172098 on the side and made for a rich, light, and oh so good Thanksgiving dessert."
865936,425235,5/25/2010,4,"This recipe worked out well, just be aware that it is only as good as your BBQ sauce!  You should also watch how long you cook it, it would depend on the thickness of your chicken breasts.  I had to take mine out a little early since they were a little thin.  Made for ZWT 6."
165933,453696,1/16/2015,0,This was an interesting combination of flavors!  I would suggest decreasing the sauce from 1 1/2T to 1T.  It kind of overwhelmed the sprout flavore which we love.  Thanks
302961,463273,10/16/2011,5,"This is almost like my own recipe for Sloppy Joes.  I really enjoyed eating this and fixing it for myself today.  Don't hesitate to try this recipe, easy and very good.  I will be the first to say it would have been better if I had cole slaw but I didn't so I ate it plain and not on a bun because I do not eat bread.  Thanks for the recipe.  Pac Fall 2011"
2086710,463273,11/30/2011,5,"Made this with no variation. Sloppy Joe's as I remember, flavor, texture all spot on. Do yourself a favor, if love a great sloppy joe. You've found an original!!"
1442816,463273,11/25/2012,5,"Made these tonight exactly as written. They were fantastic. They won the entire family over. Awesome taste. I don't think I have a reason to ever revert back to a can, Thanks so much for sharing Derfette."
24296,3579,11/23/2001,5,VEARY  FAST  &  esay.
37229,3579,5/4/2002,4,"It was very easy and good!
I used canned apple to cut down on prep time."
170853,3579,11/22/2004,5,Soooooo good.  My husband and I wanted a treat but something not too heavy or sweet.  This sure did it.  It was really fast to make and the amount was perfect for 2.  (really for 4 but we had seconds...) I used 4 apples and rounded everything but the flour and butter to the nearest cup. (I used 2 tbsp applesauce to make up for using less butter) I also sprinkled some cinnamon on the apples before spreading on the crumble mixture.  I will make this again and again.  Thank you! (and your mom too!)
182628,3579,3/1/2005,5, This recipe is soooo delicious!! I used apple pie filling instead of apples and it turned out really great. I will make this again and again. Very good with vanilla ice cream.
152393,3579,3/9/2005,5,"I needed a quick, easy dessert that didn't require using eggs (I was out of them).  This fit the bill perfectly.  I followed the directions exactly and it was delicious.  Thanks Marg for another one of your fabulous recipes."
19166,3579,8/17/2006,5,"This is just flat out yummy! Ours took a little longer to bake, but ovens are quirky creatures sometimes, and it still came out perfect.  We topped it with Haagen-Dazs dulce de leche ice cream and had a very hard time not going back for seconds.  "
292789,3579,1/5/2007,4,This was very good!  Was a nice way to use up the apples in the fruit basket a neighbor gifted us with over the holidays.  I added about 1/4 cup very coarsely chopped pecans to the topping and served with a bit of cream drizzled over it.
433613,3579,1/22/2007,5,"This is Super easy, ansd Super delicious.  I used Granny Smith apples, and a sprinkle of salt over them.  The Tartness of the apples worked very well with the sweetness of the topping. (I could eat a bowl of the toping mix without the apples!!!)  Thanks!!"
180237,3579,2/4/2007,5,"As some of the others suggested, I added cinnamon to the apples before the crisp ingredients.  My four year old helped with the recipe. The only negative I have to say is that I did not have ice cream on hand.  I loved this recipe!"
128473,3579,2/22/2007,5,"The apple crisp was delicious.  We really enjoyed this quick and easy to make treat. The apples were perfect they melted into the brown sugar and rolled oat crust, which was rich, soft and crunchy with  excellent textures.  This is serious comfort food, thanks so much for sharing Marg."
445654,3579,3/14/2007,5,"Wonderful tasting apple crisp. I make all kinds of apple crisp and I put 1 cup of blueberries in with the apples.
I will make this recipe again because it's supendously delicious.
Thanks for sharing your recipe Marg Caymon Designs"
453733,3579,3/17/2007,5,Absolutely delicious and easy to make.  I had a recipe when I was ten years old and left it at my mom's house when I got married.  This one beats it hands-down...even my mom thinks so.  Thanks for the comfort food.
263513,3579,6/16/2007,4,Added 2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I cooked it in the microwave (in microwave safe bowl)on high for about 12 minutes. Thank you. This is a very easy and delicious recipe.
401930,3579,8/19/2007,5,"Wow, I posted on here before that this recipe was too sweet. That would because I'm an idiot and put in the wrong amount of sugar. I just tried it again (correctly) and it was great."
480935,3579,8/30/2007,3,"I thought this apple crisp was a little too sweet. I also felt like you could cut the butter by a couple of tablespoons. It was very buttery. It tasted good but not great.  Maybe I used the wrong kind of apple.  I used Fuji--should I have used a different variety??? Also, I would definitely recommend 4 apples. I only used 3 and it needed more."
352814,3579,8/30/2007,5,"Good recipe.  I added a lot of cinnamon--just a personal preference.  I added a couple of shakes to the topping and a couple of shakes to the apples!  I wasn't thinking and used the low fat butter--DON'T!  The lowfat butter is too soft and you don't get those nice crumbles for the topping.  So, I added a lot more flour and some extra oats!  Great recipe, thanks!"
305702,3579,9/3/2007,5,Excellent recipe!
310109,3579,9/22/2007,5,"So yummy. I've made it 3 nights in a row now because it just doesn't last. I did sprinkle some cinnamon on the apples and then drizzled some caramel sauce over them before adding the oatmeal topping. It did take longer to bake......I'd say closer to 45 minutes or so, but the end result was worth the wait."
586973,3579,10/10/2007,5,"Mom's Apple Crisp was a success. However, I did change a couple of things....I substituted apples with pears because that's what I had on hand. I sprinkled the crisp with cinnamon before baking....Let me tell ya, the smell was heavenly! Of course, it's a mortal sin not to serve this al mode so that's just what I did. Thanks Marg, you did Mom proud!"
201584,3579,10/13/2007,5,"This crisp saved the day. Made an apple pie and messed up the top crust. Made this crisp, baked on top and was told, the best pie ever. Go figure. Served with Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream."
156034,3579,10/29/2007,5,"Absolutely delicious Marg.  This was so easy and so quick to make.  I used 4 large apples that Mom brought back from their vacation in Washington.  I didn't peel them, as I like the peel on the apples, and I added a little cinnamon sugar over the apples before topping them with the crumb mixture.
The whole dish was gone in under 30 minutes after it was finished baking.  I almost didn't get pictures!!!"
562671,3579,11/4/2007,5,This has always been a favorite of mine and I was glad to discover it again.  Thank you!!!!!!!
476592,3579,12/30/2007,5,"Thanks!  I am currently living in China and needed a desert to take to a potluck Thanksgiving lunch.  Everyone loved this.  I did add a bit of cinnamon to the apples before putting the oat mixture on top, but left the recipe alone otherwise.  It's very easy to make and tastes fantastic."
467741,3579,4/23/2008,5,Delicious!  Just like mom used to make it.  I had a frozen crust in the freezer I used and it tasted superb with whipped cream.  Mmm!
933008,3579,10/10/2008,5,"Sprinkled some walnuts in with the topping mixture, and this was to die for good!  Sinful is what it is :)  Thanks for sharing!"
639553,3579,10/16/2008,5,Wonderful! The only apple crisp recipe I use since finding this one.  I add a splash of cinnamon to the apples before adding the topping and it adds so much flavor.  You have got to try this!
994377,3579,10/18/2008,5,"I love this and so does everyone i've shared it with. I did add cinnamon to it, but other than that, it is wonderful!"
999447,3579,10/22/2008,5,This recipe is great!  I did tweak it a bit.  Added a bit of cinnamon and chopped walnuts to the crumble.  I decreased the amount of butter/margarine to 1/4 cup.  For our taste that was plenty of fat for the recipe.
117496,3579,11/5/2008,5,"I just made this tonight, it was very simple and very good.
I have my own recipe that i usually make but i didn't have enough apples for that recipe, so i tried this one.We were not disappointed!!
Thank you for sharing."
8688,3579,11/29/2008,5,"This truly is Mom's recipe!  This apple crisp tastes just the way my mom served it to us.  I've been searching for just the right balance of apples to oatmeal combination and Marg's recipe hit is right on the head!  I always serve our apple crisp warm with just a scoop of vanilla ice cream to top.  I will hold on to this recipe and use it often.  Thanks so much, Marg!"
1041450,3579,12/19/2008,5,It was soooo good.  Everybody enjoyed it.
253965,3579,7/11/2009,5,This is amazing! I have gotten so many compliments on this one! Only thing I do different is I add a pinch of cinnamon to the apples. GREAT RECIPE!
1132472,3579,7/26/2009,5,Loved it!  Quick and simple!  I also added a pinch of cinnamon to the apples after reading the other reviews.  Two thumbs up!!!  My husband will finish the entire pan within an hour of removing it from the oven!!!
709541,3579,9/2/2009,5,Quick and easy recipe that even the kids loved!  Served it up with some ice cream on top and it was delicious!
57089,3579,10/10/2009,5,Needed to use up some apples that were getting a little soft.  It turned out great!  Definitely a keeper.  Great autumn dessert!
1136448,3579,10/13/2009,5,This was fantastic and simple.  I did add a about 1 cup of frozen cranberries (thawed) to the apples and baked for an additional 5 minutes.  The tartness of the cranberries cut some of the sweetness from the sugar and apples.
1352827,3579,10/15/2009,5,Super Easy and my hubby and SIL loved it!!! Very Yummy as well. I used Honey Crisp Apples and it was perfect. I love Apple crisp but some recipes don't have enough crisp. This was perfect! Thanks!!!
837368,3579,10/27/2009,5,"I had a bunch of apples that needed used, and am thrilled I came across this recipe.  DELICIOUS! Only thing I changed is I added caramel syrup over the apples before I put on the crisp topping!  Yummy!! Thanks for sharing, Marg!"
509887,3579,1/6/2010,5,"This was delicious! It took just 5 min's to prepare, quick and easy! Wonderful recipe! The only thing I did was add a handful of walnuts to the crust! So good! 5 STARS!"
1454842,3579,3/18/2010,5,"Really tasty even though it was my first time ever trying this.  I read some of the other comments and added a little bit of ginger and nutmeg to the dry ingredients.  I also added finely chopped walnuts and cinnamon to the topping.  I watched youtube videos to get an idea of the methods (how thick it should be, how to spread the top, soaking the apples in cool water and lemon juice before adding them to the pan).  It was great with vanilla ice-cream."
620763,3579,9/16/2011,0,This turned out great. I added some cinnamon to the topping. This is quick and easy to prepare. Love it warm with vanilla ice cream.
177933,3579,10/22/2011,5,"Loved this crisp! We made it into a pie actually by just putting into a ready made pie crust because that's what my husband wanted :) I used six smaller apples and I added the juice of half a lemon, about a tsp of cinnamon and 2-3 Tbl of melted butter to them and it was just wonderful! Thank you very much... I'm tempted to make it again tonight because the five of us all but devoured it!"
462997,3579,11/19/2012,5,"I wanted a good apple crisp recipe that was easy to make, and this one certainly fit the bill. I made this with several granny smith apples I had on hand. I simply loved the sweet crispy top with the tartness of the apples. Very good recipe...thanks for sharing."
1530924,3579,9/22/2013,5,This is unbelievably easy to make and absolutely delicious! My family loved it! We added a bit of cream on top (because we were out of Vanilla ice cream) and it was so amazing! This is my new favorite recipe!
1052873,3579,9/30/2013,5,"The crisp was great - no need to double. I used really tart apples and it could have used some sugar on the apples, too. Made for Cooking Tag Mania 2013."
383346,3579,10/8/2013,5,This is a great apple crisp.  Easy to do and so yummy.  Thanks Marg :)  Made for Cooking tag mania
394077,3579,11/1/2014,5,"Perfection!  I normally don&#039;t like apple crisp because the topping always turns out soggy but this recipe...my goodness, the topping is so good....buttery, crispy, and so easy to put together.  Thank you for this recipe."
65486,3579,11/4/2014,5,We made this for the first time tonight. It was so easy and delicious. I let my 10 year old daughter be in charge of doing everything but slice the apples. Will make this again. Thanks for the great recipe.
1673412,3579,11/11/2014,5,"Just what I was looking for!  My butter was frozen, so I had to melt it and mix/crumble/refrigerate but it still turned out perfect, just like Mom&#039;s :)  Thanks for sharing."
2000650587,3579,11/7/2015,5,This was an easy recipe to follow. I did change it because my husband was recently diagnosed with gluten allergies. I used Bob&#039;s Red Mill 1 to 1 flour and I added a teaspoon of Nektar and cinnamon to the apples. I also used Bob&#039; Red Mill rolled oats gluten-free. The apple crisp turned out great! My husband loved it!
2000633074,3579,11/18/2015,5,easy and delicious!   made it ahead and threw it in while serving dinner so it was hot and ready for dessert!  thanks for sharing.
2000387738,3579,11/21/2016,5,"Needs cinnamon, but it's otherwise perfect!"
2295544,3579,1/12/2018,5,Excellent...Only adjustment I would make next time is to incorporate the &quot;topping&quot; into the apples a bit
1803169145,3579,10/5/2018,3,This is like the one my Mother and Grandmother made but they would of put cinnamon or a blend of apple pie spices. Now you can you can by a an apple spice blend in a jar.Should try it sometime. The best way to eat is warm out of the oven with good vanilla ice cream. yum.
300215,72107,6/22/2008,5,"Thanks for a great no-salt recipe! Also good because my DH has an onion allergy, so I just leave out the onion powder and it's perfect!"
89138,130793,8/30/2005,5,"Awsome!!!  As a point watcher myself, I loved all of these and have passed them along to other W.W.
Thanks :)"
242006,130793,10/15/2005,5,"How wonderfull! Now I can have my cake and eat it too!  I'm not on WW, but I am losing weight, so this is just great!  I used a chocolate cake mix and diet cola.  It turned out great.  What I did was made the cake, let it cool, then I put Sugar Free Fat Free Chocolate pudding on top, then I topped that with Fat Free Cool Whip.  It tastes just like a cake that my monster I mean mother-in-law makes, but mine is actually okay to eat!  LOL.  Thank you so much for the great idea!!!"
43642,130793,2/14/2006,5,"I've been wanting to try this for awhile, and even with the good reviews here and elsewhere, I was still surprised at how good this was.  I used a dark chocolate cake mix with diet cola, and one whole egg.  I have heard that other versions of this cake sometimes have a soft consistency and strange texture, but this one was a perfectly moist, rises high, and tastes exactly like ""normal"" cake.  I think the egg and the fact that you don't use the entire can of soda (some recipes say to put it all in) are what do it.  Thank you so much!"
46660,130793,3/10/2006,5,"Yum!  I made the yellow cake with diet lemon-lime soda.  Don't think it tasted like a twinkie with the cool whip, but it was tasty, and so few points for a piece of cake is a good thing!"
31499,130793,3/27/2006,5,"This was really good. I used a chocolate cake mix, and a can of Diet Caffeine Free Dr. Pepper. I skipped the egg all together, and it turned out fine. I topped with FF coolwhip. Thanks for a great recipe, I plan to make this next time with a yellow box mix and diet lime soda. "
227226,130793,6/20/2006,5,"I went to a Tupperware party and this was the cake that they made in one of the Heat n Serve containers. I didn't know you could make it in the oven too!  I didn't use the egg whites either. Microwave directions are to spray container with non stick spray, mix cake and pour in container. Let it stand for 5 minutes. Put lid on container and microwave for 8 minutes. Allow to sit for 5 minutes and invert onto a serving plate. Great for a hot summer day when you are craving cake! Wish I had found this recipe first though. I wouldn't have bught another piece of Tupperware! Thanks for posting."
336982,130793,8/2/2006,5,I really enjoyed this dessert. I've been dieting and wasn't sure what I could have that was sweet. Great for those lovers of sweets.
250031,130793,8/12/2006,4,I used a chocolate cake and Faygo Red diet soda. I think I'd like to try a different diet soda; this leaves a very distinct aftertaste. Probably a diet Dr. Pepper (like the cherry/vanilla!) would be better. I'll continue to experiment with this one.
182330,130793,8/23/2006,5,"I make this at least weekly with dark choc. cake mix and diet Dr. Pepper! I make 2 point cupcakes instead of the 4 pt cake slices. Lately, I tried adding a ""filling"" to my cupcakes using 1 8 oz ff cream cheese bar, softened, and two egg whites, with 1/3 c. sugar and 1/2 t. vanilla.  Beat all, and spoon into cupcacke tins after you have 1/3 filled with cake batter.  Then, top with more cake batter to get 2/3 full.  Bake as directed.  DEEELISH!"
229052,130793,1/14/2007,4,My son made this yesterday with diet root beer and yellow cake mix. This tasted good and was moist but the cake was flat. He used fat free  butterscotch pudding for icing.
430471,130793,1/29/2007,5,Thank-you for this recipe.  I used yellow mix and fresca.  Then I let it cook and poked it with a fork and poured SF cherry jello over it and made a poke cake. Great. Little one helped to mix the cake and she loved it.
331817,130793,7/16/2007,5,This is so great.  I felt like I was majorly cheating on my diet!!  I used chocolate cake mix and diet cherry coke.  Yummy!!!
394592,130793,7/18/2007,5,"This was really good!!  So versatile!!  I had a chocolate cake mix and an odd diet soda...a caramel cream flavor (???) I am not a soda drinker it was something DH brought into the house - 1 little bottle he picked up because he likes to try new things - whatever, I thought it would work nicely in this recipe and it did.  I cheated a bit by using 1 egg white and 1/4 cup of fabulous fresh chopped cherries.  I was going for that chocolate sundae idea (?!)  It came out moist and fluffy- every bit and bite what a chocolate cake should be.  A great idea and FUN!!  I look forward to playing with other flavor combos!!! - Thanks for this sharing Mariposa13."
29063,130793,10/24/2007,5,Wonderful and I honestly couldn't tell that it was diet. Made with a white cake mix and diet Sprite and I was surprised that there was no lemon-lime taste. I'm planning to make it again as a poke cake for another birthday soon. Thanks!
231612,130793,12/9/2007,5,"Being diet, this recipe really has no right to be as good as it is! I've only tried it once so far as cupcakes, using chocolate cake mix and Vanilla Zero Coke, but I have an orange cake mix just waiting to be used next time. Thanks for the great idea - I now have a great way to get something sweet in the house without finding myself quickly placed in sugar overkill!"
591416,130793,12/31/2007,5,"Wow! I was so unsure about using soda, but trust the reviewers : it's delish and nobody can suspect the secret ingredient. My family ask me to do normal cupcakes, not a low-fat version, but at the last minute, I felt bad using so much oil, so this is the recipe I choose. No one in my family thought it was a low-fat version :p! I used 2 egg whites (but next time I'll use 1 because it was too fluffy), a Duncan Hines Swiss chocolate cake and Zero Coca-Cola. It rised a lot, so fill the muffins tins 1/2 full is enough. Baked it for 18 min approx. Next time I'm going to try making my own cake mix, with some splenda, and see how it goes. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe! Edit: I just made it with a white cake mix and Zero Spritz, there was no lemon-lime after taste :)"
31807,130793,1/1/2008,4,"The soda adds only a subtle flavor to the cake, but it does work well! Nice and moist. I filled each cupcake with sugar-free, fat-free instant pudding through a pastry bag... delicious."
22015,130793,1/20/2008,5,This was terrific.   Great cake texture.   Not overly moist but definitely not dry - just light.   I used the two egg whites and beat them a bit before adding the cake mix.   I also used a chocolate fudge cake mix with chocolate covered cherry Dr Pepper.   I only got a slight after taste from the soda that was barely noticable.   I will definitely make this one again.
39334,130793,1/28/2008,5,"Oh my goodness this is GOOD! We used Diet Dr Pepper and Dark Chocolate Fudge cake mix...it tastes a LOT like the Wacky Cake my mom used to make. Dark and dense and yummy! There is no soda aftertaste whatsoever! I just used Cool Whip Free to top it, and although it was a little dry I think I over baked it a little, so I think that was my fault not the recipe's! Also when I redid the calorie information I came out with a LOT less than Zaar...so that's a huge plus! I will definitely be making this cake again and again...it is a keeper and I can't wait to try other combinations! Thank you so much for posting this yumtastic recipe!"
785868,130793,4/15/2008,5,"Very Very Good.
it was soo moist, i was very supprized. everyone i told about this recipe thought i was crazy.
i used spice cake with a sprite (i didnt have any diet) Yummy!

I also heard that you can replace oil with apple sauce in cakes."
968335,37413,1/23/2012,5,Yum!! I doubled the gravy ingredients to leave plenty for mashed potatoes.
836432,130793,5/28/2008,5,"I was so surprised that this was good! My mom loveddd it. I used a vanilla cake mix with diet orange soda, and topped it with orange cream cheese icing. It looked pretty that way too...i cant wait to try different combinations of soda and cake now =D"
330505,130793,7/17/2008,4,"Based on all the reviews, I was expecting the same tasting cake as a normally made one - that was my error.  It is a good cake for a diet, don't get me wrong - but it was a bit dry and I made sure to check it early so it wouldn't be over baked.  Like I said - it is a good cake, just not quite what I anticipated.  I used devils food cake with Diet Dr. Pepper.  Thanks for posting - now at least I can diet and still have chocolate cake for half the calories as normal!  Made for the I Recommend Tag game."
419636,130793,11/6/2008,5,"Incredible! I never had such a delicious tasting low fat cake! I used a yellow cake mix with a vanilla flavored diet pepsi. I also added in 1/2 tsp of baking powder after reading some of the reviews that their cakes came out flat. But my cake was actually light and fluffy. I also ended up using 1 full egg instead of 1 egg white. Baked for 25 mins. in a glass baking pan. And just like everyone has said, the cake is very crumby (probably b/c there is no real fat for the cake to hold onto). But this cake still came out very moist and is very diet friendly. Next time I'll try making cupcakes."
211044,130793,1/6/2009,5,"I have been making this cake for some time now. The possibilities are abundant. Lastnight I made Strawberry w/ diet cream soda. I always add about 2 T of unsweetened applesauce for a little ""oil"", 1/2 tsp baking powder, and 1 egg white.
A good frosting is 1 tub of ff Cool whip mixed with 1 pack SF FF instant pudding mix of your choice.
This is definately a recipe that you can use you imagination with."
528468,130793,1/17/2009,5,"This is great as a diet cake. If you want something super rich, not your thing. I used Devils food cake and Diet Dr Pepper. I did use 2 egg whites and beat them really well. My cake turned out moist and fluffy. I also added left over pineapple chunks and sprinkled powdered sugar on top when it was done."
457907,130793,1/21/2009,5,"So good!  I used 2 T. natural applesauce, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 egg white per suggestions.  I made a chocolate cake w/diet dr. pepper.  I love the flavor and the texture.  Then I made cheesecake pudding w/1 c. of skim milk and folded in a container of sugar-free ff cool whip to use as frosting.  Awesome!"
844554,130793,2/9/2009,5,This was so good as a diet cake. It stayed very moist. I used 1 egg white and no frosting. Going into the keeper file. Thanks.
672734,130793,9/22/2009,1,Made this today. The soda left a weird after taste. I'm glad it baked up though. It took longer than usual. I added two egg whites. The result was super crumbly and not very good.
717105,130793,10/8/2009,0,"2 egg whites is a great edition to stabilize the cake 
I feel it would fall apart even more easily without them./ 
I tried zero coke with chocolate and the taste was great"
242856,130793,3/19/2010,5,"Wow! This was better than I imagined.  I used 1 egg white, devil's food cake mix and Diet Cherry Dr. Pepper.  I made 24 cupcakes and was very careful not to over bake them.  I had two different types of pans and one only took 16 minutes til done.  I had some frosting mix which I melted in the microwave for a few seconds and used it as a glaze.  It only took about 1/4 cup and I figured it added about 10 calories,  1.8 carbs and .4 grams of fat to each one.  These turned out moist, tender and delicious with a very slight hint of cherry flavor.   I didn't miss the added fat from the eggs and oil one bit.  Thanks for the great recipe."
1601544,130793,4/21/2010,5,"Just started WW and I am a cupcake lover, so this recipe was perfect.  I used Diet Sunkist and a white cake mix.  I whisked 3TB egg whites first and added 1 TB unsweetened applesauce and then the cake mix and pop.  Made sure to mix it well.  Came out moist as can be and rose just fine.  Made 24 cupcakes and we have been adding some fat free Reddi-Whip on top as we eat them."
831774,130793,5/8/2010,0,"Really good, added one egg white and they came out very light and stayed together well. Devils Chocolate Cake and Coke Zero yummm... kinda undid the low calorie part when i added chocolate icing  and kit kat pieces to some and toblerone pieces to others =P soooo goood !"
368897,130793,7/11/2010,5,"How ridiculously easy is this?? I don't do WW, but I eat very healthy and always alter my recipes to be lower in calories in fat.  I never would have imagined you could add diet soda to cake mix and come up with something so yummy!  I used devil's food and diet Dr. Pepper.  It came out awesome! I did add the egg whites, I think the texture would be off without them.  I topped this with fat free whipped cream, a sprinkling of mini chocolate chips, and a few maraschino cherries and I was in heaven :-)  This is the perfect low cal dessert, because you think you're eating something sinful! I can't wait to try other combinations, thanks!!! :-)"
589801,130793,9/5/2010,5,"Loved it!  Nice and moist.  I did use egg white as suggested.  My combo was strawberry cake with Sprite Zero.  Then topped with FF Cool Whip and sprinkled with chopped chocolate chips.  Way better than any store bought cake, so this will be made many times, whether I'm dieting or not!"
771965,130793,10/21/2010,5,Super easy and great flavor.Didn't know cooking lowfat could be this easy and this tasty.I used two egg whites and diet coke.The cake came out pretty moist and well put together.
459788,130793,2/20/2011,0,"Ok, I made this cake and added 6 TB of egg  beaters which is equivalent to 2 eggs. I also added about 10oz of diet soda. I love the flavor but it was crumbly. I didn't use a mixer to combine. I just used a wooden spoon to stir until completely mixesd.  Any suggestions as to why it wasn't firm. I will definitely make it again but would like to improve on the firmness. Made it in 13 x 9 brownie pan and sectioned off into 30 servings, topped each serving with 2 TB of thawed raspberries and 2 TB of lite cool whip. It was yummy."
322258,128587,6/1/2006,5,I made this Memorial Day and my DH fell in love with me all over again. The buttermilk in the crust mixture really brings out the taste. I will be cooking this again.
1953357,130793,7/10/2011,0,"Just made the yellow cake(sugar free by Pillsbury) with Diet 7-UP.  Very good.  I did add 2 egg whites.  Baked it according to box directions.  Turned out wonderful.  My husband couldn't even tell it was ""diet"". Topped with light cool whip."
402252,130793,7/24/2011,5,"I made a vanilla cake mix (no eggs) with Dr. Pepper (none of the diet crap for me!). I put it in the MICROWAVE for 9 minutes, turned out moist & delicious!"
1669919,130793,10/16/2011,4,"For only using 1 egg, 11 oz of diet cherry 7up and 1/2 tsp of baking soda plus yellow cake mix-  this cake was extremely tasty AND moist, but you have to be very delicate when handling it as it can fall apart on you quite easily, since it is just barely being held together... I sprayed original pam on 2 9"" round nonstick cake pans-baked at 325 degrees for 35 minutes and they came out perfectly done...Had a little bit of trouble taking them out of the pan once they cooled for over 15 minutes, but with extra care and handling got them to come out well... This cake had a subtle,pleasant flavor due to the diet cherry 7 up - we really enjoyed it!  I would definitely make this cake again and recommend you do too!"
2295614,130793,6/15/2012,0,"We added 3 egg whites and coke zero and it turned out great...only problem, I want more than one piece :). Very good.  I have made it without the egg whites but it was flat like a brownie...so tried this...much better."
198154,130793,4/27/2013,5,"I made this with Devil&#039;s Food cake mix and Diet Pepsi.  I poked holes in the cake when it came out of the oven. I had a little bit of sugar free caramel sauce and half a can of fat free sweetened condensed milk. I mixed them together and poured it over the top of the warm cake. When cooled, I top it off with fat free cool whip!"
140132,130793,4/26/2014,5,"Oh my goodness, it doesn&#039;t get any easier then this.  I made this for dessert and my family loved it.  I used cherry chip cake / diet cream soda.  Wow, was it yummy.  Thank you for sharing with us, we can&#039;t wait to try other combos."
482242,138359,6/29/2007,5,"I have not made this myself, but gave the recipe to a friend. she said this is so good she could eat it 5 days a week. she did not use the brandy, as she did not have any, and served with linguini and a salad
she said when she makes again she will definetly use the brandy, as she thinks it will be awesome with it.
she said the flavors were perfect, and she would not change a thing.
I think I will be trying this recipe myself soon. thanks"
366048,138359,6/17/2008,5,A sinfully delicious meal! Served with warm crusty bread & garlic butter. Normally our pasta would have some form of meat or poultry in it but we did not miss it at all. I believe the brandy is a must. It adds a depth of flavour which turns a good pasta dish into a great one!!! Thanks for posting.
1184772,138359,5/8/2009,5,So very good! I used campanelli instead of bowties and the little shells held the sauce very well. I will definately make this again!
316809,138359,11/6/2012,5,"I made this for PAC 2012. Well, this was sinfully delicious and so elegant! I served it alongside chicken and greens and it was a really tasty meal. Thanks for posting a great recipe!"
138047,138359,4/1/2016,5,"This is a fantastic recipe! I made a couple of alterations to suit our palates and I think they worked amazingly well. I added finely sliced spring onions with the garlic and instead of brandy, I used a dry sherry. Finally, when the sauce was added to the pasta, I stirred in a small bag of baby spinach and allowed it to wilt and then sprinkled in some chilli flakes. Delicious, and definitely a recipe that will be made again! Thanks for sharing."
2001844025,138359,12/7/2017,1,"Very disappointed in this recipe based on all the 5-star reviews. Used it for an event and also got feedback from a chef friend. Considering the ingredients, it was flavorless. Made first batch exactly as stated and when that failed, made another with the addition of butter and grated parmesan at the end. Slightly better but still quite flavorless."
58439,194665,11/11/2006,4,"ABSOLUTELY so easy to do!
Deliscious, GREAT for entertaining too!
DEFINATELY a keeper when don't want to fuss, TRUE!
Thank you for recipe from me to you!"
382071,198817,12/2/2007,4,This was a VERY TASTY eggplant dish! I think it would be great over lettuce or with fish. Freddy Cat says hi!
2000927001,217972,3/19/2016,0,I used to work at the lunch counter and this isn&#039;t even close to the recipe we used. :-(
2001921801,217972,1/9/2018,0,I was just telling my hubby that I had the best sloppy Joes as a kid and wish I could just taste that again! Love going there.
369715,62865,11/8/2012,1,Sorry but we did not like these. It tasted like pork chops with ketchup.I even cut back on the ketchup and only used about 3/4 cup.  I ended up washing the chops off and adding some bbq sauce to them so my family woud eat them.
394005,124661,12/16/2006,5,"these were really great. i left out the cloves [because i can't stand them], replaced the butter with trans-fat free margarine and apple sauce, and used egg replacer, so they're pretty adaptable to stuff like that"
1086570,124661,4/24/2011,5,Very easy recipe. It was vey moist and dense. My grandkids loved it. There was not a strong ginger taste but my Watkins ginger was old.Will do this again soon. Thanks fo posting
583349,316377,7/31/2010,4,"I had a ton of sauce leftover from making Recipe #240822 and was looking for creative ways to use it.  I loved the idea of enchiladas, especially with shrimp, since the majority of mole recipes use chicken.  You are right that this is a gorgeous meal!  While the idea and presentation is definitely 5-star, I felt that the ingredient amounts were quite a bit off.  I don't have a grill, so I did these in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes instead, which worked great.  I used 1 cup of mole instead of 1/4 cup and that was the perfect amount of sauce for us. Also, there was not nearly enough filling for 6 large tortillas, we ended up adding a can of black beans to increase the volume.  I would double the amount of shrimp next time in addition to using the black beans.  Because the grilling directions are superfluous in this recipe if you are using the oven and I made so many changes to the ingredients, I have also posted a version of this for the oven.  Thanks Humble Bee for a unique recipe that we will enjoy again!  Made for Bargain Basement tag."
455655,401235,2/13/2010,5,we just loved this cookie this is the second time in a week I am baking them
1551135,401235,2/13/2010,5,This is the best cookie I have ever made.  In the past 1 1/2 months I have made 5 batches and cann't keep my cookie jar full.
12962790,446770,4/28/2014,5,"Made this recipe exactly as written and was very very pleased with how great it turned out.  Next time, however, I will change the evaporated milk to the fat free version and find other ways to cut corners to make it more diet friendly."
39733,29242,9/23/2002,5,This was so yummy Inez. The coating made the pork chops nice and spicy. The sauce had a great sweet-sour taste. This was very easy to make. Made my weeknight cooking a breeze. My family and I liked it very much. Thanks ;)
13483,29242,4/14/2003,5,You are right. . . the sauce is good.  A nice easy dish to do for a small dinner party.  Thanks again Inez.
64682,29242,7/17/2003,5,"Very tasty pork chops.  I had to cut down on the ground mustard because I only had a bit left in the jar, and I was out of seasoning salt.  The chops were nice and tender, and I will definitely try this again when I have all the ingredients."
101180,29242,4/5/2004,5,Excellent!  I make it with boneless pork sirloin chops.  The sauce is delicious.
47510,29242,3/20/2005,5,Very yummy chops MizzNezz!  I made the recipe exactly as written and couldn't have been simpler to prepare.  We also loved the sauce.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
202655,29242,6/24/2005,5,This was just delicious! The chops were incredibly tender and the sauce was so good. I really enjoyed this recipe and will make often! Thanks!
30893,29242,10/12/2005,5,"MizzNezz, these were awesome.  Made as directed except used some homemade hot pepper jelly instead of the marmalade.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for posting this."
207176,29242,11/29/2005,5,Loved these but I would season the chops with salt and garlic powder next time.  I added some salt and had it with tiny pasta so I could eat it smoothered in the sauce!  Thanks MizzNezz!
168753,29242,12/26/2005,0,"This was very easy to prepare, but it wasn't that great. I guess with everyone giving it 5 stars I was expecting something spectacular. It was just average for my husband and I. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
102937,51750,4/16/2004,5,"I discovered Lavash recently and now I wrap everything in it!  I made this recipe as part of a buffet luncheon for 12 women and they all loved it!  Of course, no one knew what lavash was.  I had to get mine from a farmer's market 30 miles away from home!  I always pick up several packs and freeze them.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
815984,51750,6/7/2008,5,"Yummy!
I made a variation on these (based on what was in the cupboard!)
I omitted the onion and capers and used multigrain bread.  I combined horseradish sauce with the cream cheese and it was delicious. Thanks for the inspiration!"
47559,55144,4/22/2006,5,"I made this yummy cheesecake for an Easter dessert this year.  You are right, it is very rich, heavy, and cream cheesy, but had a wonderfully delicious flavor.  I chopped the pecans very small so they were distributed very well throughout each bite.
I did have a problem with it developing a big crack, but that was probably something I did wrong, because I don't have much experience baking cheesecakes.  Thanks for posting this, Luby.  We enjoyed it very much, and my co-workers enjoyed the leftovers."
59473,62865,6/20/2003,4,What a great easy way to make pork chops. I never would have thought the combination of mushroom soup and ketchup would taste like barbecue sauce. Thanks
302094,62865,2/16/2008,4,I made this tonight because it was so easy. This was so tasty! I served this over egg noodles. Everyone loved it. Thanks for such an easy no fuss dinner!
536936,62865,11/23/2008,5,WOW!!!! I was shocked and amazed at hoe well all theese ingredients blended together it sounded nasty at 1st but i tried it and was completly amazed and if you like this recipe also try her recipe for Amish baked chicken !!! thanks again tina for another great recipe !!!!
1102578,62865,3/2/2012,4,Very easy recipe!  Made the recipe as written.  I thought the sauce was a tad sweet.  Might be because I used store brand soup and ketchup?  I will try this recipe again with name brand ingredients.  Thanks!
171790,480021,8/16/2013,5,Delicious. These pancakes are very good with a dipping sauce. I rolled them up to make them easier to dip. Made for ZWT9 Soup A Stars.
168423,128587,7/6/2006,5,Made this last night using a store bought Rotissorie chicken and canned broth. Simple and tastey! This would make a great meal for a sick friend or a someone with a new baby (like myself!). Not spicey yet very tastey and filling. Reminds me of chicken and dumplings.
573544,128587,10/21/2008,4,"I can't believe more people haven't tried this! It's our first cold snap in Colorado - this hit the spot! I loved the tangy-ness of the buttermilk. I made the self-rising flour by using a substitution recipe on here. Used 2 8x8 pans (small family) and baked both; one will go in the freezer. Will make again and again! UPDATED: Had the frozen pan last night. Heated it up in a 350 oven for about 45 minutes (straight from freezer.) Not as creamy as the first time, but still DELISH. Going to recommend this to the OAMC board."
173860,161160,3/29/2006,5,"Thank you so much for posting this recipe! Tried it tonight for dinner and it was delicious.. I did add some sweet red pepper along with the green and it was great! Even tasted better than some ""real"" crab cakes I've had..Thanks again for sharing, will be making this again for sure :)"
196481,161160,4/10/2006,5,These were wonderful. Made them for my meat and potato husband and he loved them. Any thing that makes him smile is got to be good.
125458,161160,3/29/2007,0,"Not sure how to rate this, since given the other two reviews I think I must have done something wrong with this. The cakes were way to potato-y and we couldn't really taste the fake crab in it. Next time I think I will change the 1:1 ratio of the crabmeat and potato. The only change I made was to use red peppers, but I can't see that having changed the outcome too much."
1202811,161160,4/20/2014,4,"I didn&#039;t have any jalapeno peppers so to give them a little kick I added some red pepper flakes. That did the trick. I made them without green peppers, too, and added a little extra garlic.. They&#039;re quite tasty. Thanks."
327600,182259,1/12/2007,4,"Well, this was just the ticket for using up a slice of leftover ham and a bag of frozen veggies.  I think next time I will use a cup or two of chicken stock, rather than just a Tbsp of bouillon powder because this soup was almost more stew than soup.  Delicious nonetheless!"
445602,182259,11/6/2007,5,This turned out absolutely delicious.  Best soup I ever made. Thank you so much
386585,182259,1/18/2012,4,"This makes quite a hearty, thick soup that I ended up thinning out a teeny bit with a tad more broth.  I used the chicken base.  It is also very rich (lots of butter and milk).  I used salt and white pepper to season.  A really nice cream soup.  Thanks for sharing."
601528,227650,4/9/2008,4,A really good recipe!  I made this in my slow cooker so it would be ready when I got home and then I made your enchiladas fantastico for dinner.  The meat was so juicy and fall-off-the bone delicious.
252182,319319,8/13/2008,0,"Haven't tried this recipe yet, but it looks and sounds delicious, but...the chef did not tell me at what temperature the chicken must be cooked at for the first 45 minutes..."
242729,359142,4/2/2009,4,"Simple, classic, easy and wholesome! I have my own method for this, as most of us do, but I was pleased to try Nif's egg in a cup - and with such a lovely story attached to the recipe too! My egg yolks were a LITTLE too hard to dip my toasted bread into them, but NEVER mind, this still tasted great and made for a nostalgic breakfast for me! Made for Holiday Tag and VERY much enjoyed thanks Nif! :-)"
222478,359142,5/13/2009,5,You can't beat a few soft boiled eggs with soldiers! Rather than put the pepper on the eggs I often like to put the pepper on the bread before slicing.
437991,359142,5/17/2009,5,"This is how my mother an me made it! I also remember having this for a light dinner...I love the sloggieness of the bread and i also enjoy this with not toasted french rolls (tear out the white part and leave the crust for your mother)
Made for ZWT5"
510313,359142,8/20/2009,5,"Made & reviewed for Ramadan Tag 2009 in the NA*ME forum. This is such a great dish, my family has been enjoying it for decades! DS has an egg allergy (poor thing) so we don't get to eat this too often which is awkward as my 2 year old DD goes beserk for it & has her own 'egg cup plate' & matching 'spork' to eat with. Delicious and healthy way to enjoy eggs."
37449,359142,10/23/2009,5,Delish! One tip: use room temperature eggs so they will be less likely to crack. Thanks for a lovely breakfast! :) Made for the Gimme 5 game.
280271,359142,11/14/2009,5,"I don't care for soft boiled eggs but DH loves them. He really enjoyed the whimsical sliced toast although he did tell me he's not a dipper...he just likes to spoon his eggs and bite his toast. Oh well, he loved his breakfast. Thanks for posting an unusual way of serving him his breakfast. :)"
286566,359142,1/19/2010,5,"Follow the recipe to the T and you will have perfectly cooked soft boiled eggs.  I made up for 3 eggs for 2 of us, removed DM's to make her toast etc while I left mine in the hot water, the DM's was perfect but in just that couple of minutes mine had firmed up (would do this way in future when I want just boiled firm yolk eggs for egg salad though) - so in future all eggs come out of the pot.  Thank you Nif, made for ZAAR Stars."
144373,359142,6/19/2010,5,This brought back childhood memories for my hubsand eating these eggs and remembering how much he enjoyed them as a child.  This was the 1st time I have made these eggs for my hubsand. Will be making them again.  Thank You. Made for ZWT6 the No-Nonsense Nibblers.
678366,359142,6/20/2010,5,DD could eat soft boiled eggs every day! Made them for breakfast for ZWT6
107135,359142,6/20/2010,5,ok this brought forth good memories   easy and tastes good zaar 6 tour
201581,359142,6/20/2010,5,"if you grew up with your mom making these eggs for you, they continue to be comfort food when you grow up (even into your 60's LOL). This is an easy breakfast and needs to be enjoyed often! Thanks for posting Nif! Made for Zwizzle Chicks for ZWT6."
37636,359142,2/11/2013,5,"Great recipe- soft boiled without being overcooked. I used an egg topper tool on mine which scores the egg so the top can be cut off without cracking into jagged edges, but you can use the tip of a sharp paring knife to do this as well- just kind of scratch a ring around the egg. Takes the headache out of cutting the top off. Thanks for sharing-"
2001658400,359142,5/10/2018,5,"Done, and enjoyed a lot. Had 2 eggs, one of them broke."
546010,386929,2/17/2010,5,"YUM! What a delightful layering of flavors. The sweet peaches really work well with the spicy red pepper flakes and onions. I used  chicken stock with my basmati rice. I did not adorn the rice with the extras. I  didn't have cilantro and it was still fabulous! Next time I  will make sure I top with cilantro for that added dimension of flavor. Oh, I also used orange marmalade cux I didn't have peach preserves. The chicken breasts were very meaty, so once browned (looked beautiful too),  I covered with foil and threw them in the oven to finish them off for an additional 15 mins / 165Â° internal temp. Thanks a bunch Sarasota for this tasty dinner entree. It's a keeper!"
178427,458318,3/28/2012,4,The sauce is excellent! I used 1 teaspoon of salt in the patty mix and omitted the msg as I don't use it. I did the rest of the recipe as written and used a griddle. The finished product is a lot like McDonald's. This is a lot of work and takes a lot of time so I doubt if I'll be making them again. Thanks for sharing. Made for Spring Pac 2012.
2084981,458318,4/30/2012,5,I made these for my husband and he raved about them. They will definitely make an appearance again.
1802990410,458318,8/3/2014,4,"It&#039;s a useful patty recipe, but it uses a ton of salt, so much so that I couldn&#039;t even get through the burger. I would recommend reducing it down to 1 tablespoon at the very least, if not more. I also did not use msg, and the flavor profile was fine but for the salt amount."
2001982541,458318,2/9/2018,1,"4 TABLESPOONS of salt, and 2 TABLESPOONS msg, in a pound of mince? No way, dude. You've effwhoozled your amounts."
1269180,463255,2/20/2012,5,"After all that I forgot the lettuce leaves! So ours just ended up being served over rice, and as my husband doesn't like green beans I put snow peas, bok choy and red capsicum in with it instead. But it was delicious, perfect blend of sweet with subtle sourness and not sticky. Our 10-month-old liked it too!"
128473,480021,6/4/2012,5,"Wow, kate, this was an incredible pancake.  Thin and oh so flavorful.  I rolled it like an omelet and garnished it with green onion and coarse sea salt.  Can you say, yummy.  It was really terrific.  I made a third of the recipe and got two big beautiful pancakes.  Thank you for sharing this treat, that I will be making again and again.  Made for my 3 Chefs - 2012."
133174,480021,9/14/2013,5,These were mixed in the Vita-Mix as I would mix crepe batter.  I made half a recipe and made these using a 7-inch skillet.  I&#039;m not sure how much batter was used per pancake but I got 8 nice pancakes.  These were served as an accompaniment to Recipe #504556.  These will make a wonderful gluten free option for Mu Shu Pork or Chicken. Made for Aussie Swap.
26278,60803,9/16/2003,4,Peanut butter!!! It worked very well in this recipe. Changed this just a bit. I used regular sugar w/ a tsp of brown sugar included in the 3/4 cup. It worked fine.  Thanks for posting!! 
266689,60803,11/23/2005,0,"check your labels, a vegan friend who used to be my neighbor (and so shared a lot of meals with my family) told me that butter-flavored shortening is NOT vegan!"
137428,60803,11/28/2006,2,"Perhaps I didn't understand, but the ingredients listed 3/4 cup sugar twice and the directions only called for a total of 3/4 cup. I went with the directions rather than the recipe list, and the crisp wasn't sweet enough for my family's taste. Maybe Muffin Goddess uses a sweeter variety of apples than those I had on hand."
113767,82126,3/22/2004,5,"This recipe earned a 5 star review for the single fact that it makes a loaf of bread that's the perfect texture for big croutons.  That aside, it makes a very tasty loaf of bread.  I thought it would rise higher than it did, but that was more likely a cook (me) problem than a recipe problem."
103809,82126,11/24/2004,3,This was very quick and easy to make but it was too salty.  I may try again with less salt bacause it's so quick to get a fresh baked loaf of bread with this recipe.
209747,82126,2/12/2009,5,This bread came out perfectly. Nicely browned crust and fluffy inside. Not too salty at all. The loaf was a great texture and sliced beautifully. Made this in my kitchen aid and it could not have been easier! Thanks Dee!
2001334349,82126,1/2/2017,5,The bread is very good and easy to make. I only used 1 heaping teaspoon of salt instead of the 2 tsp. I will definitely make this again!
138429,98410,12/14/2004,5,I made this a couple of months ago and it is very smooth.I don't hardly ever drink (but did taste this)I am going to try this with 7up or something sparkling. It has a very nice flavor.I will make it again. Thank you!!
245669,98410,12/4/2007,5,What a perfect holiday drink
486032,98410,11/29/2009,5,"I was so exited to try this recipe and it turned out excellent! I let this sit for a month under the sink, shook it every few days and strained it into a decanter for Thanksgiving. I thought the apple theme would go great for the holiday and would be perfect for hot spiked cider. Boy was it ever! Easy and delicious. I think I'm going to make some more and give it away as Christmas gifts. Thank you!"
424680,122397,9/17/2008,4,"With my cooking schedule I was happy to make just half a recipe of these nice tasting scones ~ Nothing fancy, just satisfying! I'd made recipe #219454 #219454 & spread some of it on these for a sweet, satisfying snack! [Tagged, made & reviewed for one of my adopted chefs in the current Pick-A-Chef]"
228569,144440,12/7/2005,4,"I made this from the Kraft Food & Family magazine last week. I was going to post it because we enjoyed it sooo much and then I did a search and here it was! Both my kids loved it, too!"
424680,190338,4/24/2008,4,"This is a nice, easy-t0-make comfort food recipe! Substituted chicken soup for the mushroom, & after adding a cup of green peas, I followed the recipe! Nice, enjoyable! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in this Spring's Pick-A-Chef]"
720889,190338,5/2/2009,5,Easy to make.
1378713,190338,2/8/2010,4,Yum I made this today but substituted the celery with frozen baby peas and used Marble jack cheese and subed the mushroom soup with cream of chicken because that's what I had here. It came out delicious.
201581,193976,3/20/2007,5,"I made these in my Foreman grill and they were cooked in less than 10 minutes, and I grilled pineapple rings sprinkled with a little brown sugar on the side. Served with Recipe #211832 #211832 this made a tasty diabetic meal. Made for Holiday Tag. Thanks for posting!"
68960,193976,4/13/2007,4,"This was a good, basic kid friendly burger that both my young girls enjoyed. I served the Aussie style with pineapple, beets and lettuce. Unfortunately it is hard to get ground Turkey in Australia so instead I used chicken mince. Thanks for sharing."
430471,193976,7/26/2007,4,This was a good basic recipe. I've never had pineapple on a burger and it was very good. I made recipe as is and added a pinch of garlic powder.
483178,213671,4/13/2007,5,This is a yummy answer to my desperate need to add more protein and fiber to my daily diet. I now eat this 2x/day (as breakfast and later as a snack). I use two egg whites and the full amount All-Bran. It is so easy to fix. Goes well with fruit and can be made ahead and transported.  I've left the splenda and cinnamon out occasionally. Then I use 1 tsp butter and 1 tsp cinnamon sugar as a topping.
104295,213671,6/13/2007,4,"This is very healthy and filling and I'm hoping it gives me the energy to get through my workout this morning!  It was super easy to make and cooked beautifully.  That said, it had a bit of a grainy texture and is probably something I'll eat more because it is good for me then because it is delicious.  I can handle that, though!  Thanks for posting."
679759,263254,4/6/2008,5,"This was SO tasty!  My house smelled incredible- my dinner guests were impressed!
The sauce for the pasta was a little less flavorful than I hoped for but the chicken is absolutely to die for!  I will be using the chicken on salads and in tacos that is for sure!  It is an added bonus that the chicken cooks from a frozen state so those nights that you don't think ahead you could make the chicken!
Wonderful recipe!  I will make this one again for sure!
Thanks Zabrina~ Made for PAC Spring 08"
353579,263254,4/22/2008,5,"Just lovely!  The chicken has wonderful flavor - I used about a teaspoon of red pepper, since we like things spicy.  I broke my jar of roasted red peppers, so I left them out.  I also added a lot more cheese - tasted great!  Thanks for sharing!"
1020526,298531,8/1/2009,5,I found this recipe at www.pillsbury.com.  It's the 2004 Bake-off Contest 41 $5000 America's Greatest Cheese Recipe Award winner.  It's a quick way to make a pizza when you're craving pizza but don't want to make your own dough.  I altered it by leaving out the butter completely and putting the pizza sauce together with the spices (I used a marinara sauce) inside instead of just for dipping.  I used prosciuttio in place of the pepperoni because it's what I had.  Very yummy and quick to make.  Thanks for posting this!
428885,312342,9/15/2008,4,"A terrific eggplant casserole! I made this without meat, just using the eggplant in place of the protein and was a wonderfully warm to the soul casserole. I used my own tomato and basil and thyme from the garden. Put a 2 percent cheddar cheese and baked it easily in the oven. Quick and the taste fabulous! Enjoyed this a lot and will use again. Thank you, lena! Made for PAC 2008."
116856,312342,5/28/2012,4,"This dish was tasty but I added extra onion,peppers,tomatoes and seaonings. Next time I would add garlic, zuchinni and parmean cheese to the meat mixture. I served the casserole over some plain rice."
2000498330,325995,2/23/2016,5,I made these in the slow cooker. Delicious tangy sweet sauce. Super easy.
1011387,332462,11/2/2008,5,These are some TASTY enchiladas! They are the best I've ever tasted!
185142,332462,11/8/2008,2,Kind of bland. I won't be making again.
1122487,332462,1/10/2009,3,"Easier than making fresh with fresh tomatillos, but cheddar cheese on Mexican food ruins it and obscures the delicate flavors.  Use queso fresco or even better, hard queso blanco, which you just crumble on top.  It's more authentic and more flavorgul."
554827,364973,4/8/2009,5,This may sound very strange--but it is SO good!!  Outstanding
567392,364973,4/28/2009,0,"I cannot W.A.I.T. to try this!  This reminds me of what my grandma use to make.  I wasn't crazy about gravy, but CHOCOLATE gravy...that's another story!!  Now, I have kiddos, I might try it out on them :)  Thank you SO much.  I'll update once I make it!"
242766,364973,11/8/2012,5,"Boy, I sure missed out on a yummy treat when I was a kid!  I had never heard of chocolate gravy before, so I wasn't too sure of what to expect. We really enjoyed the saltiness of the biscuit with the sweet from the chocolate gravy...yum!  I used whole milk and cooked the chocolate for about 15 minutes before it got thick.  Also, I used Pillsbury Grands buttermilk biscuits instead of homemade biscuits.  Thank you for sharing this tasty, sweet treat.<br/>**Made for PAC Fall 2012**"
424680,410716,3/6/2010,5,"As long as it wasn't cooked spinach, I was happy to try it in this smoothie, though I did think it an odd combination! Still, the flavor combo really hit the spot! I did use frozen bananas to give it a frosty chill & thickness! Definitely a do-again kind of recipe ~ Thanks for sharing it! [Made & reviewed in New Kids on the Block tag]"
253974,424107,10/26/2010,5,"I love red skinned potatoes, and now I love them even more! What a tasty recipe! This will go with just about everything! Who can't use another potatoe recipe????? Thanks for sharing Sharon! A keeper for sure! Made for Sharon 123's Cookathon at the forums at KK's site!"
804550,424107,10/31/2010,5,My daughter announced at the dinner table that she was giving this recipe 5-Stars and the rest of us all agreed! It was definitely a tasty dish. I topped it with white Asiago cheese as that was what I had on hand. Made for the Memorial Cookathon for Sharon's DH.
560491,424107,5/17/2011,5,"These were so easy to make and were a great side dish.  I forgot the chives, and used regular bacon rather than veggie but otherwise made as directed.  Will make these again!  Made for PRMR."
2002188457,456310,6/18/2018,5,"Hello, This is my first time ever that I made a semita de pi&ntilde;a. I made it for my son-in-law. I followed your recipe. I couldn’t find pineapple jam or preserves, so I used crushed pineapple, mixed it with apricot jam. My son-in-law who is from El Salvador loves it."
255692,460202,7/13/2011,0,I fixed these as soon as I saw them on Smoking meat.com. Hands down the best chicken I have ever fixed<br/><br/>Read more: http://www.food.com/mail/view?msgid=3674672#ixzz1S1FxaBxY
226863,460202,10/8/2011,5,"Delicious smokey flavor!  I used a mix of hickory and applewood....very nice flavor.  I used low sodium, 25% lower fat bacon to try and reduce some fat calories, and these turned out delicious.  I only had to cook my breasts for 1 hour 10 minutes over indirect heat to get them smokey, tender, and juicy. Thanks for sharing! Made for PAC Fall 2011."
1072593,460202,6/16/2012,5,bacon...bacon...bacon!  I love bacon! Made in memory of the beloved Papa D.
2741346,460202,3/17/2013,5,Excellent smokey flavor (I used applewood) and the bacon really helps keep the chicken moist.  My first attempt at smoking and it worked brilliantly!  I&#039;m proud they came out looking a lot like Papa D&#039;s.
2001447989,460202,6/2/2017,5,Made this exactly as written and it was fantastic. I just recently started dabbling in smoking and this was my favorite by far. it took about 3 hours with my smoker temp hovering around 225 (pretty large pieces of meat).
2001631636,460202,7/18/2017,5,I made a few alterations to this dish. First was i allowed the chicken to sit in the brine for about 6 hours before i started cooking it. Second i made some honey bbq sauce for the sauce and a good chicken rub for the base. Cooking was only about an hour and 20 mins was delicious and moist. Next time ill use a lower heat to try and infuse more of the apple wood smokey flavor. All in all it was amazing and ill definitely be making it again.
2002045948,460202,3/12/2018,5,"Excellent recipe! Followed it fairly close, with only some deviation on my times for brine &amp; smoke. Smoked with apple wood in my masterbuilt 40. Had a couple friends over for dinner &amp; got great kudos from everyone! Breasts stayed moist &amp; we're very flavorful. Used Kinder's roasted garlic BBQ sauce to baste &amp; spade L ranch chicken seasoning for my rub. Had to throw some worcestershire on before I rubbed the chicken down because I rarely smoke without it. Overall A+!"
2002215452,460202,7/12/2018,5,This is the best chicken we’ve ever had. My husband has outdone himself once again using this recipe.
1677099,475793,3/7/2012,5,Whodathunk?  That pinch of kosher salt makes a difference....a good one.
59064,26762,4/21/2004,5,"Great idea for pasta which was very enjoyable. I would consider adding avocado to this as well as a green salad.
Even the three year old ate this without complaint!"
166711,26762,12/24/2004,5,"Super idea!  I also had a bunch of pistachios that I had no idea what to do with.  Their quality was iffy, so I didn't want to put them in a cookie...  

I used dried onion flakes since I was out of onions and I fried the ingredients in olive oil.  I also added Classico pesto sauce and some parmesan.  SO yummy!  

I usually prefer a hearty beef/tomato sauce with my pasta and rarely make pesto, but I definitely will make this on a regular basis.  Thanks!  "
95743,26762,5/3/2005,5,Just wonderful.  I used the basil pesto and there was clamoring for more than I made of this tasty pasta.  What a great idea - pasta and pistacios.
288704,26762,2/6/2006,5,"Great Recipe :) My husband cooked it for me and he didnt add the pesto sauce. I love it, and will try it next time with the sauce and a glass of wine ;)"
395252,26762,4/22/2008,5,"Wow, what a wonderful surprise! My other half and I have ""swapped roles"" this week so I'm on washing up and he's on dinner. He has free reign over the menu and picked this little winner to make last night. I have to say, I was dubious to begin with (not being accustomed to nuts with pasta) but this was really good. The flavours came together wonderfully and it was spot on. He stirred through 2tbsp pesto at the end which finished it off nicely. My only comments would be that a quoted amount of pesto would be helpful (I had to advise him of how much to use) and also the pistachios were a nightmare to shell, but that's hardly the recipe's fault! Delicious and we'll definitely be having it again! Thanks!"
273846,60234,11/7/2009,5,"this was delicious and so easy to put together.  I made it this morning and one loaf is over half gone.  It's not too sweet but has enough sweet and chocolate to cure a craving.  Made for My 3 Chefs, fall 2009."
310908,90230,9/16/2006,4,"The brown rice crust is a really great idea, and I was actually surprized that everything came out layered and nice and firm.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I didn't have any parmesan and I made it in a 8x8 pan.  Next time I will probably add some salt and pepper, and maybe some green onion or cilantro with the spinach.  BTW, it was super easy!  Thanks!"
13483,90230,9/21/2006,4,"Very easy to do and made a great main course for dinner.  Will enjoy the ""planed overs"" tomorrow.  Thanks megano o"
8377,90230,1/24/2010,5,"This is very good. I liked it served at room temperature. I made a tweak: To the spinach, I added the juice and zest of a medium-size lemon, giving it a Mediterranian flare. I had to use white rice because I was out of brown. Since this is so easy to make, and I think fool-proof, I'll make this often. I want to try the rice crust with other fillings like south western, or summer veggies. Thanks!"
2014423,90230,9/22/2011,4,"While it turned out better than I had anticipated, I was still luke-warm about the rice-based pie crust and would probably try the recipe again in a flour-based pie crust. The filling was delicious, however! I made a few modifications to the filling: only used 2 eggs instead of 3, added 1/4 cup of swiss, added a little salt and nutmeg."
1366815,90230,9/23/2011,5,I always use this crust for quiche.  We all love it.  I frequently make a spinach quiche in it with a few mushrooms added--yum!
160974,119804,8/6/2005,5,"I was in the mood for something light for a snack  and this was just the right choice. Quick to mix up and only requiring 2 tablespoons oil, the only change I made was using buttermilk for the yogurt.It bakes up quicker than a traditional banana bread  which allowed it to make a quick dessert.  The cake baked up very light but with a good denseness that cut neatly. I served it plain and it went great with a cup of tea. Thanks Kittencal!

Roxygirl"
209441,119804,8/28/2005,5,WOW this cake was so very good and moist. I increased the sugar. thanks KITTENCAL
133174,119804,3/27/2006,5,"This makes a nice quick cake and is perfect for a small family.  I didn't think you banana was ripe enough to give a really good flavor so instead of the vanilla, I used banana flavoring.  For the sugar, I used 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 white sugar.  The cake was moist and delicious.  I topped it off with Creamy Peanut Butter Frosting Recipe #111131 
by CoolMonday."
129652,119804,4/10/2006,4,"This looked nice and had a light texture.  I did use whole wheat pastry flour, which turned out fine.  It's definitely not overly sweet.  It would definitely be helped by a sweet frosting.  I'm not planning on making it again, though.  "
100185,119804,5/13/2006,5,"Moist and fluffy, just right for a snack cake.  I didn't frost it because my silly kitties (well, the youngest 2) insisted on sharing it with me.  Anytime I have very ripe bananas I will probably turn to this recipe."
168462,119804,5/18/2006,5,This was tasty and easy to prepare. I did not have any yogurt on hand so I used low fat sour cream and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe
50151,119804,5/30/2006,5,This was great.  A nice change from banana bread.  I toped it with cream cheese frosting (recipe #55530) and we thought it was perfect!  So simple to make.
33159,119804,7/8/2006,5,"AWESOME!!  I decided to make this cake because I had some bananas to use up & this recipe is very low in fat when you use fat-free yogurt (which I did).  But, I expected it to be barely edible but good for me.  Was I pleasantly surprised!!  This cake is so rich & moist & fabulous.  I didn't even frost or sprinkle with sugar. And, since it is so low in fat, I've been eating a piece for breakfast every day.  Next time I may just make muffins with this recipe."
269891,119804,10/4/2006,5,"Delicious! Didn't use frosting, just a light dusting of powdered sugar.  I spent the whole weekend snacking on it. So did my husband and he's not big on banana baked goods.  "
241140,119804,1/6/2007,5,"WOW - these were fabulous - the end of the search for the perfect banana low fat muffin.  We made these into muffins and topped them with chopped walnuts.  They have such great texture for a low fat muffin - very cake like, not rubbery.  Thanks!"
323389,119804,1/14/2007,4,"I liked this cake alot, and even added 1/2 cup chocolate chips at the end.  I frosted it with the peanut butter frosting that a previous reviewer used.  On a completely different note: I thought my pan was 9x9 but it must be an 8x8 because I baked my cake for 30 minutes and it appeared done (golden brown and pulling away from the sides) but when I cut into it it was undercooked in the middle. SO either I need to buy another pan or cook even longer..."
260911,119804,2/20/2007,5,"Mmmm, yummy - even without frosting! Nice and moist. I subbed applesauce for half of the yogurt."
49542,119804,3/24/2007,5,"Yummy and moist, IMO, didn't need any frosting but I made a bit of icing using confectioner's sugar and amaretto spead on the warm cake to soak in.  Also used about a tablespoon of amaretto in the cake batter itself.  Delicious and was gone in less than 24 hours.  I really appreciated this being a smaller size as there is just two of us.  We can eat the whole thing and not feel too guilty!"
67961,119804,3/25/2007,5,outstanding with very little effort...kids loved it.
314825,119804,4/17/2007,4,"Easy to make and good tasting cake. I used low fat vanilla yogurt (did not have plain). My cake came out much darker looking then on the picture,probably beacuse of very ripe bananas I used and cinnamon. Would make it again,but next time will add nuts, it was lacking a texture."
497609,119804,5/9/2007,5,This cake is really good. Its hard to find a low fat recipe that tastes good. I substituted vanilla yoghurt instead of plain (like another reader mentined)as that's all I had. I did need to cook it about 15 minutes longer as it was not cooked after 25mins. I also added sultanas which worked well. Thank you kittencal for this great recipe.
141293,119804,6/7/2007,5,"This was a quick and delicious dessert.  I used ff vanilla yogurt and topped it with Recipe #111131, using chocolate peanut butter.  Banana, chocolate, peanut butter and cinnamon.  Great combination.  Also added chopped pecans to the batter and toffee bits on top!"
57222,119804,7/4/2007,4,"Lovely snack cake: easy to whip up and a delight to eat! I baked the cake some 5 minutes longer and might add a minute or two more the next time. I either didn't whisk or stir well enough, as I had wet bits of mashed banana here and there in the cake - better work on my technique!! ;-) Thanks for the recipe Kittencal!"
195750,119804,8/2/2007,5,I made this cake with lite sour cream in place of the yogurt and it worked out fine.  I cut the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. because I wanted the banana flavor to really shine through.  It is excellent and I love that it is low fat.  Thanks for posting.
247362,119804,9/8/2007,5,"Kittencal,
I've never gone wrong with any of your recipes. This was a delightfully light snack cake that takes only a few minutes to put together. I make my own yogurt and used the low fat (skim milk) version also the half cup of sugar was plenty for our tastes. This is a great cake for hurried weeknight dinners and leftovers for the lunch box the next day. The entire family asked for this one again. Thanks for sharing!"
57101,119804,9/25/2007,5,"EXCELLENT, MOIST and hard to believe it's low fat.  I used low fat sour cream rather than yogurt.  Also glazed it with thin powdered sugar glaze.  We will continue to make this cake!"
91392,119804,10/1/2007,5,"More than 5 stars.  I will make this again and again.  Just a few notes so I can do it again.  I doubled the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan, no problem at all, in fact, it rose very tall.  Cooked in about 35-40 minutes in a convection oven.  I used part whole wheat flour and a/2 sugar, 1/2 Splenda, only 1 tsp cinnamon for the doubled cake.  2 small French yogurt containers, I used fat free = 1 cup.  I tossed in some mini chocolate chips, just because I had them and frosted with light cream cheese frosting.  I took it to tea at a friend's house and they kept all the leftovers, not what I was planning.  Really really extremely nice, got to be one of my top 10 here at Zaar. And such a simple thing too."
60992,119804,10/13/2007,5,"Another fantastic Kittencal recipe!! I used low fat sour cream and it did not seem to affect the cake at all, it rose nice and high and was incredibly moist. The banana and cinnamon flavors are exquisite together, I would have never thought it to be so. I do have to mention I did break a spatula during the folding...so I gently used a wire whisk instead. I topped this cake with a browned butter glaze and it was absolutely delectable."
551470,119804,12/5/2007,5,"I cant believe I didnt review this!! I thought I did....anyways, I made this into mini muffins and it was great! I added some chopped almonds to the mix just for some texture and it was so great. I made one batch without a topping and another batch with a broiled sugar and nut topping. It was so good and nobody guessed it was low fat until I mentioned it and all of a sudden all my muffins were gone by the end of the day! :)
** Just wondering if anyone's tried making this with low fat buttermilk instead of yogurt?**"
137911,119804,1/7/2008,5,"Very, very moist cake!  We loved it!  I didn't have plain yogurt so I used a sugar-free banana yogurt I happened to have.  Turned out fine.  Thanks for posting."
169430,119804,2/26/2008,5,"Wonderful. I made it in a heart pan to honor the fact that it's very heart healthy. I used 3/4 cup of Splenda for the sugar, 1/2 cup of fat free sour cream that I needed to use and 1/2 a cup of the plain fat free yogurt and 1/4 cup of egg white. OK, I admit to using a ""generous"" tsp of cinnamon and I sprinkled my slice with Splenda cinnamon. It's very moist, tender something that everyone in the family will love. It's very easy to make and starts rising before you can get it out of the bowl and into the pan. Thank you so much Kittzen!"
165206,119804,3/6/2008,5,"The best low fat cake ever! Moist and wonderful, not too sweet (I only used 1/2 cup sugar since all I had was a sweetened vanilla yogurt). Was tempted, REALLY TEMPTED to top with cream cheese icing but opted the lower fat dusting of powdered sugar.
Thanks  Kitten!"
354675,119804,3/6/2008,5,"Perfection! Made this for my two little monkeys when we had brown bananas and needed some excitement on a humdrum weeknight. Why would you ever make a full fat version when this is so moist, decadent, and rich? We are in love and this is now our new go to when the bananas turn brown. Thanks Kitten!"
493835,119804,5/6/2008,5,"THis is awesome! Very moist and tastes good. Easy to make too. 
One funny thing. The pic that I say (pic 5) showed a very flat cake so I uses a pie pan...well if puffed up a lot and got all over my oven, but that was just my fault. Other then the mess (user error) the rest is super yummy."
382071,119804,5/11/2008,4,"This was a GREAT healthier banana cake! I made it with whole wheat flour, Splenda, nonfat yogurt and added banana extract. I also made a banana frosting but it was good without it too. I liked it much better chilled in the fridge. Made for the Zaar Stars tag game."
848785,119804,5/30/2008,5,This is a great banana cake and definitely a keeper. Thanks kittencal.
366385,119804,7/3/2008,5,"Oh my, I LOVE this cake as does my 2yr old! Funny though, mine was actually a bit of a disaster. I tried doubling the recipe and using a 9 by 13 pan (as another reviewer had used) but mine overflowed and the edges were way done before the middle. So I salvaged what I could around the sides and we have enjoyed every yummy bite. Next time I will stick to the original serving size. Thank you so much for an excellent recipe! I cannot wait to try it out again!!"
226066,119804,7/7/2008,5,"Kit - this is TOO GOOD!! and simple too!!  Used some ""old"" bananas and used low-fat vanilla yogurt.  Added only about 1/2 cup of sugar (and would lower it even more next time!). Baked it for about 20 minutes and it was PERFECT.  Thanks Kit! :)"
546012,119804,7/15/2008,5,"made this with 2 bananas, fat free sour cream, a dash of nutmeg, a dash of cloves, and melted butter instead of oil (i was out!). it baked up very nicely, and smelled delicious! i'm giving it as a present, so i can't attest to the taste - but how could you go wrong??? 
thanks so much!"
441981,119804,7/22/2008,5,"I used 1 cup bread flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (i didn't have regular all purpose) and fage greek yogurt full fat. i also used 2 bananas, which was closer to 1 cup. The texture was a bit chewy and very moist, probably because of the flour and extra bananas, but we love the flavor! i will make this again for sure."
919613,119804,8/11/2008,5,This recipe is very moist.  I used 2 medium-sized bananas and only 1/2 cup sugar.  It'd taste great with tea!
604139,119804,9/28/2008,5,"Delicious. I halved the recipe (since I only had one small banana that was ripe enough). In doing so, I altered the halved ingredients by using 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup unbleached flour, just under 1/4 cup sugar, one whole egg, and 1/2 cup nonfat plain yogurt. I will definitely make this again, and encourage others to make it as well!"
139930,119804,12/6/2008,5,"In memory 2008.  Yummy!  So moist with a hint of cinnamon.  Quick, easy and I had almost everything on hand to make it.  I did sub the yogurt for full fat sour cream.  I left it right in the baking pan and did not top it with anything.  It was delicious and most of it eaten before it cooled!  Thanks for yet another winner in my home!"
485335,119804,1/13/2009,5,"WOW! This was a wonderful surprise. I usually have difficuly with lower fat baked goods being dry or having a 'spongy' texture. This cake was light, fluffy and very moist. I actually baked them into muffins and my family devoured them in one day!"
394077,119804,1/30/2009,5,Very moist and delicious cake.  I didn't have any yogurt or light sour cream so I used regular sour cream.  So much for being low-fat but it was excellent.:) It was worth it.
1093291,119804,1/30/2009,5,"I made muffins for work. I doubled the recipe, using sour cream in lieu of yogart.  Made 24 regular size muffins which needed to bake 25 minutes in my oven.  They were a lovely golden brown . I had sprayed the muffin tins with Pam (no liners) and they came out very easily without sticking. They were a big hit at my office."
628076,119804,2/2/2009,5,"Excellent cake!! I have made it two days in a row and changed it up just a bit each day. I subbed 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for ap flour, sour cream for yogurt and i added 2 tbsp wheat germ the first day. The second day again with the wheat flour, sour cream and wheat germ ... but I also subbed brown sugar for white and added 1 cup chopped walnuts. Great breakfast both days!! Both days it did take 30 minutes+ to bake."
514022,119804,2/5/2009,5,"So yummy!! My kids helped me make this, as I doubled the recipe.  This made an 8x8 cake, and 18 muffins. This had great flavor, and hit the spot. They were sweet, but not too sweet. The banana flavor was very subtle. I also added a little bit of cinnamon/sugar mix on top of both the cake and muffins."
189788,119804,2/8/2009,5,"I was very impressed by the texture of this cake.  I enjoy doing low fat baking, but there is usually more of a texture change.  I used only 1/2 of a cup of sugar since I used sweetened light vanilla yogurt.  I also topped with pecans which toasted nicely in the oven.  We enjoyed this for breakfast with tea.  Thanks!"
217908,119804,3/16/2009,5,"Well, after 40-something 4 and 5 star reviews, there isn't much to add.  I just wanted to thank you, once again, for a great recipe, Kittencal.  This cake was really easy to throw together, and baked up nice, light and fluffy in exactly 25 minutes at 350.  Perfect!  I wanted to bake up a low fat sweet snack, and had to make do with what I had on hand.  This recipe certainly fit the bill."
457907,119804,4/21/2009,5,"This is great. Very light and fluffy. I was surprised that the texture wasn't dense. I used 1/2 nonfat vanilla yogurt and 1/2 light sour cream (it's what I had). Thanks! 2nd time around used container of Banana Cream Pie yogurt and some ff sour cream, 1/2 c. ww flour and 1 c. flour & splenda in place of sugar.  I made it as a cake this time and made Peanut Butter Frosting using 1/2 c. Reduced Fat PB and 1/2 c. powdered sugar with some skim.  Awesome!!"
444132,119804,6/1/2009,5,"Absolutely delish!!  These were so moist and tasty, and very easy to make.  I added 1/2 cup pecans, and baked up a dozen muffins, which took around 20 minutes to bake.  Kitt, thanks for sharing another one of your excellent recipes!"
158086,119804,8/3/2009,5,fantastic recipe Kittencal!  I doubled it and put it in a bundt pan.  I also used splenda and used vanilla yogurt...It turned out great!  Thanks...
298981,119804,1/31/2014,5,"YUMMY!!  I just made these for breakfast and they were DELICIOUS!!! I did  have to use some pumpkin to replace some of the banana since I only had one banana that I had in the freezer. (Bananas don&#039;t last long around our house....I think a bunch of monkeys live here)  Anyway, about 1/2 of the banana was replaced with pumpkin.  I also added 1/2 cup oatmeal for some texture and used all whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.  They are definitely something I will be making often!  Thanks for the great recipe!"
470351,119804,8/23/2009,5,"Oh my heavens...SO WONDERFUL for such a light cake!!!!  We LOVED it!  I was trying to use up ripe banana's and came across this recipe because it had the lowest amount of sugar required of any other banana bread (I was almost completely out of sugar!) recipe.  I used lowfat vanilla yogurt and had to sub a small amount of brown sugar in to make my 1/2 cup of sugar.  This was outstanding!  Super moist, super tasty and not at all lowfat tasting!  My kids each had two helping of this for breakfast (which NEVER happens!) and my husband I also declared this one a true winner.  Kitten...you've done it again!  LOVED IT!"
531310,119804,8/25/2009,5,"This is so delicious, hard to believe it is low-fat.  We loved this and I will make this again.  I used low fat sour cream and it turned out perfect!"
1159243,119804,10/30/2009,5,"Fantastic recipe! I made muffins earlier this week & am making a cake for my grandma now. This recipe was so simple, thank you for sharing. They taste so good, I can't believe that they are low fat."
755020,119804,12/7/2009,5,"Made this using light sour cream, and it turned out great!  Made it as 12 muffins and baked for 20 minutes."
457321,119804,1/2/2010,5,"Awesome!  I didn't have quite enough banana, so I put in a little milk.  I used half Greek yogurt with honey and half Greek vanilla flavored yogurt, and cut the sugar down to less than 1/2 cup.  It was a huge hit with no extra adornment.  Thanks for a simple, delicious solution to what to do with that one overly-brown banana!"
111291,119804,1/5/2010,5,"yum!  super moist snack!!  i used only 1/3 c. of loosely packed brown sugar and then added a thick sprinkle of cinnamon sugar and some quick oats on top.  i didn't have fat-free yogurt, so i used 1 c. buttermilk.  i didn't measure the banana, but i only had one and that's what i used.  turned out great.  next time i make it, i will use natural applesauce in place of the oil.  thanks for a healthy and delish recipe!"
1293714,119804,3/8/2010,5,"These were so delicious! I made them into mini muffins and used 1cup of strawberry yogurt and less than 1/2 cup of sugar. They were moist and not too sweet. Everyone loved them and didn't even know they were low fat. They were fantastic, thank you so much for this great recipe!"
1627976,119804,6/5/2010,0,I made muffins and they were really excellent! I used low fat sour cream and 1/2 of flour amount was whole wheat. I also added about 1/2 each of mini chocolate chips and chopped walnuts. They were moist and flavorful.
1275428,119804,6/18/2010,5,Another 5 star recipe from you! Thank you. I used sour cream instead of yogurt. My girls and hubby put a little almond butter frosting on top...pretty much pb frosting with almondbutter instead of pb.  I'm trying to lose weight so I enjoyed the cake plain. Super yummy.
48196,119804,12/3/2010,5,"I am always looking for healthier snack and dessert recipes for the diabetic in my house.  This recipe was wonderful!  I used Splenda instead of sugar, and it came out so moist and fluffy and nicely-risen.  I've not had much luck in the past adapting recipes by substituting Splenda, as many recipes turn out flat or dry, but I was very pleasantly surprised this time!  The whole family enjoyed this.  I know I will be making this again and again.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!"
561908,119804,4/27/2011,5,"This was a great recipe, so moist, so perfect.  I wasnt looking for a lowfat recipe this just worked for what I had in my house, and I figured if Kittencal posted it and 60 others love it, it must be good.  You would never know it was low fat, in fact it is better than some full-fat banana breads Ive had.  I used almond extract instead of the vanilla, but not as much.  It was soo goood. Thank you for posting :)"
50711,119804,11/13/2011,0,These are great tasting and very easy to make.  I used fat free banana cream yogurt as that's what I had and I also put walnuts in the batter.  This made 9 generous sized muffins which took about 20 minutes to bake.  They're nice and moist and have great banana flavor.  Thanks Kittencal
2536375,119804,12/7/2012,4,"I made this into twelve regular size muffins instead of a cake. I used regular plain yogurt since that is what I had on had. That made them higher in fat content, but they were so good warm with a glass of milk. My muffins were done in about 16 - 17 minutes. Next time I will add a bit more cinnamon-personal preference- and perhaps a few pecans, walnuts or raisins. This recipe is a keeper!"
363055,119804,6/12/2013,5,My favorite way to use ripe bananas.  I frost with chocolate frosting.  Will make this often!!
717221,119804,9/30/2013,5,"Divine! Airy, soft and moist. Just the perfect amount of sweetness for me with the 1/2 cup of sugar."
666681,119804,2/15/2014,5,Made this while here in Hawaii using apple bananas. This was nice and moist and we loved that it used so little oil. I used vanilla yogurt. Next time I will add walnuts and might even modify it changing the spices and replace the bananas for pumpkin or applesauce.
1802647601,119804,4/6/2014,5,"This recipe was so delicious! I used Low-Fat vanilla yogurt and omitted the sugar, using closer to a cup of mashed banana rather than 3/4 of a cup. It made the cake extra moist and fluffy, and who doesn&#039;t like more bananas?!. I also sprinkled the top with light brown sugar which looked and tasted beautiful. I cut it into 9 big pieces at only 123.5 calories a piece!!"
1547166,119804,5/15/2014,4,yummy recipes
1179225,119804,6/22/2014,5,This was a great way to get a little sweet without a ton of fat and calories. I loved how quick and easy it was to mix up. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
32772,119804,9/1/2014,5,This recipe was easy to make. Followed the directions as written. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel topping.
651350,119804,9/22/2014,5,"Very Good and Gluten-Free Friendly.  I was able to substitute my gluten free flour by weight.  It was necessary to bake it a little longer, but it was tasty and very moist."
1803384077,119804,11/22/2014,5,"great recipe! very easy and healthy. can be done on the other side of the ocean, in Ukraine. thank you!"
1803212001,119804,8/7/2015,5,This cake is fabulous. Everyone I have served it too loves it. Coconut yogurt works great. And sometimes I put different toppings on it too. Once I used pecans and butterscotch chips. Today I&#039;m using coconut and choc chips. Also I ran out of flour so sub in some oats as part of the flour.  It looks great so far. Taste test later
2001495244,119804,4/18/2017,5,"Loved it. I tweeked it though for a low carb desert Changed to coconut flour and 1tbs if flax meal. Splenda instead of sugar, Used oikos zero yogurt just added 2tbs of almond milk and extra tsp of oil. Ps I used olive oil &quot;what I had on hand&quot;. Came out yummy"
2001676998,119804,8/18/2017,5,Wow. This was suprisingly delicious! I used coconut flour instead of plain and only 1/4 cup of sugar. I also added 1/2 cup of blueberries to the mix. They don't look that fabulous but far out they taste yum. I will be doing these often. Thanks
107635,126877,6/24/2005,4,"Lene, You've got a new fan here.  I hope to getting around to reviewing many of your recipes. This one is quick, easy and delicious, and I imagine bumping it up with homemade pasta when time is not an issue. "
364685,147246,4/1/2007,3,"This was a good, easy dinner that, although it was tasty, didn't really excite us. I churched it up a little by tossing some steamed asparagus and broccoli with the pasta and butter. And I couldn't resist adding some garlic powder to the cheese mixture. I think if I make this in the future, I will definitely add more garlic powder and maybe play around with the other seasonings to make it more our style."
527607,147246,3/4/2008,5,"I loved this, make sure you use good quality italian pasta and real parmagiannao reggiano - not the kraft or powdered garbage, to get the real flavors of this dish.

Simple and delicious"
80353,170922,6/6/2006,5,The only thing I didn't do was add the water to the olive oil.  Everything else was followed exactly.  Delicious salad.  Authentically Greek.  Loved the bite of the pepperoncini peppers.  Thanks!
102058,170922,6/16/2006,4,"Elmo... We LIKED this.. refreshing  salad, tasty and healthy. I didn't add the hot peppers as we are not used to too much heat, but did follow the rest of the recipe to the letter. I will make this again during the summer... please see my rating system an excellent 4 stars :) Thanks !"
37449,170922,7/19/2006,4,"This made a nice lunch.  I halved the recipe, Thank you Bethie!"
174711,170922,7/20/2006,5,Excellent village salad! Very simple to make and SO good. Thanks!
325909,170922,3/5/2007,5,"Loved this salad. The only way I changed the recipe was using the juice of half a lemon whisked into the olive oil ""dressing."" And I skipped the T. of water. I'm liable to make this 2 or three times a month, especially when hot weather gets here!"
133174,170922,2/7/2008,5,This is absolutely my favorite salad!  The recipe was reduced to 2 servings and made as written.
154853,170922,2/15/2008,4,"This recipe is excellent.  I will make it often.  Will omit the green pepper, just out of personal preference. Will also omit the water and serve it with a lemon vinaigrette."
424680,170922,6/14/2008,5,"Did a little tweaking on this, but not much ~ Just used 1/2 of a green bell pepper, & then served the pepperoncini peppers on the side, for those who like it HOT! A very TASTY SALAD, & it'll be worth keeping the recipe around! [Made & reviewed while in Greece on the Zaar World Tour 4]"
522099,170922,6/17/2008,5,This was my personal choice for the winner of our Greek Salad war last night.  The freshness of ingredients and flavor of the seasoning and oil - just wonderful.  I used combination of black and green olives and pepperoncini rings 'cause that's what I had on hand.  I'm going to enjoy leftovers for lunch today.  A perfect side dish or light meal.  Made for Daffy Daffodils ZWT4
192581,170922,6/18/2008,5,"GREAT!  Served as a vegetarian main meal.  Added red wine vinegar to serve and ate in a warmed pita.  Liked the fact that olive oil amounts were optional, so we added 1 tbsp or so to our tastes.  This was so good I will add to my fast but tasty cookbook. Yummy!"
168462,170922,6/27/2008,5,"This is awesome. I chose not to add any oil, salt or water. I have made this twice and both times my husband devoured it. I ran out of cucumber and subbed some snow peas and it was still good. This is easy to make and filled with flavour. Thanks for the recipe."
29196,170922,11/4/2008,4,"A colourful and tasty salad. I like the fact we always have the ingredients for this sort of salad on hand. I had big fruity green olives, but think I would have preferred kalmata in this,"
463435,170922,3/9/2010,4,Made this to go along with our roast for dinner tonight. I did add the veggies to a little bit of a mixed greens lettuce blend in order to sneak it by as a salad. The only other change I made was I subbed fresh squeezed lemon juice for the water. I will definitely make this again. Made and reviewed for the 38th AUS/NZ Recipe Swap.
498271,170922,7/19/2013,5,"Wow this is a wonderful salad!  I don&#039;t care for raw onion so left it out and used grape tomatoes, halved.  When adding the cheese and olives before serving, I just added more oregano and salt and didn&#039;t add the additional olive oil and water.  This was great served with dinner a few hours after making; served the next day in a pita for lunch and it was really outstanding!  Thanks for sharing a keeper!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
47559,170922,7/27/2013,5,"I loved the combination of all these ingredients and didn&#039;t miss the lettuce at all.  For our taste, we needed a little more tart though, so I sprinkled some wine vinegar on the salad and it was perfect.  Made for Mike and the Appliance Killers ZWT9."
482376,170922,3/13/2014,5,"Loved this! I followed all directions except for adding water to the olive oil. I also included some romaine lettuce (I know it&#039;s not authenic, but it&#039;s the way we like it). Absolutely delicous. I really loved and was completely satisfied by the simple dressing of olive oil, oregano and salt. Great combination of flavors. Thank you!"
366995,230619,11/17/2008,5,"This was really good. Forget about a snack. We had it for breakfast. I did this the lazy lady way. I used ground cumin. Didn't bone or peel the sardines, just flaked it as is. I used whole wheat bread. I also just sprinkled garlic powder on the bread. I could not figure out how to rub garlic on toast without making a mess. I just chopped up the tomatoes without peeling them. Thanks for posting."
169969,316974,8/22/2008,5,This rub was so very good!!! We devoured dinner and I ate the rest this afternoon for lunch. I did add sauce (homemade) to the crockpot as they cooked but the rub made all the difference. These will be made again! Thanks January Bride.
138429,316974,4/13/2009,5,"A great ""rib rub""  I used this recipe with recipe#303245.  The mixture was so easy to put together and the the flavor was excellent. 
Combining the two recipes  made for  a winning dish.   will certainly use this recipe again. 
Made for AUS/NZ swap#27"
703023,316974,9/5/2010,5,"I have used this recipe a few times now and keep forgetting to rate it, sorry! This is by far the best rib rub recipe I have found. The lime juice and zest is what makes it soooooo good. Delish! Thanks for sharing!"
28177,322371,10/11/2009,4,"For taste, this is definitely a 5 star, but there are some instructions missing so I had to do some guessing.  There is no mention of the onion or celery in the instructions so I just put them in the crock pot with the pork butt.  I had 2 pounds of meat but did not alter any other ingredient.  Fresh from the crock this was quite spicy, but after refrigerating overnight for tonight's dinner, it mellowed & was not at all spicy.  I think we'd enjoy this best right in between those two levels so in the future I would add more spices for more meat or if I'm making ahead again.  Very easy recipe & it smelled delicious all day!  We served it tonight with flour tortillas, chopped tomato, green onion, lettuce, sour cream, salsa & 4-cheese Mexican blend.  I loved that the meat did not dry out like past recipes we've tried.  Thanks for sharing, Rachael!  Made & enjoyed for the Fall 2009 PAC-O."
1617537,322371,6/8/2011,3,I did it with the chicken and wasn't that impressed.  Gonna try it again with the roast.
302689,426798,6/5/2010,5,"Thanks Magpie, this was delicious! I normally shy away from cooking with TVP as I find whenever I do it doesn't taste 'right' but I wanted to give this one a go :) I am very happy to report that this time the TVP has rave reviews! The seasonings in the 'schmeat balls', as we call them, are perfect. The sauce was good also but I added a few drops of liquid smoke as I find I need it whenever I use nutritional yeast otherwise I can't stomach the flavour. All up this was a very successful recipe here at my house.  DH goes as far as to rate it 5 1/2 stars ;)
Made for my fellow Vagabond ZWT 6"
293410,426798,6/28/2010,5,"These are awesome! We like TVP a lot in my house, and little bro thought it was just *so* cool to be eating Swedish food. ;) We served with mashed potatoes and salad for a super-delish meal. Thanks for posting! Made for Zingo, ZWT 6."
803511,426798,6/30/2010,4,"My DH and I are not vegans but we do eat mostly chicken and tofu so I thought trying a recipe with TVP might be another alternative we could add into our diet.  We were pleasantly surprised by the flavor of this meal.  I followed the recipe exactly and added quite a bit of salt, pepper, and Braggs to the sauce at the end. The ""meatballs"" seemed a bit soft but the flavor was great.  I don't know if this was my fault or if the TVP/bread crumb combo just creates that soft texture.  That was my DH's only negative comment.  He even asked for a slice of bread to sop up all his left over sauce.  Thanks for taking me on a new culinary experience!"
220348,426798,7/1/2010,5,I tried TVP or nutritional yeast once before and found that it works well in all kinds of recipes. This was no exception. It was nice to get away from the meat and chicken recipes for one day. And this was one recipe that worked well for the family.
226863,426798,7/1/2010,4,"I guess if I was a vegan, I might rate this a 5.....but I am definitely a carnivore, so I missed the texture and taste of meat!  That being said, they have a very nice taste.  I had some whole nutmeg that I ground up, and used fresh parsley.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for ZWT6 Zingo by and Unruly Under the Influence."
37449,426798,10/25/2010,5,"I used fresh breadcrumbs and had to add more dried breadcrumbs and an egg to make my ""meatballs"" to hold together, but they were delicious! I added a some mushroom sauce to the leftovers for a second delicious meal. Thanks! Made for Vegetarian Swap-Oct. 2010."
1816086,426798,2/3/2011,5,"This is a favourite of all great cooks.  Michael Fields' receipe was one of his best.  I learned to really cook using his well-written cookbook (you were really a student all way through!)  The mixtures and zestiest of the sauce are mouth-watering, just to think of them!  Of course, it's always better to use organic products and I substitue elk for beef because I can, living in the West."
706608,426798,9/20/2011,4,"Made mainly as written (Used almond milk for both the milk and soy creamer), and made fresh noodles to go with! I only got 9 balls (and that was stretching) So I would double it next time. Gravy is great, the balls themselves are very tasty but missing a bit of texture for me. I will try these again with some tweaks (maybe trying ground walnuts for the breadcrumbs)"
2001918898,426798,2/4/2018,4,"The sauce was awesome! I'm psyched to have another great, easy to make sauce in my repertoire. The &quot;meat&quot; balls were not so meaty. They had great flavor but were soft and mushy. I would definitely double the quantities for the balls, I got 8 not even an inch in diameter and had tons of leftover sauce. It said serve over pasta or mashed potatoes so I made gnocchi, I figure that's like both in one. All together it was awesome! I'll definitely try this again."
189616,61800,6/10/2005,5,"So this is what 'real' caesar salad dressing tastes like! NOTHING like supermarket brands where the only thing you taste is vinegar and parmesan. Perfect for my DH's birthday, even the color was gorgeous. Couldn't find flat anchovies, only the rolled ones, which I used and used the whole tin (minus the capers)
Thank You evelyn/athens!"
178504,61800,6/11/2005,5,"I have always wanted to know how to make a great Caesar salad - and now I do.  I followed the recipes exactly, and made homemade croutons as well. I also had a really good piece of Parm. cheese, which made it extra delicious. Loved it - so did my DH.  Thanks for sharing.    "
1356139,112715,4/11/2014,5,My grandchildren raved on this recipe!
1783373,483073,2/23/2013,4,"These peppers are not for the faint in pallet, rather they would suit those who like allot of flavor.  They are exotic and different from the traditional stuffed peppers.  The stuffing is quite nice and could be eaten on it's own, but stuffing them into the peppers did enhance them.  I struggled  somewhat with the flavors in the sauce as I found that 6 cardamon pods where too many and overwhelmed the other flavors, so to correct this I strained the sauce to be able to remove the cardamon pieces.   I also softened the flavors in the sauce by adding extra coconut milk, a little water and about a tsp. of sugar, otherwise I found it to be too sharp. Though the recipe didn't instruct to remove the outer cardamon pod, I did so because I believe they wouldn't cook through and would be woody.  Overall this is a nice dish, though I had to tweak the sauce to smooth-out flavors.  On it's own these are great as a main and side-dish.  I had fun making these as it transported my family and I to the flavors of India. Made it for ""Please Review My Recipe"" tag game."
498271,483073,6/12/2013,5,We really enjoyed these unusual and tasty stuffed peppers!  The potato filling was delicious on its own but the sauce really brought this to another level.  I used 1/2 tsp ground cardamom for the pods and used light coconut milk with excellent results.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!
2584658,494169,2/6/2016,4,"This &quot;mid-century&quot; salad is one of my favorites.  I had leftover lobster and used it and shrimp in the salad.  The reason I didn&#039;t give this recipe 5 stars was that I didn&#039;t think the black olives added any flavor and the cucumber was kind of in the way.   The sweet cherry tomatoes are perfect and you need the hard cooked egg, but next time I&#039;m leaving out the cuke and olives, and adding some capers.  The dressing, from the same cook, is absolutely 5 star!"
1808377,494169,9/15/2017,5,"Great salad, I threw in some avocado and it was awesome."
52282,61800,7/9/2003,5,"this is my favorite salad too, and my youngest picky eater loves this. i used 1 raw egg instead of 2 yolks and also used 6 anchovies, mashed, served some whole on my portion- this is wonderful and the way i've always made it!"
20371,61800,9/28/2003,5,"This is definitely a 5-star recipe. The blend of vinegars and lemon juice was perfect. My dressing turned out very garlicky, even with just 3 garlic cloves, but my cloves were plump and very fresh, so likely were more flavourful. I really enjoyed the garlic hit. The only ingredient change I made was minor: I subbed anchovy paste for the fillets. And I made this in my cuisinart, rather than whisking by hand. The dressing was easy to make, and was finished in minutes. I took this to a family dinner party honouring my MIL's birthday and watched as everyone cleaned their plates; the salad was a big hit. I also took my Zyliss grater to the party with me so I could cover the salad with freshly grated parmesan, which greatly contributed to both the taste of the salad and the look. Great recipe, Evelyn; it's in my permanent folder :-)"
10033,61800,1/11/2004,5,"Definitely five stars. Made this with Mean Chef's Fettuccine Alfredo and Tracy K's brussel sprout recipe. Really terrific--liked how many anchovy fillets were used, really perked up the flavor, and I found the addition of both vinegars to add a whole other dimension to the caesar dressing. Thanks for posting this Evelyn! "
144531,61800,7/30/2004,5,"Absolutely delicious. My family loves Caesar salad with store-bought dressing and they were floored by the homemade,more traditional version. My youngest son scoffed at the idea of anchovies (yuck) and raw egg yolks (nasty) until he tasted the salad.  Our 1/2 full bottle of purchased Caesar Dressing will go ignored!"
148068,61800,8/1/2004,5,This salad was the hit of our dinner last night! Even my kid's liked it.  My sweetie was still talking about it this morning.  I wouldn't change a thing!!!
81932,61800,10/17/2004,5,"I made this for a dinner party at a friends home. It was the hit of the night. The bowl was scraped clean and several people asked for the recipe. I made the dressing in the blender, used anchovy paste and served anchovies on the side"
162522,61800,5/10/2005,5,Intense & simply scrumptious; amazingly simple ~ wish I had attempted it long ago.  Recipe is a keeper!
115942,61800,5/15/2005,5,"I made a Casesar salad with chicken yesterday and used this recipe.  It was great. For me this also was the closest to restaraunt taste that I've found. Store bought just doesn't come close. However, I was out of fresh garlic and used powder. Next time though I will use fresh and I may adjust the vinegars a little and maybe try anchovy paste instead of fillets since it will spread better throughout the dressing. Still it was excellent!"
185708,61800,7/1/2005,5,"Perfect! I always fiddle with recipes, but the proportions of garlic/anchovy/vinegar/oil/lemon so right on that I'm not changing anything. My only substitution was canola oil for the olive oil. Also, I prepared it entirely in the food processor."
223112,61800,11/1/2005,5,"This is, hands down, the best Caesar salad I've ever had either at a restaurant or at home. It was superb. This will be my new and only Caesar salad recipe. Thanks Evelyn!"
68460,61800,12/25/2005,5,"This is wonderful Ev and it went very well with our prime rib dinner today.  I made as written, though I used a 3-inch 'squirt' of anchovy paste instead of the fillets.  The dressing has a wonderful kick to it.  Thanks for posting this recipe :)"
98016,61800,12/26/2005,5,"You've done it again, Evelyn!  Recipe was clear, easy to follow and most of all so tasty!  I prepared this tableside for my dinner guests and they were so impressed!   "
192957,61800,1/4/2006,5,made this last night and it was very good...
229850,61800,2/20/2006,5,This is a first for me. Never made the dressing from scatch before. Was a delight.Everyone loved it. thanx for sharing.
294255,61800,4/17/2006,5,"Thank you!  I was looking for a Caesar salad to serve with Shrimp Alfredo, and this was an awesome addition to the meal!  The flavors blended beautifully.  We did end up adding extra garlic, Worcestershire sauce and anchovies, only because my husband likes the extra 'zing'.  I suggest using the side of a large knife to make the garlic & anchovy paste, it worked well for me.  Thanks again!"
270514,61800,4/24/2006,4,"The garlic flavor was wonderful, but mine came out really thick.  I had made it in my food processor so maybe that way the problem.  Will try again without the machine."
39301,61800,10/14/2006,5,"This was the first time I made my own caesar dressing and it was a huge success!  I also made it in the food processor with no problem at all - not too thick, not too thin.  This dressing really has some bite to it!  I love it, but will probably serve it on side and let dinner guets add to taste just to be safe.  Thanks for sharing this.  I'll never buy store-bought caesar again!"
60496,61800,11/3/2006,5,"This has proven to be the best salad that we ever tasted. Every other week we pick up romaine lettuce hearts, and make a salad. Using either roasted chicken, salmon, or strips of left over prime rib. Great for lunch, or just a quick left over supper."
299707,61800,1/1/2007,5,"Evelyn, this dressing is fabulous.  Caesar is my favourite salad too and I've tried so many variations on the dressing, this one is by far the best.
Thanks again."
426000,61800,5/23/2007,5,"This dressing is fantastic.  We love it.  My husband, who never comments on food, even mentioned how good it was.  We'll be keeping this recipe for a long time!"
201946,61800,6/1/2007,5,Oh God! I LUUUUV IT! The best Caesar salad ever!
55578,61800,6/3/2007,2,"Well, I hate to rate this like this, but my family was not impressed at all.  I think the two vinegars WERE a  problem.  I think they just didn't work together.  I'm sorry, it's probably just my family's personal preference."
401564,61800,6/3/2007,5,"I love this dressing!  It is almost identical to the recipe I used in culinary school.  The only difference was that I mash the garlic with the salt, then mash it with the anchovies.  It's great without anchovies too, if you're guests prefer."
539951,61800,7/17/2007,1,I agree with Chill.  This was too vinegary for me.  A waste of ingredients.  Will definitely not make this again.
281330,61800,1/5/2008,5,Wow! What a good dressing.  I will make it again...soon I hope :)
241988,61800,2/8/2008,5,"Delicious Caesar....I've not made Caesar dressings from scratch very often, but this was easy and tasty. I used all white wine vinegar and left out the croutons.  Unlike the previous reviewer, we didn't think it was too vinegar-y at all.  We liked it alot.  Thank you!
UPDATE: I made this again and am eating it right now.  It is SO delicious!  I just had to say that :)."
155943,61800,2/25/2008,5,Fantastic! I was looking for a good caesar dressing recipe and this is it. I put the 1/2 c of parmesean cheese into the dressing as a personal preference.  This is a definite keeper!
161897,61800,2/28/2008,5,"Evelyn/Athens, you rock!  This caesar dressing truly is da bomb!  Seriously, I've been searching for the perfect caesar salad for the past 6 months and have tried umpteen recipes from cookbooks, the Internet and friends.  Most have been pretty good, but tonight I achieved Nirvana with this spectacular version.  I'm not looking any further!  For the record, I followed the recipe almost exactly.  My only changes were that I blended half of the parmesan cheese with the dressing and used the rest to sprinkle on top after it was tossed.  I also added a generous twist of freshly ground black pepper.  Thank you again for posting this spectactular recipe.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!"
192809,61800,4/12/2008,5,"This earned rave reviews at my recent dinner party.  I added a couple of extra cloves, and added a wee more lemon & Worcestershire.  Just a fantastic dressing."
464080,61800,3/4/2014,5,Delish!  We went to a tapas bar last evening and got their anchovies. . .but each only wanted a couple bites which meant leftover high quality lemon marinated anchovies.  They were screaming to be made into Caesar Dressing!!!  I just tasted the dressing and it&#039;s outstanding!  I will use it tonight on a salad for sure.  Thanks for this keeper of a recipe!
496803,61800,6/14/2008,5,"I made this for friends last night, and it was outstanding!  This dressing is just like the caesar dressing from a steakhouse I used to work for- very garlicy, and very tangy- in other words, just perfect.  I followed the recipe as written, except that I used anchovy paste, and only 1/2 cup of oil.  I also used my mini food processor instead of whisking by hand.  Thanks for a perfect dressing to go with my homegrown greens!"
535033,61800,8/2/2008,3,Hi-- Please remove this Review.  I accidentally wrote it for the wrong recipe.  Sorry!!!!
346860,61800,10/5/2008,4,"Pretty darn delish! I did add quite a bit more lemon in the end to get it where we like it, simply a family preference. Thanks for a great recipe!"
301111,61800,10/30/2008,5,I used my Magic Bullet (food processor) to blend the ingredients; I mixed everything first then added the oil.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used additional white wine vinegar.  I omitted the salt and decreased the oil as recommended by another reviewer.  A great way to use leftover egg yolks.  I put the leftover dressing in the fridge...
264745,61800,1/2/2009,3,"O.K.  Made it eaxactly as written. Dressing was fair but a little too acidic for me. Some guests snarfed it down...other's not so much. Would probably use less vinegar, more anchovies next time."
283474,61800,2/5/2009,5,"Excellent recipe, tasted like a Caesar Salad from a high class restaurant. My DH loves Caesar Salad and it won his approval.  I made it in my blender.  Thank you, Evelyn"
122871,61800,2/21/2009,5,"I absolutely adore this recipe, although I've altered it a little... in the effort to use less oil, I now do 4 Tablespoons olive oil, and 2 Tablespoons lemon juice, and the rest as is! This is our favourite salad dressing, it's healthy and delicious! We make a fresh batch at least once a week!"
140132,61800,3/24/2009,4,I made this last night for dinner and I will NEVER buy boughten caesar dressing again.  I whipped this up in the blender and it couldn't have been simpler.  I followed you directions except I added black olives and grape tomatoes to the salad.  Thank you for posting this delicious recipe.
773408,61800,3/30/2009,4,this was a really good recipe.   Very tart with the lemon juice and vinegar.  I think I will use just a touch less of one next time.  I will also add some pepper.  All in all an excellent recipe thanks for posting
333017,61800,5/6/2009,5,"Evelyn, I made your recipe with the intent to use it in #166669.  We loved the dressing.  I did add about 1 tsp of capers and a bit of the caper juice, because I do love capers in this dressing.  I also added a pinch of curry powder and black pepper.  I ran out of white vinegar, so I used lemon juice in place.  I made this with homemade crutons.  Thanks for the posting...I will use this one again!"
158086,61800,9/15/2009,5,Wow! This was the first time I made caesar dressing with eggs and it turned out fabulous...I did add some grated parmeasean cheese...such an easy great dressing.
1445414,61800,2/22/2010,5,"There is no better homemade ceasar salad dressing out there. Deserves far more than five stars. My hubby is not a huge fan of ceasar salad dressing however, he has no problem devouring any salad i make with this dressing. We normally use it in our seafood seasar salads. The combination of ingredients compliments the seafood wonderfully. I normally use anchovy paste to taste just because... and instead of 2 large egg yolks I use egg whites. (Hubby has high cholesterol and with all the oil the dressing allready has enough Saturated fat in it.) i find the egg whites give it a nice whiped texture. All in all hands down the BEST."
1239906,61800,6/21/2010,5,"I will use this recipe forever and ever.  Used anchovy paste in lieu of fillets and it turned out great!!  Very easy!  I used this to make Chicken Caesar Salad Pizza
Recipe #131203.  YUM!"
663997,61800,7/6/2010,5,Wonderful.  I added a little extra lemon juice.  I also used all red wine vinegar as I had no white.
675927,61800,1/9/2011,5,We loved it!!!! We cut down the amount of olive oil by 1/3 to increase taste and cut down on fat. It was so simple to mix up in the Magic Bullet and will definitely be a staple in our kitchen.
385761,61800,7/24/2012,5,This was wonderful!  Add some cooked salmon to it and we had a wonderful entree salad.
2007590,61800,6/22/2013,5,"Wow! This is the best caesar dressing I have ever used! I added 1/2 tsp pepper, some extra dry mustard and 1 more clove garlic. I was amazed at how little vinegar and oil was used but WOW this dressing rocks!"
126440,61800,3/9/2014,5,Our new caesar dressing.  Always made another one and DH loved this one.  Used my hand bonder and it emulsified beautifully. Half a recipe was perfect for the two of us.
1581225,61800,11/8/2016,5,A great classic salad. When I'm short on time I often buy a store-bought Caesar but the extra time is worth it with this recipe. A flavourful dressing.
1802849661,61800,3/15/2017,5,This is absolutely wonderful! Definitely the best Caesar salad I've ever made and love that the dressing is from scratch too! So many call for bottled sauce nowadays!
2001634937,61800,7/20/2017,0,"I'm at the age that I have to be careful about eating raw eggs. What would you use instead of raw eggs? I've tried mayonnaise, but I never know how much to use. Any ideas?"
2001703848,61800,9/6/2017,0,I used raw cuddled eggs in this recipe and no one complained. In fact they cleaned the bowl everytime.
36944,76248,5/21/2004,5,This is a very easy and quick recipe to prepare that results in a delicious garlic bread.  Thanks for sharing it with us Sue!
5060,76248,5/23/2004,5,"Thanks Sue for a really good garlic bread, quick and easy too!
Instead of garlic granules, I spread roasted garlic on the bread as you suggested, wow, was it good!! Served it with Glitter's Shrimp scampi, it was a perfect match.  Thanks for posting."
118163,76248,6/3/2004,5,"I made two of these for my BIG memorial day pizza party, and everyone loved it. (I loved it because it was very quick for me to make while I was preparing the pizzas for the oven.) People loved the cheeses on this bread, and I had to give out the recipe to a few people. Thank you so much!"
194221,76248,2/14/2005,5,Thank you for a splendid recipe. It is easy and quick to prepare.I roasted the garlic. The taste and aroma are five star. I recommend eating while hot.
160974,76248,3/21/2006,5,"I chose this recipe since the two-part baking process sounded neat. I cant' remember the last time I enjoyed home-made garlic bread this much. 

Roxygirl"
173579,76248,10/8/2006,5,Very good bread.  Thanks for posting.
327600,76248,1/4/2007,4,"This is another one of those reviews where I'm not sure to review or submit a new recipe, but here goes:  I used just plain old sliced white bread, toasted it slightly beforehand, and sprinkled with garlic powder and dry parsley flakes.  Then I used dried grated parmesan cheese with mozza, so yeah, does that count as making this recipe?  In any case, we loved it and I will definitely be making garlic bread this way again.  Thanks!"
102299,149046,1/2/2006,5,"I made these for a Christmas cookie and couldn't believe  how good they were. It was a bit of work but sooooo worth it. after dipping them and waiting for the chocolate to harden a bit I tasted one and was kind of disapointed but the next day I put them in a plastic container and they ended up being one of the most chocolatey, yummy, chewy cookies I've had. Almost an espresso taste. Just wonderful flavor! Thanks!"
